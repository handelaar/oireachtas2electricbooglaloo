      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I seek leave to move the suspension of the Dáil to consider the following matter of urgent public importance: the serious public concern about the circumstances in which the State agreed to accept pleas of guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter in the case of those who had been charged with the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe; the particular concern that acts of intimidation may have led to crucial evidence being withheld from the court, and the need for the Attorney General, in accordance with the terms of the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974, to discuss with the Director of Public <Col N="1386" /> Prosecutions the policy considerations that should be considered prior to the State entering into plea bargaining in cases of major public importance.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods): It is proposed to take No. 11, motion re. Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning mutual assistance in relation to criminal matters; No. 28, Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, Second Stage (resumed), and No. 4, Road Transport Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 11 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We will not agree to business being taken in the House until we receive a commitment that the Taoiseach will make a statement about what happened yesterday. Does the Minister not realise that there is profound shock, anger and concern at the decision of the State to accept a plea of manslaughter in a case of blatant murder of a member of the Garda Síochána and the serious wounding of another? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot agree to the Order of Business until we receive a commitment that a statement will be made, today if possible but certainly by next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that all Members of the House are very deeply concerned about this matter. She will also be very fully aware &ndash; and indeed it is recognised by all sides in the House &ndash; that the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the conduct of prosecutions. That has been the position since 1974 when the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was established, and established for very good reasons, with support from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>No member of the Government has any role in relation to the prosecution of criminal offences. The Government has no involvement whatsoever in this matter. The case is still before the courts and sentencing is due today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume I will get a chance to see the Minister's statement. The Minister is reading from a prepared statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a discussion on this matter. You requested a comment from the Minister, Deputy. Please let the Minister reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very well established and recognised that the Attorney General is independent of the Government and it is important that the public at large recognise this fact. It would not be appropriate for the Government to seek to dictate the manner in which either officer conducted his affairs. There are very good reasons why matters pertaining to the prosectution of offences were taken out of the political domain and I am sure that nobody in this House would wish to argue otherwise. It is not something to which we can take an <i>à la carte </i>approach. Prosecution policies and decisions are either in the political domain or they are not. That was agreed and settled a long time ago. If we want exceptions to this we should change the law but I do not believe the reasons for taking the matter of prosecutions out of the political domain are any less <Col N="1388" /> valid today than they were in 1974 when that matter was settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to protest. The Minister has a written script. Will I not be allowed ask my question?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I make these points quite clear. That is the position under the law, well established for very good reasons and accepted by all sides. Members on this side are just as concerned and will be just as anxious as Members on the other side of the House. The decision is an independent one, taken away from the political arena in 1974, and it must stay that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Chair's prerogative. The Minister's statement arose from Deputy Owen's question which I allowed her to ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not prepared to allow No. 11 on the Order of Business without debate. We want the Order of Business changed, something only the Government can do. My office was informed early today that the Taoiseach would not take the Order of Business because he was in transit to Copenhagen. Fortunately, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is here and the court will have given its judgment before the end of Question Time this afternoon. Accordingly, if the Minister for the Marine is to be believed &ndash; and I do believe him &ndash; I ask the <Col N="1389" /> Government to ensure that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will come into the House after Question Time to make a statement in a form and manner to be agreed by the Whips and to answer questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party in calling to have this matter dealt with today, subject to the requests that have been made. While I accept that the Government had no role in yesterday's decision, I resent the implication that an <i>à la carte </i>approach is being sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>A capital murder is known and recognised to be a special kind of crime requiring special attention. The matter of an investigation into charges of intimidation must equally be answered. I call on the Government to have this investigation put in place and to amend the law if necessary to avoid this type of loophole being used again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not agreeing to No. 11 being taken without debate until assurances are given that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will explain the situation to the House. The Minister, in his prepared statement which I object to because we were not informed that it would be made, said that the Attorney General was not answerable to the Government. Does this mean that, under the 1974 Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions consulted with the Attorney General or did he not? The Minister appears to be confirming that there was consultation between the DPP and the Attorney General. This is the key.</P>
      <P>I do not say they interfered in any way but I wish to know what prior knowledge the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach had of the fact that this change of charge was to be made. When did they have this knowledge? When my colleague, Deputy Noonan, raised this matter yesterday morning the Taoiseach appeared to want to answer that question. He appeared to know something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been getting away with the response of &ldquo;no evidence&rdquo; for too long. They should own up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach appeared to know. If the Chair is to allow statements to be made, Sir, we wish to know when the Government had information that this arrangement was being <Col N="1390" /> entered into. Where does the charge of manslaughter lie in our law now that it has been so diminished by the plea made yesterday by men who took a gun, pointed it into the confines of a car and shot multiple bullets into the bodies of two members of the Garda Síochána? How could anyone call that anything but murder? </P>
      <P>My next point is crucial to the peace process. In all statements made by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and every other Minister at the time of the signing of the British-Irish Agreement, assurances were given that those convicted of the murder of Detective Garda McCabe would not benefit from the prisoner release programme. However, these men will not be convicted of the murder of Jerry McCabe. They will be convicted of manslaughter. As one lawyer said on RTE this morning, there is no signed protocol to the British-Irish Agreement which covers this situation. The release programme is guaranteed merely by the word of the Government.</P>
      <P>There is deep concern that these men, once convicted of manslaughter, will become party to the prisoner release programme, despite assurances given by the Taoiseach and the Minister. Because the charge has been dropped from murder to manslaughter for which a mandatory 40 year sentence will not be given, we need an assurance as to where stands the commitment given during the British-Irish Agreement negotiations that these men would not walk free after a few years. We need an answer to that question. It is only fair that I ask these questions to ensure that when statements are made we will get all the answers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made clear yesterday his attitude to this, the position he has taken and the Government's position on this.</P>
      <P>On the questions raised by Deputy Quinn, the problem is that this case is before the courts and sentencing is due today. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no difficulty in answering questions after the case is completed in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot interfere with the work of the courts. If the Whips want to consider the best timing for taking this matter, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is prepared to respond to it as long as he or the House does not interfere with the case before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that it is understood outside this House that this House cannot interfere with the work of the courts. The Minister is willing to answer questions when the case is completed. The Taoiseach made it clear that he had no prior knowledge of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be orderly on the Order of Business. We are discussing the net point of whether we will accept No. 11 without debate. I am opposed to accepting it without debate until I get a commitment from the Government that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is prepared to come into the House, and from his body language he appears to be willing to do so, to answer questions after the end of Question Time. By that time we can safely assume the court will have delivered its sentence. While Members of this Assembly welcome the lecture on the procedures of the Dáil and the separation of powers between this House and the courts, it is not new. I ask not only that the Minister would come into this House, but in view of the latitude that was given to other Opposition spokespersons I wish to put questions to him in advance so that he will know about what we want him to prepare. There is outrage across the country about two aspects of this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the House to take note of Standing Order 56 paragraph 3 which states that a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the function of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is already in the public domain by way of newspaper reports and the newspapers will carry as much weight on the deliberations of the court as anything we might say here. I refer to widespread intimidation of six witnesses and the course of action that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to take to ensure that witnesses will not be intimidated in any cases in the future. I am not referring to the case that will be deliberated on today; I am talking about the problem of intimidation as a result of the continued operations of the IRA and where these people are pleading guilty to a <Col N="1392" /> charge of manslaughter in relation to the murder of Garda McCabe. Before we accept the Order of Business and not divide this House, I want a clear and unequivocal response from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, that on the assumption that the court will have delivered its sentence before the end of Question Time we will be able to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform questions on this matter. That is my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has no difficulty with that as long as that assumption is accepted. At approximately 3.30 p.m. we can have statements on this matter provided the sentencing has been delivered and the case is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on this matter. The Minister agreed to this as long as the court has passed sentence, but if leave is given to appeal the case there is a danger the Minister might use that decision as a reason not to come into the House. We need to show the relevance of this House. Today is the day we must have a statement on this case, even if an appeal is allowed. The Minister must be allowed to come into the House to give us whatever information he can. As a former Minister for Justice, I know how difficult it is for a Minister to come into the House to respond to a matter such as this, but I was always made to do so and I did so when I was Minister long before investigations were completed, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>When does the Government propose to implement the recommendations of the report of the expert group on child care which was published yesterday?

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a statement on this. He said he is setting up an interdepartmental committee which is necessary and he has given it a limited time to put forward its proposals. The committee will examine not only this report but two others which are directly related, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. These three reports are relevant to any resolution of the issues involved in this matter. These reports are important and it is necessary that their recommendations are considered as a matter of urgency, and for that reason the Minister has set a time limit for the interdepartmental committee to put forward its proposals.</P>

      <P>On a separate matter, the Government has failed to bring forward legislation to give effect to the British-Irish Agreement com<Col N="1394" /> mitment to establish of a human rights commission. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in the House and is manifestly busy with many other matters and there are 20 Bills I ask him, through the acting Head of Government, if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be prepared to accept the Labour Party's Bill on Second Stage and to proceed to Committee Stage when it can table whatever amendments it considers necessary, given the all-party support for the British-Irish Agreement. There is broad agreement on this legislation. To reject it would merely signal pride on the part of the permanent government of the Departments, of whatever label, which will not accept legislation introduced by the Opposition because it was not born in their back yard. The first anniversary of the British-Irish Agreement is less than two months away and I ask the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, who is overburdened, to accept this legislation on Second Stage and to table whatever amendments the Government considers necessary on Committee Stage, given that there is 95 per cent agreement in the Republic on this issue. The Minister should show some progress in implementing this agreement. He is hopelessly behind his own timetable in regard to it.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last spoke on this Bill on 26 November 1998 I referred to the planning laws. The Sports Council should look into this area. Developers are building hundreds of houses in housing estates around the country but are not providing any sports facilities, not even playing pitches. It is vitally important that developers, who are making large amounts of money from developing sites and building houses and are bringing many young people into areas, provide facilities. A levy should be put on developers of large housing estates so that this type of facility can be provided. Throughout the country we have seen what has happened where developers have built housing estates and then left the county council to carry the can. The county council has been unable to find funding and the whole matter has dragged on.</P>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I gave the example of the village of Monksland where up to 1,000 people do not even have a soccer pitch. It has taken Roscommon County Council six months to build a 50 yard long fence. This delayed a project for young people in that locality and led to many social problems there. The Sports Council should examine the planning implications of that case. Sport is a great asset for young people and there is a huge social aspect to it in combating drug and alcohol abuse. The biggest substance abuse in the country does not concern heroin or cannabis, but alcohol. If we are to begin to combat some of the problems associated with drug abuse we must provide adequate sports facilities.</P>
      <P>Some 40 per cent of 17 year olds have used drugs on a regular basis and up to 20 per cent of 13 year olds have done so. Some surveys show that the rate of substance abuse is 50 per cent higher here than in many European countries. There is no point in banning everything outright and telling young people to say no to drugs unless we provide basic facilities for them. It is crucially important to provide sports facilities and community centres. Unless young people have an outlet in their own localities other than the pub and mixing with a crowd they should not become involved with, we will have serious problems. We can pontificate all we like in this Chamber, but unless we provide alternatives for young people we will not help them to avoid substance abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National lottery grants have been a vital asset in developing facilities for youth organisations. Sadly, however, much of the money has drifted into health care and other areas. We should <Col N="1399" /> divert adequate funds into the areas the lottery was set up to benefit, such as the swimming pool in County Roscommon. I hope the Minister will provide funds in the current year for that pool. The existing facility has been closed for the past two months. The Minister for Finance visited the area last week to see the facility.</P>
    <P>We talk about encouraging young people to swim and we emphasise water safety, yet in every midland county including Portlaoise, Roscommon and other midland areas, there are problems with swimming pools. The Minister should target these areas rather than some of the super swimming pool developments in coastal areas. The Minister represents a coastal county and he has a priority there, but we must look at counties where young people do not have access to the sea or to swimming lessons during the summer months. Young people living in coastal areas have a better opportunity to learn to swim than those in midland counties. We must give the latter the same opportunities.</P>
    <P>We saw in newspaper reports this week that surfing has been banned in Strandhill, but sadly it was too late for three young individuals who had attended school in County Roscommon. They did not have the opportunity to learn how to swim, but perhaps they could have been saved on that occasion had they learned. The community in Ballaghaderreen has raised £100,000 to build a swimming pool and is waiting for approval from the Department. We must examine blackspots where facilities are needed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the move towards a regional sports centre in Athlone. It is a welcome development which, hopefully, will be up and running soon. Throughout the country there is a lack of facilities such as swimming pools and regional sports centre. If we are really committed to sport we need to build basic facilities for young people and adults alike rather than talking about 50 metre swimming pools and big multinational projects. Without the basic facilities we cannot develop swimmers who will be able to compete in years to come. Much can be done through national lottery funding which has, unfortunately, been diverted to other areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the various points I have raised. I support the Bill and wish the Sports Council every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which will establish the Irish Sports Council. A number of points have been raised about the council's proposed activities. Its first move should be to develop an integrated national plan for the development and promotion of sport. As part of this plan it will have to examine the possibility of erecting a national stadium in Dublin consultants are currently examining this matter. The recent proposals by the FAI are part of an ongoing examination of a facility that would attract many national and international sporting events to the capital. The technological aspects of the FAI's <Col N="1400" /> plan are worthy of close examination. I have no doubt that in examining the plan the Government will take on board the various technologies used to operate such a stadium, many aspects of which are quite attractive. I do not know if there is room for a number of such stadia, but the concept of a stadium of that kind in Dublin is one that the Government and the new Sports Council should move towards in their efforts to establish this country as a major centre for sporting activity on the world stage.</P>
      <P>The requirements for regional event centres should also be examined. In looking at many of the issues on a national scale these projects are attracted to urban centres, particularly the capital city. This can often occur at the expense of the development of sport at regional level. Sites are available within each region that could be developed as regional event centres. They could be used for all sporting activities, thereby providing both a regional and national perspective for the promotion of international events. Such centres in each of the regions would also focus attention on sporting activity and developments within the regions.</P>
      <P>I hope the new Sports Council will take a bottom up approach, building upon the infrastructure that already exists in almost every county. School PE halls could provide the first port of call for the new Sports Council. All school administrators attempt to encourage primary pupils to participate in sport and this will prove to be a great strength for the development of the Sports Council. It in turn should use this established infrastructure to prop up its work.</P>
      <P>Huge investment is taking place in community halls throughout the country. They are put to general use in rural Ireland not only as social but as sporting centres. If investment was made in community halls in urban areas, they could be put to much greater use as sporting facilities at parish level.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned clubs and volunteers. Over the years, they encouraged participation in sport of all types when it was not fashionable. People have a natural attraction to supporting and developing our national games, but other clubs have emerged over the years. They have brought together communities and helped to develop them and individuals in terms of the support of a particular sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the bottom up approach is established by the national council, I hope it will consider facilities such as Buckley Park in my constituency. This was established by the local community coming together and raising funds voluntarily. It sought funding from the national lottery and gathered various amounts from fundraising events. It established a first class soccer field at county level. Buckley Park is an example of what one form of sport, in this case soccer, can achieve. The park is a great credit to all the volunteers in Kilkenny. However, it requires more funding and the support of the new national council for further development and to ensure it is placed on <Col N="1401" /> a secure footing for the future. In common with other soccer clubs, it has brought together young people who are keen on the development of the game and who want to participate because it is a high profile sport that they see on television. Given the establishment of this club and others in every county, the sports council must build on existing structures. Buckley Park is one example.</P>
    <P>While some parks are up and running, others are less developed. For example, the Evergreen soccer club in Kilkenny has applied for funding because it also wants to develop its club and grounds. The emergence of soccer and other clubs is due to demand at local level and the greater numbers of people living in urban housing estates. Clubs are responding to that demand and as the numbers and the activities increase, finance becomes a key issue.</P>
    <P>These clubs help to develop the personality and character of young men and women. They are given something to which they can aspire and a game in which they can participate. Some of them may even participate at a professional level in the future. It does not only provide sporting fulfilment. If the matter was considered in that light and the funding provided by various Departments for these activities was merged, there would be much more structured sporting facilities and more young people would be willing to participate and take responsibility. They would learn to be team players and to understand discipline.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny city is famed for its handballers. Most of these players emerged through the open handball alleys throughout the city. The O'Loughlins club received funding from the national lottery and provided an indoor handball alley. People can see people such as Ducksie Walsh playing there in national tournaments. Ducksie Walsh's skill was developed in the open handball alleys in the city. If the sports council examined the handball alleys built by local authorities and directed funding to them, it would discover that there is no need to build new handball alleys and infrastructure. It can build on existing structures and the success of local authorities.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities have provided swimming pools. Some of them were low cost projects at the time. Many years ago, they facilitated a new form of sport. It was a departure for local authorities to become involved in the provision of swimming pools, which proved to be a huge success. While recognising that a limited fund will be available, the national council could list the swimming pools countrywide and use that infrastructure. It could support it financially and provide funds for additional facilities such as gymnasiums, coffee docks and public arenas. These would attract the public. The local authority or the private club running the pool would have the status of operating under the structures of the sports council, thereby ensuring access to funds for developing the facility. If the council is proactive in its approach to the task, it should use existing handball alleys, clubs, community centres <Col N="1402" /> and swimming pools as a basis on which to build all-round sporting centres.</P>
    <P>If the sports council considers Kilkenny, one of its first tasks should be to ensure that the development of the swimming pool is undertaken in partnership with the local authority. This pool is open from 6 a.m. until almost 12 midnight. There are employees paid by the local authority but others give their time on a voluntary basis. If the sports council took a proactive approach and money was made available, a fine facility could be established there at very low cost. Given the development of Kilkenny and the population explosion which has taken place there, the project should be taken on by the sports council at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The development of indoor sports in all counties is ongoing. Many people are involved in all types of indoor sport and particular attention should be given to the development of these sports. Ladies' sports are often forgotten in the debate on sport, which is sometimes given a narrow definition. However, many fine female athletes participate at club level and higher. An all inclusive policy is required, which should also encompass sport for the disabled. This aspect needs to be developed locally in terms of clubs, organisations and swimming pools and ensuring money is invested to allow the full participation of disabled people. They should be able to access and use pools and gymnasiums.</P>
    <P>This will require heavy investment but it is necessary to ensure an all inclusive approach to sport. However, the burden of investment can be made lighter by using existing infrastructure. There is an army of volunteers who are willing to participate in the development of sport. In Ireland more than any other country, sport is a way of life. On Sundays, families go to see hurling and football matches. This has established the sporting ethos in Ireland and the sports council will receive support from these people. Where a self-help ethos is established in a county, the sports council could tap into that energy. The Graiguecullen swimming pool and community development project is being considered for national lottery funding. The project will serve a number of counties and has the support of people not only in Graiguecullen but in Carlow, Laois and Offaly. Many people believed the project would not get off the ground but as a result of the support of Fr. Fingleton and a number of community groups, it is currently on the drawing board and ready to proceed. It would be an important element of the overall development of sport in the area.</P>
    <P>Another unusual development in Carlow which highlights voluntary involvement in sporting organisations is the Carlow Rowing Club. Most of us might regard rowing as an elitist sport but there are almost 400 members in the club. The fact it has existed for almost 150 years is a reflection of the support it has received throughout the community, the county and neighbouring counties. The club is considering developing its range <Col N="1403" /> of sporting and social activities to encourage participation by young people in the town. This reflects a very positive approach to the development of local communities.</P>
    <P>The sports council will not be in a position to act on its own. If it acts in conjunction with the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Environment and Local Government, it will have a huge resource at its disposal. By adopting a partnership approach, I believe the council will prove very beneficial to the development of young people and their communities.</P>
    <P>Clubs should provide facilities for sporting as well as social activities involving elderly and actively retired people. Some people may want to participate in a limited way in club activities, perhaps through supporting the development and administration of a club or by participating actively in swimming or other sports. The sports council should consider this issue. The age at which people retire is decreasing and retired people would be well served by being involved in sport.</P>
    <P>The use of drugs in Irish sport has been highlighted, although we have not been as seriously affected as other countries. The Minister outlined the steps which have been taken to keep sport free of substance abuse. Any action taken by the sports council in this regard will be supported. In recent years, the issue of substance abuse has made headlines in many countries. We should take whatever steps we can through education at primary school, club and community level to highlight this issue. It might perhaps offer the sports council an opportunity to arrange seminars and activities at club level to inform people that it is possible to participate in sport without relying on banned substances to improve performance. That important message must be conveyed in a positive manner. The initiative must come from club level upwards; advertising will not achieve the objective. The council must make a concerted effort to work with clubs on this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the sports council and commend the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this comprehensive Bill which is long overdue. The Bill sets out clearly the functions and other aspects of the council. In establishing the council and setting out clear policy guidelines, care must be taken to ensure the necessary financial commitment to meet objectives is put in place. Over the years, there has been strong criticism of the amount of financial commitment in the area of sport. Disappointment has been relatively widespread, particularly in smaller clubs and organisations, at the unavailability of national lottery funding as it was anticipated that a major proportion of lottery revenue would go into this area. I would support the Minister in whatever representations he might make to ensure the Minister for Finance provides the <Col N="1404" /> necessary budget to allow work in this area proceed.</P>
      <P>It is difficult not to comment on the haphazard manner in which sport has been treated to date. Various voluntary and professional organisations, local authorities and vocational education committees have been involved in its provision. If the sports council could achieve some level of co-ordination and co-operation between the various organisations involved in sports provision, it would represent a significant achievement.</P>
      <P>When one considers a Bill such as this, one tends to turn towards one's own constituency. One of the difficulties experienced in all constituencies, especially in the bigger towns, relates to the lack of adequate leisure and recreational facilities, be they swimming pools or playing fields. A very good case has been made by united sporting and leisure organisations in Ennis for the provision of playing facilities in the area. The group is currently undertaking the provision of 12 playing pitches in the town. Even that number is not adequate to meet the huge demand. There are many young soccer players, footballers and hurlers in Killaloe and other towns in County Clare but there is a great absence of facilities for them.</P>
      <P>There is a grave necessity for investment in the provision of facilities. Such investment would ensure that young people would not be drawn into anti-social behaviour. I pay tribute to all those people in County Clare who, on a voluntary and professional basis, have worked so diligently in recent years to provide sporting facilities. Football and hurling clubs throughout County Clare have made great efforts to provide pitches, recreation halls and leisure facilities. It is an uphill struggle because there are so many organisations trying to raise funds. It is almost impossible to raise the level of funding required.</P>
      <P>In developing long-term policy in this area care must be taken to back it up with the necessary finance. Travel costs alone put a burden on the families of promising young athletes, many of whom have had to abandon their aspirations because they cannot raise the finances necessary to avail of training and go to competitions.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. I assure the Minister of my fullest support and compliment him on bringing it forward and on the very innovative way he is approaching this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank all 32 Deputies who contributed to this debate. Deputy Naughten mentioned Roscommon swimming pool. Deputy Seán Doherty, Senator Michael Finneran and others have made me fully aware of the disgraceful condition of Roscommon swimming pool, but I wonder what was done during the time of the previous Administration. I am quite sure it was in the same dilapidated and disgraceful condition at that time. I am taking that matter on board. I will send an official from my Department next week or the week after to look, in an official capacity, <Col N="1405" /> at the swimming pool, and I can assure the Deputy that during this Government's term of office, Roscommon swimming pool will be looked after.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill coincided with the death of Noel Carroll. Many Deputies have paid tribute to him. As Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation I too pay tribute to the late Noel Carroll who was an Olympian athlete, Chief Executive of Dublin Chamber of Commerce and former spokesman for Dublin Corporation. These are just some of his more public titles. However, the measure of a man is not the number of titles he possesses but the manner in which he carries out the various roles in his daily living.</P>
      <P>Noel Carroll exemplified an accomplished man, and did so in the humblest of ways. His life was lived to the fullest and at a pace that many of us could never attempt to emulate. His dedication to the task at hand was always more than 100 per cent. Whether it was the logistics for conferring freedom of Dublin City on President Clinton or as he coached student athletes at Belfield, his fierce determination to see things done the right way won many a day.</P>
      <P>As a sportsman, Noel Carroll was the embodiment of what our ideal athlete should be. His involvement in sport was legendary. Both as a participant and as a mentor his contribution to Irish sporting successes was immeasurable. With the passing of time his loss will become more keenly felt and much more evident to all who are involved in sport. His premature death has left a great void in the lives of his wife Deirdre, their children, Enda, Nicola, Noel and Stephen, their grandchildren, his extended family, friends and colleagues. To all who knew Noel and mourn his sudden passing, on behalf of this House, I extend deepest sympathy.</P>
      <P>I thank all 32 Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important legislation.</P>
      <P>Sport is an integral part of our society and plays an important role in promoting personal and community development, in contributing to our economic and social prosperity and in improving the health and well-being of each of our citizens. The creation for the first time of a statutory sports council is intended to further enhance the role of sport in these areas, and I welcome the overwhelming support of the House for this Bill which enables the establishment of the council.</P>
      <P>As we will go into greater detail on the various provisions of the Bill at the next Stage when I will deal with the many valid points raised, I will be brief in my response to the points raised by the Deputies on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen asked that the Bill specifically provide for the Sports Council to have responsi<Col N="1406" /> bility for all lottery funding for sport &ndash; a sudden change in the Deputy's attitude &ndash; to allay any public suspicion that funding for projects is awarded on the basis of political consideration rather than on merit. The approach that has been adopted in the Bill is to provide an enabling framework which allows the level of funding to be determined by the Government of the day. I am sure Deputies would support that. Such a framework provides the scope for Governments, present and future, to apply the policy approach which they consider most appropriate at the time, having regard to national priorities in general and the needs of the sporting section in particular.</P>
    <P>The review of the Sports Capital Programme and the issue of sports facilities generally were raised by almost all Deputies. The review group, comprising representatives of Government Departments and public authorities involved in facility provision, completed its deliberations late last year, following which a new programme has been developed with revised aims and objectives, assessment criteria, terms and conditions. I have already arranged to have the new application form and the guidelines relating to the new programme circulated to all Deputies for their information. That programme has been published in all the national newspapers and there has been a huge response to funding for this year.</P>
    <P>As part of the new programme, applicants will be required to increase participation levels in their sport or recreation and to consult other facility providers in their areas with a view to avoiding overlap and duplication. The assessment process will involve consultation with Government Departments and agencies involved in the provision of facilities and with the national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the programme, and the one which picks up on a point raised consistently throughout the debate, is to promote a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation, thereby giving better value for State investment. We have to have a more strategic development of sport &ndash; there are areas where there are four swimming pools along a 50 mile tract of road and none in other areas. We have to have a strategy of better State investment. There is approximately £16 million in funding, committed by various Governments, for projects which, for one reason or another, perhaps because grants were too small or were scattered too thinly, have never got to the stage of development. There is £16 million and more than 780 projects awaiting completion. I do not want to see plans in my Department. I want to see these plans, which show a huge level of entrepreneurial activity among the voluntary workers who put them forward, in three-dimensional form that people can use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen also referred to the review of the outdoor education centres for which responsibility rests with the Department of Education and Science. I understand that the review is now complete and that a report was recently presented to <Col N="1407" /> the Minister for Education and Science who is now considering it.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies emphasised the need for greater co-ordination between Departments and public bodies in the promotion and development of sport. This is an issue to which I have already referred in the context of the review of the sports capital programme. The Bill specifically addresses this issue by assigning the council, under section 6, with the specific function of co-ordinating recreational sports strategies and, under section 7, the powers to co-operate with, advise and assist various bodies, including all public authorities, in relation to its functions.</P>
    <P>The recognition of bridge as a sport was raised by many Deputies. I am well aware of the level of interest and participation in bridge. There was a recognition of bridge in my party's manifesto. As I have already said in the House a number of times, my priority has been to prepare this legislation to provide a framework for the future execution of sports policy, including policy on sports bodies. The recognition of individual sports and recreational activities, including bridge, will be a matter for the Sports Council to consider in the context of its statutory remit. Given the level of interest that has been expressed in this issue, I will ask the Sports Council to examine it as a matter of priority upon its establishment.</P>
    <P>The definition of sport in the Bill, raised by Deputies Ferris, Gilmore and others, is based on the internationally accepted Council of Europe definition as set out in the European Sports Charter. On a related matter, Deputy Ferris inquired as to the reason for splitting the definition into recreational and competitive sports categories. My aim here, and I know it is one shared by many Deputies, is to ensure that the council's focus is directed not just at high performance sports people who tend to capture the headlines, but also at the vast majority of people who want to participate in sport for recreation and enjoyment, regardless of age, sex or ability. The idea is that we do not provide only for the elite people who grab the headlines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris also noted that the Bill, while welcome, represents a missed opportunity in not providing for the creation of a body charged with addressing issues that form part of a social policy platform. The absence of specific functions to promote the full involvement of people with disabilities in sport and to target the facility and resource needs of disadvantaged areas were cited by the Deputy to support this view. I assure the Deputy that in framing the Bill these issues have not been overlooked. Section 9 requires the council to have regard to Government policy in carrying out its functions and to comply with policy directives issued by the Minister. As one of the cornerstones of this policy, the Government has committed itself to a fully inclusive society where every citizen has the opportunity and incentive to <Col N="1408" /> participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>Initiatives such as the pilot programme for disadvantaged areas, the drugs initiative, the young people's facilities and services fund and the new sports capital programme serve to underline this commitment. The current Sports Council has established a task force on people with a disability in sport to bring forward proposals to ensure their greater participation in sport in the future. The Deputy might wish to re-read my Department's strategy statement which has prioritised participation in sport and recreation by disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies in their contributions made reference to the issue of sport and physical education in schools. In relation to physical education, I share the Deputies' concerns about the quality of physical education provision in schools, as does my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who is responsible for this matter. In my opening address, I referred to the pilot project established earlier this year by the Department of Education and Science to introduce a new physical education curriculum in selected schools. This project is of particular significance in that it will help create the foundations for the successful introduction of a well-structured PE syllabus in our schools. The Minister for Education and Science is also keen to include PE as a recognised leaving certificate subject and to this end he has asked the NCCA to investigate the matter. I understand the Minister's intention is that PE be introduced into the leaving certificate curriculum in the school year 2001-02.</P>
    <P>On a related matter, I share the view expressed by many Deputies that the promotion of greater participation in sport and physical activity requires an approach that begins at school level. The Sports Council has been in ongoing discussions with the Department of Education and Science to develop initiatives to enhance PE and sport in schools. A number of issues raised by Deputies, such as the question of teaching and coaching sport in schools and the links between school and community sport, are among the issues being discussed. I am confident that the establishment of the Sports Council on a statutory basis will facilitate the creation of even greater links with the Department of Education and Science in promoting enhanced participation by all our children in sport and physical activity.</P>
    <P>The issue of drugs was also a common theme in contributions throughout the debate. Deputies will be aware of my well known abhorrence of the use of drugs in sport. The introduction of the national anti-doping programme has been one of my priorities since taking office. Deputy Allen questioned why the programme will not be operational until this year. As the Deputy is well aware, the introduction of the programme involves many complexities and clearly it is imperative that we get all the elements right from the beginning. This is a major initiative for Irish sport, with the testing programme in particular <Col N="1409" /> having the potential to significantly impact on the careers of individual sportsmen and women. The programme must have regard to legal issues, the views of all interested parties and the establishment of correct, complex operational procedures. All the necessary preparatory work on the logistics involved is now well under way. The Bill will unequivocally provide the statutory basis for the council to administer the anti-doping programme. I have every confidence that the Sports Council, when established, will operate the programme to the highest standards and will play a leading role in initiatives designed to combat this scourge.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Hanafin, raised the issue of women in sport and the reasons there are lower participation rates in sport among women than men. The current Sports Council has established a task force to address this issue with the aim of formulating a series of realistic and actionable proposals to overcome barriers to women participating in sport. I expect the task force to report shortly and the findings to form the basis for the statutory Sports Council to promote greater participation by women in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to Sydney 2000 and preparation for these games, I consider that initiatives in the area of funding national governing bodies of sport, particularly the introduction of the international carding scheme for players and athletes, will provide a solid foundation for aspiring Olympians. It must not be forgotten, however, that the preparation and selection of Irish teams for Olympic Games is, quite rightly, a matter solely for the Olympic Council of Ireland. The OCI thus plays a pivotal role in the promotion of Irish sport and, in this context, both myself and the Sports Council have a genuine desire to continue to develop better relationships with it.</P>
    <P>Ethics in sport was another theme running through most of the Deputies' contributions and, of course, the Bill provides for the Sports Council to specifically address this issue as part of its core functions. Deputies will be aware that earlier this year, in the aftermath of the issues raised by the Murphy inquiry, I reconvened the Code of Ethics Committee which was responsible for putting together the Code of Ethics in Sport. The committee has been given the task of updating the current publication to take account of the report of the inquiry and of important recent developments in the broad area of child protection.</P>
    <P>Once again I thank Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage. They raised many valid points which will be of great benefit to us in furnishing a more comprehensive debate on Committee and Report Stages. I thank Members of the Opposition for allowing the Bill to pass through the House today and I look forward to hearing further contributions on Committee Stage concerning the points raised by Deputies. There is a great amount of co-operation on the Bill and I assure Deputies that any worthwhile amendments they bring forward will be considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The road haulage industry in Ireland was liberalised in the late 1980s arising from European Union directives which were adopted in the 1970s. Ireland was somewhat behind other developed western economies in introducing liberalised competition in the haulage market. One of the consequences of such a restrictive policy has been a sector that has been slower to develop than elsewhere in western Europe. We see, therefore, an industry which in large part is made up of micro enterprises. Up to 70 per cent of the sector comprises one or two man operations. In many instances, people are coming into the business without a proper business plan and it would appear that, in many cases, they live from day to <Col N="1411" /> day with little planning or thought for long-term viability.</P>
    <P>The inevitable outcome is fierce competition and downward pressure on rates. I stress that there is nothing wrong with the latter provided that it is achieved as a result of efficiencies and is not done through working at cost or below cost or, indeed, by skirting the law. Recent years have seen troubled times for the sector. First, we had the collapse of Bell Lines with consequent losses to many hauliers. We then had the very serious difficulties at Dublin Port. The catalyst at the port was the major delays being experienced at port terminals leading to a drop in productivity. Equally, working conditions in the port were not good and there was a perception among hauliers that they were being treated badly.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been some improvement in both conditions and rates. An independent facilitator brought in to my Department played a vital role in bringing the dispute to a close but also in righting many wrongs in the treatment of individual hauliers and in conditions generally in the port. I hasten to add that we are not out of the woods yet. The threat over the magnificent Tall Ships extravaganza last summer was a timely reminder of that for us all. In advance of completion of the Port Tunnel, traffic congestion in and around the port remains a problem which is adding to the reduction in productivity of hauliers using the port.</P>
    <P>On the international front, it has also been a very difficult period for Irish hauliers. There was the disruption caused by the French drivers' strike in 1997. There were strikes by hauliers in Spain and Portugal. Subsequently, we had the problems created for hauliers by Welsh farmers who pursued their grievances with the British Government by blocking Irish hauliers at Holyhead and other Irish sea ports to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are problems in the sector which this Bill is, in part, addressing. On another front, colleagues will be aware that in the published Statement of Strategy of my Department, it was anticipated that a major review should be conducted into the haulage sector, including the potential for the application of intelligent transport systems, in co-operation with the industry itself, other Departments and Forfás. Following a competitive tendering process, a consortium of consultancy firms with extensive national and international expertise was appointed to carry out this review. The consultants commenced their work in July last year.</P>
    <P>I will set out the context in which this review is being undertaken. The report of the Forfás Transport and Logistics Group published in March 1996 placed emphasis on an integrated approach to infrastructure, transport services, logistics and warehousing-distribution. It saw transport and logistics as crucial elements in improving the competitive position of Irish firms. The Forfás report made it clear that it was not <Col N="1412" /> enough to simply improve our capabilities in the transport and logistics area. If we were to improve our competitive position, we would have to do better than competitor economies which are seeking to enhance their capabilities. The report's assessment was quite blunt. It stated:</P>
    <P>If Ireland fails to cope with the more demanding market and logistics environment which is rapidly emerging, exporters will lose competitiveness and market share and the longer term industrial development objectives will stand little chance of being achieved.</P>
    <P>That is the broad policy context within which the review of the road haulage industry is being initiated. However, the serious difficulties which have emerged in recent times gave the proposal to review the sector added urgency .</P>
    <P>It might be useful if I inform Deputies of the terms of reference for the review which I am sure they will agree are comprehensive. The mandate to the consultants was to review the road haulage industry under a number of headings and to propose a coherent strategy for the development of the industry which would encompass: a clear vision for the future development of the industry in the context of Ireland's wider economic requirements, supported by concrete aims and objectives and a clear and precise medium-term and long-term strategy for the future development of the industry, identifying in particular those strategic matters which need to be urgently addressed. The development of the strategy should take account of the fact that the road haulage sector is not a single homogeneous industry, but a range of discrete subsets serving different market requirements.</P>
    <P>The consultants were also mandated to identify any institutional and other constraints to the effective implementation of the strategy and propose measures to effectively address those constraints.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say the report is now nearing completion. This is the first major review of the structure of the Irish road haulage industry ever undertaken. The outcome will provide an informed basis on which to plan for the future of a sector which, in itself, is a major contributor to the Irish economy and is vital to the interests of Irish industry as a whole. To propose action on the basis of anything less would be irresponsible. This is the background against which we are embarking on this Bill. Inevitably, the Bill will not address all the issues. It will, however, put in place significant statutory measures of concern to the sector. I will give a general outline of the main objectives of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is both timely and desirable in the context of existing forces impacting on the road transport sector. The main elements of the Bill are the introduction of a licensing regime for both haulage and bus operators involving the issue of licences of up to five years' duration, instead of the current three or five year maximum duration; the replacement of a previously cumbersome <Col N="1413" /> vehicle plating procedure, involving my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda, with a transport disc regime provided solely by my Department and the application of that disc regime to the passenger sector for the first time; measures designed to ensure compliance by out of State hauliers with Irish road transport legislation; the introduction of a requirement on both haulage and passenger operators to provide adequate parking space and operating facilities for the vehicles to be operated under their licences; the amendment of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to provide for consignor liability in the case of overweight vehicles; the amendment of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to extend from five miles to 25 kilometres &ndash; over 15 miles &ndash; the distance a driver can be directed to a weighbridge for weighing; and to bring in other changes of a technical nature to the Road Transport Acts, 1933 to 1986.</P>
    <P>It would be useful at this stage to outline the background to the regime for haulage and passenger operator licences. We are not dealing here with route licences, which are a matter to be considered under the Road Transport Act, 1932, but with those licences which allow access to the profession of road passenger operator.</P>
    <P>The most recent amendment to the Road Transport Acts was the Road Transport Act, 1986. This Act and a series of EU directives which came into effect over the past decade have amended the basis for admission to the road haulage and bus operator sectors. The directives also began the process of harmonising the regime pertaining to the regulation of the haulage and bus transport sectors throughout the EU and liberalisation of access to those sectors.</P>
    <P>Prior to the passage of the Road Transport Act, 1986, access to the road haulage industry in Ireland was restricted on a quantitative basis which effectively excluded prospective enterprises from setting up in business. The opening up of access was prompted partly by domestic policy considerations, such as the need for growth in the sector and the desirability of a more competitive environment to provide the manufacturing and trading arms of the economy with modern, professionally-run services at reasonable cost. The development of a common European Community policy aimed at allowing open competition on a quality control basis gave an added impetus to the liberalisation process.</P>
    <P>Access to the road haulage and bus operator sectors is now regulated solely on the basis of qualitative requirements set down in European Union directives. Entrants to the business must satisfy the licensing authorities in member states that they are financially sound, of good repute and under competent management. It should be noted that there has been further raising and harmonising of the standards for access by virtue of a directive adopted in 1998. The new stricter criteria will take effect for new entrants in October this year. Under the directives any person who meets the criteria for access must be issued with <Col N="1414" /> a licence. Currently, both the criteria for obtaining a licence and the issuing of a licence are set down in statutory instruments made pursuant to the European Communities Act, 1972. It is intended to continue that arrangement and to consolidate it by revoking the licensing procedures in primary legislation and incorporating them in comprehensive regulations following enactment of this Bill. This should make it easier for intending applicants to ascertain the statutory licensing requirements.</P>
    <P>Existing enterprises are periodically assessed for their continuing adherence to these standards. Until now, this reassessment has been automatically triggered on a three or five year basis &ndash; three in the case of domestic haulage operators, five in the case of international hauliers and all bus operators. The aim is that all enterprises will obtain a five year licence with a requirement to renew after that period. It is thought that this would be more rigorous and effective than a continuous regime which was mooted in the 1997 Transport Bill. This change in policy has the approval of the main representative organisations in both the haulage and passenger sectors.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is designed to ensure that breaches of the Road Transport Acts or regulations relating to the carriage of merchandise or passengers under the European Communities Act, 1972, can be prosecuted against out of State carriers in the course of a journey within the State. This is achieved by arresting any driver who a garda has reason to believe is committing or has committed an offence and who in the opinion of the garda has not given a satisfactory address for service of summons. The Bill defines what constitutes a satisfactory address as an address at which the person will be for a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to serve that person with a summons, or an address of some other specified person who will accept a summons on the first person's behalf. In such cases, the address of a firm of solicitors in the State which undertakes to accept a summons on behalf of the driver will satisfy this provision. The section is similar to a provision in the United Kingdom Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984, which is used extensively by UK police authorities to deal with out of State hauliers in breach of road traffic and road transport legislation in Britain.</P>
    <P>In the case of a driver of a vehicle being arrested under this section, the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, come into effect. The following is the procedure: the arrested driver is brought to the nearest Garda station; he is brought as soon as practicable before the District Court of the district in which the person has been arrested or he is released on bail to appear at the next appropriate sitting of the District Court; bail can be set by the station sergeant in accordance with section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967; bail can be in the form of recognisance or a sum of money, and it is lodged in the relevant <Col N="1415" /> District Court to the court clerk; and if the driver fails to appear before the court at the appointed time an application can be made under the relevant District Court rule to entreat the recognisance or to forfeit the sum of money.</P>
    <P>Another initiative in this area is the proposal in section 16 to introduce on-the-spot fines in respect of offences under the Road Transport Acts or under regulations made pursuant to the European Communities Act, 1972, relating to road transport. This section is an enabling one and it will be a matter for the Minister to prescribe the class of offences which will be dealt with under this section.</P>
    <P>A transport officer or a garda who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing an offence under the regulations may issue a notice to that person stating that the person is alleged to have committed the offence; the person may make a payment of £150 without delay to the inspector; and a prosecution will not be pursued if the payment is made to the inspector without delay.</P>
    <P>This provision is significantly different from the existing on-the-spot fines as we know them. The current system is an invitation to pay a certain amount of money within 21 days and, if payment is made, no prosecution will ensue. The system proposed here is an invitation to pay a sum of £150, without delay, to either a garda or a transport officer. If the driver refuses to pay and does not have a satisfactory address for service of summons, the provisions of section 13 can come into play. If the driver has a satisfactory address for service of summons and does not pay the fine he can be prosecuted in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The fine is currently set at £150. However, the Minister may vary this amount by regulation at any time in order to take account of inflation or if it is felt that a fine set at this level is not a sufficient deterrent or that the offences being committed demand greater fines. Flexibility is provided in the Bill as to currencies and the methods of payment which will be accepted.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Bill which is timely are the provisions of section 17 which amend the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in two ways. First, section 12 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is amended to include the consignor of the load as one of the persons liable to prosecution in the case of overweight vehicles. The section also provides for two good defence clauses which are common sense. I am pleased to bring forward this provision.</P>
    <P>The current statutory position under the Road Traffic Acts is that only the driver and the owner of the vehicle are liable to prosecution for overloading. It is my belief, however, that drivers are often pressurised to carry overweight loads given the competitive nature of the haulage sector and the possibility of losing business if they refuse to carry the loads consigned. By making the consignor also liable to prosecution, the Bill will reduce the pressure on drivers to carry overweight loads. Clearly it is not in the best interests <Col N="1416" /> of either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to carry overweight loads. First, there is the road safety aspect, the danger to the driver and other road users is inevitably increased from overweight loads, second, there is the question of increased damage to road infrastructures and third, overloading exposes expensive equipment to a burden for which it has not been designed, with long-term damage as a possible consequence.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to the Road Traffic Act is the proposal to extend from five miles to 25 kilometres, about 15 miles, the distance a driver can be directed to a weighbridge for weighing. I have long been of the view that some drivers regularly use unsuitable back roads in order to avoid known weighbridges. I hope this new provision will put a stop to this practice and, importantly, will be an additional incentive for drivers, owners and consignors to avoid carrying overweight loads.</P>
    <P>A provision I am also pleased with is contained in section 11 which requires that all licensees, both haulage and passenger operators, must provide adequate parking spaces and operating premises for the vehicles operating under the licence. The objective of this provision is twofold. First, it is an effort to ensure that vehicles operating under a licence have adequate parking space. The provision is not designed to compulsorily require the owner to park the vehicle at the premises, nor does it prevent owners-drivers parking vehicles at unsuitable areas such as housing estates. This is best achieved by local authority by-laws. However, it ensures there are adequate parking facilities available at the site.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to ensure that there is a premises at which the licensee is located. In recent years there has been a tendency, albeit by a very small number of licensees, to have accommodation addresses. These addresses can often be the offices of a solicitor or accountant where visits to inspect tachograph charts can be difficult and frustrating. There is a concern also that persons refused licences elsewhere in the European Union can apply for licences in the State and use accommodation addresses to facilitate their applications. The section also provides for a three year breathing space for existing licensees to meet the requirements for adequate parking spaces and operating premises.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provisions in the Bill relating to transport discs, the objective is to establish a one-stop-shop for the issuing of such discs. In the past vehicle plating was regarded as overly bureaucratic by the haulage sector. For instance, the plating procedure involved the following for each vehicle: the operator obtained his licence with the vehicles stated on the licence, he then went to the Revenue Commissioners with the licence document to pay for the plate and then took the receipt to the PSV officer in the local designated Garda station where he obtained the vehicle plate. This procedure was rightly deemed cumbersome in this day and age. Subsequently, my <Col N="1417" /> Department, by means of a statutory regulation, reduced the number of transactions to two by accepting payment for the plate along with the licence fee, thus removing the Revenue Commissioners from the loop.</P>
    <P>The new provisions provide that my Department will accept the fee and issue the new transport discs. Transport discs in respect of each licensee will be generated from the computer records of vehicles in my Department and issued directly to the licensee. As each disc is expected to last on a vehicle windscreen for five years it will be made of a durable material. The disc will contain relevant licensing and vehicle details to aid enforcement of the legislation governing licensing. A notable feature of the transport disc regime is that it will apply to the passenger sector for the first time. It has been the policy of the passenger operator associations to have an official regime for plating buses put in place. The new transport disc meets that demand.</P>
    <P>Another significant element of the Bill is contained in section 9 which amends section 36 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, the principal Act, relating to the prohibition on unlicensed haulage. The existing provision provided that it was not lawful for any person to enter into an agreement for the carriage for reward of merchandise by any other person unless that person was licensed. This prohibition has proved less than effective as the proving of an offence could require proof of the existence of a formal written contract between the consignor and the haulier. The provision in the Bill will enable prosecutions to be brought on the basis of advice notes or evidence of the driver or operator. This provision is expected to be effective in the overall fight against unlicensed haulage within the State.</P>
    <P>An opportunity is being availed of in the Bill to address a difficulty that has arisen in relation to one of the CIE salaried superannuation schemes. The legal basis for the existence of the Salaried Officers and Clerks (Great Northern Railway, County Donegal Railway and the Irish Railway Clearing House) Superannuation Scheme, 1977, is currently in doubt because the order enabling it was based on section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, which was repealed without a saver by the Transport (Reorganisation of Córas Iompar Éireann) Act, 1986. Section 18 of the Bill provides a solution to the difficulty by restoring the <i>status quo ante</i> to orders made before the passing of the Transport (Reorganisation of Córas Iompar Éireann) Act, 1986, by deeming them to continue in force as if made under section 25 of that Act. In this way the doubt as to the legal basis of the superannuation scheme will be removed.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other minor provisions of a technical nature such as amendment of section 8 of the Road Transport Act, 1971, as inserted by the Road Transport Act, 1986, to facilitate the appropriate recognition in Ireland for licences, permits or authorisations issued by other states arising out of international agree<Col N="1418" /> ments to which the European Communities is a party, or such authorisations issued by other member states arising out of acts of the European Communities. The updating takes account of liberalisation of haulage markets within the European Union and beyond.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends section 5 of the Road Transport Act, 1978, to include international road transport agreements entered into by the European Communities or any acts of the European Communities. The section provides for the exemption of specified classes of international transport by road from the licensing, transport disc regime and the prohibition on the importation of vehicles provision of the Road Transport Acts. Section 12 creates an offence of falsifying or altering a licence document and of using a falsified or altered licence document for the carriage of goods or passengers for reward. Section 21 provides for an extensive schedule of repeals in order to revoke spent or replaced sections of the many Road Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a significant step forward in road transport operator licensing and, in particular, brings in a very important set of amendments to the Road Traffic Act, 1961. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Second Stage of the Bill gives a timely opportunity to review the current state of the road haulage, road passenger and bus transport industries. We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but we have some serious criticisms of the way the Government is proceeding in both these areas and the lack of affirmative action in dealing with many issues which appear to be stuck in neutral in the Department. There are some welcome minor changes in relation to the administration of road haulage and passenger services.</P>
      <P>On 25 March 1997 this Bill was produced by the Minister's predecessor. We were told it could not be proceeded with because this Minister wanted a bigger and better Bill. The explanation I received was that the question of consignor liability was being dealt with. Section 17 which deals with this matter is one of the most ingenious shams I have ever seen. I will deal with that later. It introduces into Irish law for the first time a blatant out clause, further to representations from IBEC and industry, which nullifies the effect of what we have been waiting for over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The road haulage industry has not got the proper acknowledgement or understanding in the political arena, the media and Irish life in general of its important role. I welcome the review, given that much of the industry is experiencing a hand to mouth existence and is suffering from illegal competition and huge competitive pressures. The erratic nature of the unstructured industry has led to fundamental problems such as the protests at Dublin Port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leadership must be given by the Department in supporting the Irish Road Haulage Association <Col N="1419" /> financially over a set period to get it on its feet. One of the purposes of unionisation is to bring order. I hope the review will favour the orderly development of structures.</P>
    <P>Over 70 per cent of all EU goods are transported by road. Irish industry and the Celtic tiger are dependent on the success of the road haulage sector. We are an island economy and transport costs are about twice the EU average as a proportion of total manufacturing costs. Therefore we must establish our haulage industry on a proper footing. Ireland's exports account for 70 per cent of GDP compared to a figure of 10 per cent in the US. Imports and exports combined account for 140 per cent of GNP. The percentages in terms of road and ro-ro freight are virtually 80 per cent and 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>The IDA should market Ireland as a high speed, cost effective export centre in terms of transport. It is critical that we get that right. Hundreds of heavy goods vehicles are going by ro-ro to the UK or by ferry services to Europe. The contribution of the industry in respect of road tax, PAYE, PRSI, excise duty and VAT on fuel and trucks amounts to literally hundreds of millions of pounds. There are some 140,000 heavy goods vehicles and between 4,500 and 5,000 haulage licences. Some 6,000 trucks per day entering Dublin Port gives a clear profile of the industry.</P>
    <P>The sustaining of the Celtic tiger boom depends on getting haulage right, with a reasonable profit margin. Everything from tax treatment to the enforcement of the law against illegal haulage needs to be put at the centre of the political debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State announced on 1 April 1998 a crackdown on illegal haulage, plans to hit rogue operators within the haulage industry and visitations of premises of transport managers. Perhaps the Minister will let us know the result of the crackdown. There are provisions for penalties of £1,000 on summary conviction. How many people have been convicted of illegal haulage? The allegation by the IRHA is that 20 per cent of haulage is illegal. I would like a progress report.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the French truckers dispute. France accounts for 10 per cent of our total exports or about £3 billion in 1997. This dispute cost hauliers large sums of money. There were claims for some £6 million. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who saw the publicity opportunity was meeting Commissioner Kinnock and so on. What happened since then? Who picked up the Bill? Once the blaze of publicity died down were any claims met? In its representations to the French authorities has the Government obtained any recompense for those who were put out of business?</P>
    <P>I assume the report of the review group will be published. If so, what is the date of publication? I hope it will set out a proper basis for the industry to proceed. The handling of the issue of illegal haulage and enforcement of existing legislation does not inspire confidence as regards ensuring a level playing field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> Section 17 attempts to deal with the issue of consignor liability. The argument is simple. Hauliers bear total responsibility for breaches of the limits of laden weights that can be carried. Frequently the haulier is the victim of pressure by the consignor, whether a gravel pit operator, a person in the construction industry or someone who is putting pressure on margins. I understand the maximum tonnage weight is of the order of 40 tonnes. The gross limit is 38 tonnes, the EU directive stipulates 44 tonnes and the UK figure is 41 tonnes. Given that the EU figure is 44 tonnes, I understand a little leeway is given. Prosecutions are taken against those who have over 44 tonnes. Following the Minister's commitment to the IRHA and receipt of representations from the construction industry and IBEC, to ensure their members would not have to pick up the bill which the IRHA was shunting in their direction and to obviate the need to breach these regulations and thereby release the pressure on the haulier, section 17 was drafted as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (4):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4A) Where a person contravenes subsection (3)(b) of this section and the load or loads were consigned to such person by one consignor alone, that consignor shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>That is what I call consignor liability. We then have the ingenious political stroke which would do &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; proud in any episode:</P>
    <P>(4B) In a prosecution under subsection (4A) of this section it shall be a good defence for the consignor to prove&ndash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>that it was not practicable for the consignor to estimate the laden weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles, or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>that an estimate of the laden weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles carried out by the consignor prior to the dispatch of the goods indicated that the weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles did not exceed the maximum weight laden specified by a regulation under this section applying in relation to the vehicle or combination of vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 of the previous Bill is the parallel reference. That out clause gives the effect of ensuring that the consignor would not be liable. Essentially, that whitewashes the provision. I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to have that reversed because it will be impossible for the DPP or anybody else taking a District, Circuit or High Court case to obtain a successful prosecution and conviction because of that out clause.</P>
      <P>One possible way of dealing with this pragmatically is that it shall, by law, be the case that the gross unladen weight of the vehicle shall be displayed prominently on the vehicle. This would allow a situation whereby there would be no out clause for the person loading the lorry to state that he did not know the weight, as I understand that the defence would be that they did not know the previous unladen weight of the vehicle and, therefore, how would they know if a 30 or 40 tonne load would put it over the limit. The point of the law &ndash; we are making law here &ndash; is to be certain and clear so that a judge in a court can interpret it. This is unclear and unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>On that specific question, it would be unfair if the employees of companies like CRH, which are involved in a great deal of loading of sand, gravel and other building products, were liable under the EU directive on laden weights which comes into effect on 1 January 1999. In some companies a circular has been issued to the staff to the effect that the front line troops, who may be acting under instruction, are liable. In all cases it should be the commercial entity and not the employees who are liable. I want to make it clear that I am not satisfied with section 17.</P>
      <P>A section of the Bill relates to the parking of vehicles and the obligation to provide a space. I am sure every Member of this House from time to time has received representations, particularly from residents in local authority and private housing estates, about the parking of huge 40 foot trucks in densely populated housing estates in the evenings and at weekends. When these complaints are made by residents who literally cannot see out their door because of these monstrous vehicles, local authorities shrug their shoulders and state that it does not require planning permission to park a vehicle there, it is not blocking the road even though it may be a <i>cul de sac</i>, etc. That parking provision should be properly implemented so that people are prevented from parking such unsuitable vehicles in confined spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My greatest criticism and angst about this topic relates to road passenger transport services. If <Col N="1422" /> ever there was a minimalist level of reform of bus passenger services, it is this legislation in terms of the administration of route licensing. I appeal to the Minister to get someone to take political ownership of the time warp of legislation and regulation relating to the licensing of bus passenger services since 1932. I have discussed this at public meetings with Bus Éireann drivers and ICTU people working in CIE groups as well as FOTO, PAMBO and the management of Bus Éireann. Nobody is prepared to defend the current legal framework.</P>
    <P>The situation is analogous to that which existed in independent radio where there were illegal pirate stations and nobody could develop their business. The Independent Radio and Television Commission was created and now there is successful national independent and local radio. It is providing a service which is badly needed and it is properly regulated.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the services which are competing with Bus Éireann on the radial routes to Dublin from Rosslare and Belfast and all points in between, from Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork, Limerick, Tralee, County Kerry, Ennis, Galway, the north-west, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Drogheda, are illegal and unlicensed. They operate under a misnomer of travel clubs and they provide a <i>de facto</i> scheduled service. Those services are illegal and the Minister's Department and the country turn a blind eye to it. All buses are full. I was at the Bus Éireann launch just before Christmas of nine day-return services from Rosslare to Dublin. Ardcavan Coaches provide six or seven return services per day.</P>
    <P>We need to properly license this service. We need to take it out of the hands of the Department of Public Enterprise because obviously there is an inherent conflict in being the sole shareholder of CIE and the licensing authority. The position, the policy and the law is clear. Where anybody, be it a private operator or Bus Éireann, has an existing licence, nobody else can get a licence. This must apply with the implementation of the EU directive on cabotage <i>vis-à-vis</i> road passenger services from next June. Leaving aside the fact that Europe is obliging us to do this, we need the orderly development of bus passenger transport services. With the advent of public service contracts, it is necessary to develop new transport services, commuter links and orbital routes. Perhaps there is a need for a service from Tuam to Mountbellew.</P>
    <P>A new transport licensing commission, like the Independent Radio and Television Commission, should be set up under legislation with a board of ten persons. I am quite happy for CIE and all the vested interests, including the consumer, to be represented on the board and the commission should have a chief executive. I am not talking about the UK example of the mid-1980s whereby there was a free for all, everybody went on particular routes, there was huge attrition, fares were slashed, companies went bust and in some cases there was less public transport. I am talking about <Col N="1423" /> the orderly development of the service, assessing the provision and recognising the need. In some cases there is no service in rural areas. Many people have one car only and the main bread winner uses it for work. How do people transport themselves? What about the drink driving regulations? Buses which are on school bus runs in the morning and evening and are idle for the rest of the day could be better used.</P>
    <P>There is the question of telematics. In Finland, for example, with the implementation of the EU directives and the SAMPO programme, they have developed telematics where there is modal shift ticket information and computerised databases. If one wants to go from Enniscorthy to Enniscrone, these systems give information on how one might do so through public transport. Ticket sales systems have been integrated in tourist information offices. There is a need for orderly development over a five year period &ndash; I would be happy to write off CIE's debts &ndash; a crackdown on cowboy operators, minimum standards in terms of seating arrangements, insurance obligations, company law and tax compliance. It would suit the illegal operators to have a level playing field. There should also be a rolling subsidy as it is sometimes necessary to kick start a new service to make commuters aware of its existence. It would not be impossible, therefore, to design a blueprint but nothing is happening.</P>
    <P>I am not representing any interest group. I am considering the needs of consumers &ndash; students, pensioners and so on. The use of bus lanes and the free travel pass on all licensed services falls to be considered as part of an integrated transport policy. As in the case of independent local radio, someone will have to be told to devise such a policy. The Finnish model is the best in terms of being fair to everybody in what is an important industry.</P>
    <P>There are huge economic benefits to be gained in encouraging commuters to use public transport. The lack of such a service in rural areas is a factor in social exclusion. The area partnerships have done much work in pioneering new services. While hackneys which are expensive are better than nothing, there is no scheduled minibus service in my constituency worth talking about. I am not out to screw anybody; I wish to ensure a fully integrated public transport service is provided. Existing services need to be regulated. Local Bus Éireann managers have informed me that there is cut-throat competition from unlicensed operators. One can obtain a day return ticket from Cork or Wexford for £10 which is exceptional value.</P>
    <P>It was my hope that the Minister of State would have said that, while the legislation does not deal with route licences, it is the intention to introduce major reforming legislation. It is my experience that, if given clear instructions, civil servants are the best in the world. There is, therefore, a need for political direction. If necessary, consultants should be appointed to advise on the best route <Col N="1424" /> to take. Something has to be done as we are not being fair to compliant operators or commuters dependent on public transport.</P>
    <P>To monitor compliance with road haulage legislation, I understand a triangular symbol is on display on vehicles. I also understand that if one is carrying a load for one's own purposes, one is exempt. The introduction of transport discs will level the playing field.</P>
    <P>We dealt comprehensively with the matter of enforcement measures on Committee Stage of the Carriage of Dangerous Substances by Road Bill. I am satisfied that, as a result, it will not be possible to leave the jurisdiction while on bail. I cite as an example the case of the Italian in the Minister of State's constituency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although I am not happy with section 17 which deals with liability. What is the current position on the review groups, support for the Irish Road Hauliers Association, a specific structure to allow the industry to grow, the French dispute and the crackdown announced last April? I deplore the absence of a policy initiative, not to mention legislative proposals for reform of the bus transport sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to welcome the Bill which differs in two respects from the Bill I published during the term of office of the previous Government with the full approval of the then Minister, Deputy Yates. It provides for the introduction of five year renewable licences and &ndash; this is a major change &ndash; seeks to deal with out of State hauliers. I attempted to do this but despite my best efforts and those of my officials we failed to come up with a wording that would satisfy the Attorney General's office from which we received no positive assistance. It was a major omission.</P>
      <P>I am not certain why the Minister of State wishes to alter the current system of permanent licences with provision for review, to one of five year renewable licences. We can tease out the reasons on Committee Stage. We should seek to avoid bureauracy. The introduction of a disc as opposed to plating will be welcomed by the Irish Road Hauliers Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of State hauliers are a source of great angst among Irish road hauliers. It is the responsibility of the Garda Síochána to monitor breaches of the legislation. When an out of State operator thunders down the road, the gardaí must wave him on because he is exempt from the law. This is an extraordinary situation. Out of State hauliers operating here are effectively exempt from the law because a summons cannot be served on them. Regulations regarding tachographs, weight limits and a range of non-arrestable offences do not apply to them. They can undercut Irish operators because they enjoy all the benefits of non-compliance with the law. A very simple wording has been found to deal with this problem. Where a driver cannot give an address at which a summons can be served, he can be arrested and held, either on bail <Col N="1425" /> or on remand, until he can be brought to court. The amount required for bail in such cases is not specified in the Bill but it should be an amount equivalent to the maximum fine for the offence in question. Of course, if the driver is not convicted subsequently he will get his money back.</P>
    <P>The problem of out of State drivers is not confined to the road haulage area. Four million tourists come to Ireland every year. They too are exempt from our laws unless their offence is one for which they can be arrested and detained until their case comes to court. They certainly may park wherever they like. The worst they can expect is a parking ticket if they are outside Dublin and they can drop that into the nearest litter bin, assuming they do not wish to litter the streets and break another law. Even if they did so they would not be liable to punishment for that offence either.</P>
    <P>The area of consignor liability is very important. Given the number of road hauliers who are owners of only one or two lorries it is important that a consignor who insists on placing an excessive load on a lorry should be legally liable for the excess weight rather than the driver or owner of the lorry. The law as proposed is very good. It may be that it can be improved. Nothing that has been invented is incapable of improvement and I look forward to hearing some gems of wisdom from my Fine Gael colleague on Committee Stage. There are many difficulties in the area of consignor liability. For example, where there are two or more consignors, perhaps five farmers consigning one ton of potatoes each, it is not clear who is liable for the consignment. Situations such as this had to be provided for.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cement companies &ndash; I will be no more specific than that &ndash; who have contracts with their hauliers which oblige them to carry excessive weight on every load. Very few of the cement companies own their own lorries. They insist on owner-drivers. When the drivers are caught with an excess load they are liable as drivers and owners. If drivers do not accept these contracts which oblige them to take excessive loads they get no more work. It is high time that cement and gravel companies in particular were held liable for overloading the lorries which carry their goods. That will be to the benefit of the road haulage system in general. I agree entirely with what the Minister said about damage to roads, road safety and damage to vehicles. The cement companies do not care about damage to the owners' lorries. An owner will often spend Saturday and Sunday under his lorry repairing the damage caused by overloading and trying to keep his vehicle on the road. I am pleased with this measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision regarding parking of lorries. If someone who has only one lorry is to get a licence for road haulage he should have a place to park it. A haulier who has 20 lorries should have a place to park them also. That should be a condition of the road haulage licence. Lorries should not be parked outside their driv<Col N="1426" /> ers' doors. It is now legally possible for local authorities to introduce by-laws excluding commercial vehicles from any housing estate or indeed from any area. Many local authorities have implemented that law. They have certainly done so in parts of my constituency. This measure was badly needed and is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The extension of the distance within which lorry drivers can be brought to a weighbridge is a badly needed measure which is long overdue. Lorries have been using rat-runs around minor roads to keep outside the maximum distance from weighbridges. That was a regular feature in County Kildare. Lorry drivers avoided weighbridges by using back roads and did very serious damage to roads which were not designed to carry heavy vehicles with large loads. It will now be possible for gardaí to bring lorries a distance of 15 miles to a weighbridge. That should cover almost the entire country. If it does not, there is a need to provide sufficient weighbridges to do so.</P>
    <P>I find myself in the strange position of almost making a Second Stage speech in support of the Bill. I was directly involved in drafting most of what has been presented to the House. Well done, to the Minister for finding the formula which I failed to find and for finding parliamentary time to introduce the Bill. I will be supporting the Bill wholeheartedly and I will be glad to support any improvements which can be made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for the Minister to create a regime where lorry drivers and hauliers are more likely than not to be caught if they break the law, whether with regard to tachographs, excess weight or any other matter. We need a degree of enforcement which creates a level playing field for those who comply with the law. The Minister must increase the number of inspectors in his Department. While those inspectors need to be fully versed in this area, there must also be training courses for gardaí to ensure they are fully familiar with the very technical regulations regarding tachographs and other matters.</P>
    <P>We must press, at European level, for a tachograph system that is tamper proof. The Minister, his Department, the Garda and I know all the tricks available to drivers to ensure that tachographs do not tell the true story. When drivers cross borders they often throw out the old tachograph and replace it with a new one. These abuses can be dealt with by the electronic tachograph which is proposed at European level. I understand the system is being held up because the Germans and French disagree as to which of them will manufacture the electronic equipment. The introduction of the electronic tachograph is very much in the interest of drivers who are being obliged by lorry owners and by those who hire them to drive in excess of the legal number of hours. This is creating a time bomb which could go off at any moment. It is more serious than drinking and driving, particularly at the levels that now apply to drinking and driving. It is more <Col N="1427" /> dangerous that people exceed, and grossly exceed in some cases, the tacograph limits and the hours they are allowed to operate. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State on getting it into the House. While it was a long time in gestation, it improves on the Bill we approved in the last Administration, and it has my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the introduction of this Bill. It updates transport legislation and is urgently needed. I am pleased the new legislation is set out in readable and understandable language. That should be the pattern for all such legislation. It covers all operator licensing requirements and procedures as laid down in European Union legislation. It will bring us into line with the main EU directives which lay down conditions for issuing licences to international haulage operators and to national and international passenger operators.</P>
      <P>The new law will specify that a transport licensing disc be used instead of the present haulier's plate. There will be a change in the duration of licences. Under the 1986 Act a licence covered a three year period while the new period specified is five years, although the Bill states the Minister may issue licences for a shorter period at his discretion. This will apply where operators do not meet requisite criteria, but are likely to meet the standards in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Following the enactment of section 3, the Minister may declare, by order, that a licence granted by a competent authority of another State which is party to EU or international agreements, may be deemed a restricted road freight licence and it may continue in force. He will have the power to amend or remove any orders made under that section. The penalties relating to tampering with licences will be heavier. Any person who alters or permits the alteration of a licensing document or engages in the transport of goods by road while in possession of such a document will be subject to the imposition of stiff penalties. That is as it should be and I support this provision.</P>
      <P>This Bill will enable us to bring prosecutions against out of State hauliers or bus operators as well as Irish operators who do not conform to its provisions. The powers of the Garda have been widened to ensure they can now arrest without warrant, out of State operators who have broken the law. The gardaí may do this if they have reason to believe the offenders may not be available for the service of a summons. This aspect of law enforcement has given rise to many time consuming problems. It has caused deep resentment among those engaged in the road haulage industry to find that out of State operators may break the law here and leave on the next ferry and never be seen or heard of again. It has often proved impossible to establish a satisfactory address to serve a summons on such persons. Section 13(2) specifies what is regarded as a satisfactory address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> Persons who employ unlicensed hauliers will be liable to prosecution under the terms of section 9. Under existing provisions there is an onus to prove that an agreement existed between the consignor and the unlicensed haulier, but that will not be the case under the terms of the Bill. I am pleased this loophole has been closed. Currently the driver and the owner, if the owner is not the driver, of a licensed vehicle are liable in the case of overweight vehicle offences. Under the new Bill a third category is added whereby the consignor of the load may be prosecuted in the case of overladen heavy goods vehicles. This will ensure a drastic change in the attitude of some consignors. It will guarantee that the consignor carefully weighs and notes the contents of loads in containers loaded on to consignee vehicles. Up to now they could not be held liable for such an offence. Responsibility will continue to rest with operators in receipt of such loads. They must also monitor loads. They must ensure that the combined weights of containers and vehicles meet the legal specifications. Under law the drivers of all vehicles requiring a weight check will be compelled to travel up to 25 kilometres to a weighbridge compared to the previous requirement of five miles.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifies that adequate parking must be provided by operators for all vehicles that operate under licence from their premises. A person who holds a licence on the day preceding the introduction of that section does not have to comply with the new parking regulation until three years after the expiration of the current licence.</P>
    <P>There is also a welcome change in the licensing procedures. The initiative to centralise the issuing of licence plates under the sole control of the Department of Public Enterprise is commended. This enlightened approach is to be expected from the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob. It will be a vast improvement on the old system, which involved a cumbersome and outmoded process involving several Departments. The Minister has created a new offence concerning the falsification of licensing documents. Under the terms relating to this offence, a designated licensing document will be deemed a public document. They will come under the terms of the 1913 Forgery Act.</P>
    <P>The introduction of on-the-spot fines which will be payable immediately for certain road transport offences is another positive move. It has been welcomed by bodies in the transport industry. They expressed concern that there must be full implementation of the Bill in the area of enforcement. The new measures will be assured of success, if there is a will to enforce them. The determination must exist at all levels in Government, in the Department of Public Enterprise and in the ranks of the Garda. I assume the increasing demand this will place on Garda time will be taken into account. We are all aware the Garda have many other existing and pressing priorities. I presume that additional resources will be put in place. I know the Department of Public Enterprise will ensure that the necessary <Col N="1429" /> resources to implement the new laws will be made available.</P>
    <P>The wide-ranging changes proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, can only have a beneficial impact on road transport here. The current gross vehicle weights permitted need to be reviewed and brought into line with UK and EU averages. The permitted gross vehicle weight of a two-axle tractor unit and a tri-axle trailer is 38 tonnes while in the UK and Europe it is slightly higher. A two-axle commercial tractor unit with a two-axle trailer has a permitted gross vehicle weight of 32 tonnes. The average permitted unladen weights of a tractor unit and flat trailer is 11 tonnes, a tractor and curtain side is 12 tonnes and tractor and fridge unit is 17 tonnes. Who will be responsible in the case where a consignor loads more than the permitted maximum weight on to a vehicle? Other Members raised this point earlier. If 24 tonnes of meat were loaded into a fridge unit and, given that the maximum permitted unladen weight of a tractor and fridge unit is 17 tonnes, this would mean that the combined weight of the vehicle and trailer would be 41 tonnes, 3 tonnes over the permitted gross vehicle weight. Would the haulier or the consignor be responsible in the case of such an offence? That needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Is the onus on consignors to ensure vehicles and containers are weighed before they leave their premises? If a 40 foot container arrives at Dublin Docks or Cork Docks and the goods in a container are heavier than the weight displayed on the outside of the container, is the haulier responsible, given that he does not load the container. If a fridge unit were to contain 24 tonnes or 26 tonnes, that would make a haulier's vehicle three or four tonnes over the permitted gross vehicle weight. The Bill must be clear about this and about the directions that should be taken in the case of such offences.</P>
    <P>I understand from hauliers that quite a number of 20 foot or 40 foot containers coming into this country may weigh more than the weight displayed on the side of the container or they may be heavier than what the vehicle is allowed to carry because heavier weights are permitted to be carried in Europe.  Will there be weighing systems in ports to weigh trucks leaving the port, to ensure they are not over the gross vehicle weight?</P>
    <P>The haulage industry needs to look very carefully at its organisation and operation. I was involved in the sale of commercial vehicles from 1975 to 1985. I sold a truck to a haulier for £15,000 or £16,000 in 1976; that same truck would cost about £50,000 or £60,000 today. However, haulage rates have not changed very much in those 20 years. The haulage industry needs to look at its operation, put in place a code of practice, get the proper rates for its members and be systematic in its pricing and charges, so that hauliers can make a profit and do not have to work outside the law in order to make ends meet. The industry must examine that very carefully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> Vehicle manufacturers have made great strides in vehicle development over the past 20 years, with the introduction of electronics, computers, speed limiters, air braking systems and semi and automatic transmissions. However, it is time for them to consider manufacturing on-board weighing systems for vehicles, to assist hauliers. There are so many devices in trucks nowadays that it might be possible to develop a weighing system which could be set for the unladen weight, whereby when the truck, container or fridge is loaded, the haulier can see the exact weight. This would greatly assist hauliers, the law and the Minister in ensuring the law is obeyed. I hope the Minister will see some merit in this proposal and that his officials will write to the vehicle manufacturers &ndash; the few that are left in the world &ndash; and suggest this to them. I will also raise the matter with them, as someone who is in that trade.</P>
    <P>I have noticed recently, as I hope the Minister has, the number of vehicles registered as off highway vehicles, such as tractors, which are on the highway. These vehicles are doing the job of trucks and tractor units with three or four axles which are licensed for certain highway work and are manufactured to very high safety standards. I worry about the use of off highway vehicles. For example, many high horsepower agricultural tractors are being used in the carriage of beet. It is extremely dangerous to have vehicles which are not manufactured to high safety standards, in terms of braking, steering and carrying capacity, on the main roads. An increasing number of these vehicles are used whether on construction sites or drawing beet from Cork to the beet factory in Mallow.</P>
    <P>The Minister should deal with this very serious issue, if he is not already doing so, in the interests of public safety on our roads. An agricultural tractor could not have an air braking system which would be capable of stopping at the required distance, in the same way as a commercial vehicle would be expected to do. This has been a cause of concern to me over recent months. More importantly, the Garda is also extremely worried about this type of vehicle operating on our main roads. If there is a loophole in the law which prevents the Garda removing these vehicles as unsafe vehicles, I ask the Minister or the Department of the Environment and Local Government to examine this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which I will be supporting on Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Teastaíonn uaim an Bille a phlé i gcomhthéacs níos leithne ná mar a bhí luaith cheana féin. Dúirt an tAire nach féidir leis an mBille dul i ngleic le gach rud ata tábhachtach agus glacaim leis sin. Ach tá sé an-thábhachtach é a chur i gcomhthéacs chomh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill, particularly given the importance which transport has assumed, both in terms of its economic value and public concern about the spiralling growth in transport, particularly transport by road. Deputy Yates said <Col N="1431" /> that 70 per cent of goods now travel by road. We can expect that figure to grow, given the Government's policy which favours road construction above investment in public transport, particularly railways which have been an important part of freight transport for many years. It was also mentioned that 6,000 trucks go to Dublin Port everyday, which has knock-on effects. The Bill does not come to terms with the drastic action that would be needed to prevent that becoming a problem.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years, in this and other countries, transport has taken over from industry as the largest user of energy in the economy. The fact that we are living in a free market economy that spans the world explains, to some extent, why that is a global trend. There is a claim that this is somehow inevitable due to economic growth. However, I would have to argue against that, based on the facts. For example, while GDP in the UK in the years 1974-90 rose by 38 per cent, energy growth rose by 5 per cent. Therefore, it is possible, with intelligence and a sense of what is sustainable, to ensure that traffic and energy growth are not necessarily linked to economic growth. The challenge facing this or any Government is to try to decouple economic growth from increasing consumption, particularly in the energy sector, of which transport is a large part. Growth in road transport is unsustainable given the way it is currently operating. We can continue to say the economy is doing well and that economic growth means there will be a continuing growth in transportation. However, if it is unsustainable then the economy is not doing well and is heading for a cataclysmic meltdown. That has to be faced. For this reason the Greens are extremely enthusiastic about building up local economies, not just for the sake of community development which is a human factor, but because of the need to ensure that energy usage is minimised and kept at sustainable levels. That is not happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>Many things can be done that are not mentioned in the Bill. The freight and commercial vehicle sector needs to rationalise deliveries and that is something in which the State must play a part. We need to ensure that resources are maximised as a priority.</P>
    <P>Targets need to be set because without them we are simply talking in empty terms about traffic reduction. Hong Kong has managed to establish a target of reducing traffic by 25 per cent. That is a set target which is politically decided and enforced through the legislature. It is something we have not faced up to. The Greens have published a Traffic Reduction Bill which was tabled in the House of Commons through an arrangement with the Green Party in the UK, even though it does not have representation at Westminster.</P>
    <P>There is a need to enforce standards. Those that currently operate are not being enforced, in addition to which they are inadequate. That fact <Col N="1432" /> has come to my notice time and again through constituency work in Dublin North. People within the industry have complained to me about the lack of enforcement of standards. I will talk more about that later.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a need to take a wider look at avoiding heavy traffic in our cities and towns. A number of bypasses have been constructed, including the Balbriggan bypass which has helped greatly to avoid road casualties. On Dublin City Council the Green Party proposed that a marshalling yard ought to be built on the western perimeter of Dublin and that freight should be brought in using the rail line to Dublin Port to minimise the current level of 6,000 trucks per day using the port. Unfortunately, that idea did not find favour with the city fathers and the Government, even though it was supported by private industry and business interests. We have now been left trying to grapple with huge problems such as financial commitments, community resistance and environmental problems as well as the lack of feasibility of the port tunnel and the spectre of the eastern bypass which has again been raised.</P>
    <P>There has been a lack of vision in the transport area. It is time to address the matter before it is too late. Government policy has to be examined in terms of our links with the European Union and the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99, which indicates where the Government's priorities lie. As things stand in the programme, £1,655 million will be allocated to roads whereas rail will be allocated £275 million. That is a clear statement of priority by the Government as to where it wants to see development taking place. The effects of that have to be lived with.</P>
    <P>With 63 per cent going to roads and 10.5 per cent going to rail, it is obvious that rail freight is not a priority for the Government, regardless of what might be said. Private companies and semi-State ones have seen the writing on the wall. An Post has stopped using rail in favour of road transport. If that company, with links to the State, is doing it, one can imagine that private industry will certainly not try to do the decent thing and uphold the common good by taking transport off the road, if it can avoid it, when it does not see support from the State for such a policy. The State has not shown leadership and our children will have to live with the consequences.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes a number of provisions which are welcome in themselves, notwithstanding the Government's dismal record on sustainability in the transport sector. Extending the licence to five years and its renewal thereafter will I hope be strictly enforced. I also hope adequate standards will ensure that individual smaller freight companies will not be subject to the kind of competition we currently see on the roads. Those working in the sector talk about this freely.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Stagg mentioned, there is huge pressure on drivers resulting in tiredness and, thus, danger to other road users. Delivery deadlines can pose a problem. Recently, a man came <Col N="1433" /> in to see me who had been sacked from his job as a truck driver. His dedication to basic standards had resulted in his refusing to travel at a certain speed. In addition, he would not drive a lorry that had not been properly maintained because he was not prepared to put himself and other road users in danger. However, his employers were put to the pin of their collar to meet deadlines. They felt that if he was not prepared to obey their orders he could go and they would hire somebody else. I was distressed to hear that he was given his marching orders.</P>
    <P>This enormous pressure in the industry can only be dealt with by the proper enforcement of standards. We have gone too far in the area of competitiveness, through Maastricht and our operation in the Single Market, to say that there is any room for manoeuvre in the area of competition where the law of the jungle applies. However, standards have to be enforced if the habit of speeding and lack of adherence to other traffic regulations is to be broken. If one company gets away with it, another will be equally unscrupulous to stay in business. That view can only be changed through proper enforcement. Vehicles are being hacked by what employers see as a need to cut costs and, literally, cut corners.</P>
    <P>There is a crackdown by the Government, as Deputy Yates mentioned, and I am keen to know what progress has been made. I suspect that people would not come to me complaining they had been fired for insisting on basic standards in vehicles if a proper crackdown was taking place.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned a disc regime for passenger vehicles. The MOT test will now, belatedly, become practice in Ireland. The MOT certificate should be clearly displayed on vehicles, as well as insurance and tax discs. I am working on a report on behalf of the Committee on Education and Science on passenger transport, and school buses are considered substandard. Pupils, parents and schools feel they are getting the dregs of the bus fleet. It would reassure people if they could see where and when the last MOT test was carried out. If any questions arise, they could be directed at those who should be in a position to answer them. At present, only a verbal assurance is given by bus companies, including Bus Éireann, that an MOT test is in order. The proof is not visible and people cannot see the details unless they make a nuisance of themselves and seek copies.</P>
    <P>The MOT test is inadequate. The test for passenger vehicles deals with the mechanical state of the vehicle, including checks on the brakes and other essential aspects. However, the MOT test does not cover issues such as proper seating, floors, leaking fumes, leaking windows or roofs in disrepair. It does not ensure these matters are rectified. The impression is given that substandard vehicles are used for passengers. This matter must be tightened up and I hope this aspect will be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction by the Department of regulations to allow bus lanes to be used by <Col N="1434" /> private passenger transport operators. However, further consideration should be given to allowing emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, fire brigade appliances and others, to use the lanes. The Blue Cross cat protection society does not have many vehicles and is not responsible for congestion. It is a small player with a humanitarian cause. In terms of the proper consideration of traffic and road transport issues, it should be possible to extend the use of the lanes to such vehicles. I make this appeal on behalf of the cat protection society which has been directed from office to office in trying to find out who is responsible and who can make a decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the need for a parking scheme. In my constituency of Dublin North, many housing estates are plagued by the lack of parking schemes for commercial vehicles. This does not only relate to the dangers associated with large, articulated vehicles parking in housing estates, although the safety aspect is a huge consideration because children are fascinated by large vehicles. Drivers of other vehicles get no warning as children run under the wheels of articulated vehicles and out onto roads.</P>
    <P>Refrigeration units running during the night are also an enormous problem. In some cases, they cause blockages to the emergency services and bin lorries trying to enter estates. The problem has been exacerbated by the lack of parking facilities for heavy goods vehicles. Some measures have been taken to alleviate the difficulties but given the huge growth in heavy traffic, the rules and regulations must keep pace. Finance or an incentive must be provided to ensure that secure parking facilities are available.</P>
    <P>The extension of the five to 25 kilometre distance in which lorries may be directed to a weighbridge is critical. Although Deputy O'Flynn said the weight on Irish roads is less than in other countries, many of our roads cannot take it. Part of the reason is that many roads are poorly drained. The water lodges, the roads fall into disrepair and they are easily broken up by heavy vehicles. Another problem is the poor enforcement of speed limits. The Garda is doing all it can, but consideration must be given to this matter. Unfortunately, a few examples must be made before the culture of speeding changes.</P>
    <P>The change which will allow the Garda to seize non-Irish vehicles is long overdue. I welcome it, but I ask the Minister to state when the regulations to make that provision operable will be introduced. Provisions in other legislation have been put on the long finger and promises were made but no regulations were introduced. Enforcement requires the introduction of regulations. I ask the Minister to give a timeframe, such as six months, so we know when regulations will be introduced and people in non-Irish vehicles can be held to account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and the positive moves being made by the Minister in relation to the administration of the licensing <Col N="1435" /> system. The Minister said that a study is ongoing and that consultants were appointed in July 1998. Given all the matters raised in this debate, it should be crystal clear that there is a need for the final consultants' report to be brought forward at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>This legislation and various Bills introduced previously have added to the problems experienced by road haulage operators. The other side of the equation has not been addressed. The overall development of the road haulage system, including containerised road haulage, general road haulage and the breaking of bulk haulage when it arrives in Ireland before it is distributed by hauliers, has been neglected. There is a need for a national policy. At present the direction of policy is driven by the market rather than the State.</P>
      <P>The day of haulage being conducted through the rail network has gone. The demand in the market is for a haulage system that will deliver products and goods to the door just on time. This just in time concept includes couriers with small vans and has extended to the supply of goods to manufacturing units throughout the country. It has also placed demands on manufacturers who supply products internationally. They are supplying those markets on the basis of the just in time concept. This concept has placed phenomenal pressure on manufacturers and the road haulage system generally. In order to ensure goods are delivered to the market, undoubtedly in an emergency, manufacturers or suppliers will use an unlicensed cowboy operator just as quickly as a licensed courier or a road haulage operator. This concept must be addressed by the consultants engaged by the Department. I hope that in bringing forward plans for a road haulage system servicing the ports and the rest of the marketplace, all aspects of the market will be examined. I believe the Department will be amazed at the number of unlicensed operators. Those operators pressurise their staff to meet deadlines in order to retain a contract. That deadline may be met by breaking the tachograph, speed or weight regulations.</P>
      <P>If we recognise the existence of unlicensed operators and if consultants are in place, it is time for the Department to adopt a more proactive role in conjunction with the Irish Road Haulage Association to ensure a code of practice is drawn up for hauliers, be they single operators or medium to large sized companies. We cannot wait for the publication of a consultants' report before we take action. Road haulage is operating in a pressurised environment and additional problems are caused by allowing cowboy couriers to operate within the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the code of practice could also address the rates system. A person coming into the market who has perhaps been made redundant and purchases a truck ends up competing with a legitimate company on the rates issue. The market controls the rates, not the Irish Road Haulage <Col N="1436" /> Association. Hauliers are operating under pressure because of the rates issue, the looseness of the current legislation and the manner in which it is policed.</P>
    <P>International haulage operations have also been affected. Recent incidents in France, the UK and Spain indicate that the stated concepts of the European Union are not being adhered to. We have seen how militant French operators can be and how they brought the entire industry to a halt. When French operators went on strike, the Irish freight industry came to a standstill. Drivers were parked on French roads and were unable to move. The cost of such action to Irish road hauliers was enormous. A package was put in place for hauliers to access some sort of compensation. However, the level of administration was unacceptable given that 75 per cent of operators run small enterprises in which the main person in the business often drives the truck. As an island on the periphery of Europe, we need a strong, well supported and efficient haulage system. That is imperative if we are to build a sound economy for the manufacturing and service industry.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this issue is being addressed by consultants. Will the Minister inform us when their report will be available and when we will have an opportunity to debate its findings? I would be critical of the Irish Road Haulage Association input into this area. The association should be more proactive and put in place a sensible code of practice and rates structure.</P>
    <P>The displacement of jobs in the haulage industry was referred to and is relevant to my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny. During the recent beet campaign, farmers driving high powered tractors took on the haulage of beet to the factories to the point where hauliers were excluded or, at the very least, had their proportion of the business drastically reduced. The business of hauliers who had families to support was jeopardised in that instance. That was unacceptable and it clearly indicates that the rules laid down in legislation are not being policed.</P>
    <P>Those who break the law are not being followed up but those who operate within the system can be followed up easily because they hold licences and conduct their business from particular locations. That is not possible with cowboy operators who enter and exit the trade willy-nilly, leaving a trail of destruction in the marketplace and a rates system which cannot guarantee the future viability of the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that haulage licences are to run for five years instead of three. The level of administration and time involved in the old system meant that the operator or some employee spent too much time dealing with administration rather than the running of the business or seeking new business. They were obliged to communicate with the Department, go to their local Garda stations, deal with the Revenue Commissioners and so on. The one-stop-shop approach is an excellent idea. I believe the Irish Road Haulage Association will favour this change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> The fact that illegal hauliers will now be certified and made accountable through this legislation is a welcome development. Prosecutions in this area would represent tangible evidence that the legislation will operate for the overall benefit of the haulage industry. For too long, businesses which employ unlicensed couriers or transport operators have dictated the speed and weight of trucks and the type of delivery. Licensed operators lost out if they were unable to match the terms offered. I hope this legislation, if it is properly policed, will ensure compliance by businesses which currently use unlicensed operators.</P>
    <P>The condition of premises is another cost factor in the development of haulage businesses. I welcome the suggestion that the condition of premises would be policed, but it is important that those who do not observe requirements in this area should be heavily penalised. Departmental officials should be able to examine tachographs, haulage licences, the make of truck and the premises to ensure companies comply with the legislation.</P>
    <P>Housing estates are pestered by vehicles of one kind or another which are leaking diesel and are a source of nuisance, annoyance and danger to people. The sooner they are taken out of housing estates the better. This regulation, if enforced, will ensure that operators, big or small, will have somewhere other than a housing estate to park a vehicle, tractor unit or trailer. It will ensure greater health and safety in the workplace and greater security for people who operate legitimate haulage companies. I therefore welcome that development.</P>
    <P>Making prosecution of out of state hauliers easier is another aspect of this legislation which is to be welcomed. I have been a member of a local authority for many years, and in Kilkenny the main complaint, given the narrow medieval streets in that city, relates to out of state hauliers making deliveries in the high streets completely disregarding local authority parking attendants and the Garda Síochána. They park willy-nilly, deliver their goods and drive away. I hope this legislation will prevent that the future. It is down to policing the measure. We should allocate sufficient funding and an adequate number of people on the ground to ensure that this aspect of the legislation is enforced in inner cities and towns.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent idea to encourage truck manufacturers to incorporate a mechanism to check the weights being carried. I do not believe it would add greatly to the cost of a truck which can be up to £100,000. Current technology should enable the monitoring of weights being carried by vehicles. That would assist operators and drivers because, regardless of legislation, there is always someone who wants to put an extra kilo or an extra tonne on a truck that is already overloaded. If there is shared responsibility and the driver can point to a piece of technological equipment in his cab to support his assertion that his truck is <Col N="1438" /> becoming overloaded, it would be well worth the investment.</P>
    <P>The use of tachocharts would also be worth investing in. Even with the new green engines in larger vehicles there is still a need to develop the tachochart regulations and tachograph use. Currently the controlling feature in a cab that prevents a driver from driving over the speed limit can be bypassed. It is down to the manufacturers to do something about that. We should be proactive in this area through national Government or through the EU and insist on the incorporation of a weighing mechanism in trucks and the use of tachographs which might perhaps have a memory that would give a read-out of speeds being driven. In addition, it should not be possible for an irresponsible driver who simply wants to speed across our roads to tamper with the governor that governs the speed of the truck . Given that there is a problem nationally of excess weight being carried by trucks and that tachographs can be interfered with, it is no wonder accidents are caused by speed. It is beyond me how a truck carrying 30 tonnes or in excess of that can be stopped at 70 or 80 miles an hour without causing damage.</P>
    <P>Given the weight of European legislation and now national legislation, there is a need for training in this industry of management, office staff, warehouse staff and drivers. Every member of staff in a haulage operation should be familiar with the day-to-day running of the company in the context of the legislation of the day. Even members of the Irish Road Hauliers Association are not aware of all the legislation. There is a need to bring everyone in the industry up to speed, and this should be paid for by the State or jointly by the State and the industry. There is a need for ongoing education so that people working in the haulage industry are aware of how, on a daily basis, they can be brought to the point of breaking the law and what to do about it.</P>
    <P>We dealt with legislation on the transport of chemicals in this House recently, but how well is it being policed? What sort of take-up is there of relevant courses? There is a need for serious investment by the State in training in the haulage industry. Such training should not be confined to the transport of chemicals but should run right across the board of management and staff and deal with every aspect of the industry. If we embark on such a process we will be doing the road haulage industry, its future viability and future operators a great favour. I encourage the Minister to go down that road and commend him for bringing this legislation to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Given the difficulties being experienced by the industry and hauliers in general because of increased competition from Europe, I was expecting a more detailed and comprehensive Bill. It is important to ensure a level playing pitch for all hauliers in the new liberalised haulage market that has been introduced <Col N="1439" /> on foot of EU directives. Notwithstanding the various reports &ndash; I refer particularly to the Forfás Transport and Logistics Group report published in 1996 &ndash; once again consultants have been drawn in. Given the shortage of finance for the elderly, education, housing and so on I am amazed that there always seems to be millions of pounds for consultants' reports. I sincerely hope this course of action is not being taken by the Minister or departmental officials as a delaying tactic prior to bringing in the legislation that is required.</P>
      <P>The key provisions of the Bill relate to regulations governing the issuing of licences for road freight haulage and road passenger operations. Licences will be issued for a period of five years subject to requalification procedures and I welcome that. The existing licensing provisions under the various Road Transport Acts will be repealed and all operator licensing requirements will be set out in new regulations made in accordance with EU legislation.</P>
      <P>I am also very pleased that the current cumbersome vehicle plating procedure will be replaced with a streamlined system of transport discs involving the Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>An important provision in this Bill is that licensed operators will be obliged to have adequate parking spaces and operating premises for their vehicles. I hope this will bring an end to parking lorries and buses while not in use on the streets of towns and cities. The unacceptable practice of parking heavy lorries and buses on streets, in housing estates and in villages at night will also be eliminated.</P>
      <P>The parking of heavy vehicles and buses in residential housing estates has become a major problem for thousands of householders. Housing estates are not suitable locations for parking such vehicles. It is a dangerous practice and many accidents have occurred when young children have run out or cycled a bicycle from behind a parked bus or truck into on-coming traffic. This has long-term effects on the children and their families. Although in most cases the drivers of the vehicles are not responsible this does not take away from their trauma and guilt in the aftermath of an accident.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted and clearly stated that it is totally unacceptable that people who pay £130,000 or £140,000 for their dream home or first home should have to look out their front windows at these heavy vehicles across the street. I hope this Bill will help the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government made regulations under the Road Traffic Regulations 1997 which came into effect on 1 October 1997, dealing with parking vehicles in estates. There are a number of pilot schemes in operation in Fingal and from my experience there are many shortcomings with these regulations, the most significant being that the restric<Col N="1440" /> tion on heavy goods vehicles parking in one area transfers the problem to adjoining estates.</P>
    <P>On the other hand people come to me saying they work 80 hours per week, drive to the Continent, that driving a heavy vehicle is their only job and asking what they can do when there is no area for parking. This might be a legitimate concern, but we must look at the overall picture. It must clearly be said that providing parking areas in residential estates is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Currently most county development plans are being concluded, and I hope they will incorporate the necessary land and zoning of areas to facilitate local small entrepreneurs who see a niche in the market for the provision of adequate secure parking areas. Alternatively it may be possible to have joint ventures between local authorities, individuals and small businesses in the provision of parking areas. Drivers living in residential areas cannot be asked to move six or seven miles away to an unsupervised parking area. There is a major role to be played by local authorities, the Department and relevant personnel in the industry and I hope these come together to see how this very important issue can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure parallel legislation is introduced requiring local authorities to provide proper passenger pick up and set down places in towns and villages, including modern proper shelters and passenger information. The legislation could set out a procedure whereby this could be done in conjunction with bus operators who should pay for the service provided.</P>
    <P>Earlier I spoke about the necessity of having a level playing pitch in the context of the industry and such legislation. In the past there may not have been a level playing pitch in the context of private versus public transport operators. In many cases it was said that parking was overlooked for private operators and that the standards of maintenance required for public transport vehicles was inferior to that required for private operators. In many ways this has changed. Irrespective of liberalisation, etc., we must ensure the public is provided with the best quality buses available, that the same standard is applied across the board and that people not adhering to it are penalised.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that parking and traffic regulations are fully enforced to free up the movement of traffic through the streets of towns and villages. The current almost explosive increase in the number of vehicles on our roads has made this a priority issue. The Minister should also consider the introduction of reserve lanes in selected locations outside the greater Dublin area for buses, taxis and emergency services. These are becoming necessary to improve the poor performance of public transport on our increasingly congested roads. Outside bigger cities it may be possible to allow lorries to use these lanes also. The enforcement of parking and use restrictions in such areas would have to be a priority.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the retrospective reinstatement of orders made under the Trans<Col N="1441" /> port Act, 1950, which had become legally doubtful because of the subsequent 1986 legislation. This has been an ongoing issue, and I compliment the Minister on incorporating this matter into this section of the Bill. However, I will refer to another aspect, namely, the amalgamation of the various salary and superannuation schemes. Currently there are approximately 2,200 contributing members to the schemes &ndash; I think there are four schemes &ndash; and about 1,400 pensioners of the various CIE salary pension schemes.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, for the past four to five years there have been ongoing negotiations between the unions and CIE with a view to amalgamating the schemes and funds. The staff have been waiting for five years for improved pension benefits arising from restructuring and amalgamation of their superannuation schemes which has been agreed with CIE. This proposal has been agreed with the Department of Public Enterprise, and the Department of Finance has also supported this agreement, but there are some difficulties with the Attorney General's office. This is not good enough and must be resolved.</P>
    <P>I had hoped there would be provisions in the Bill for the amalgamation of the superannuation schemes, and the Minister may clarify the situation when he replies to Second Stage. Given that it is not provided for in the Bill as it stands, it is my intention and that of the Labour Party to table an amendment on Committee and Report Stages. Superannuation schemes, particularly the 1951 scheme, can operate successfully if the funds are there. There are plenty of funds in this case and the scheme would be beneficial to all. Having considered this matter, I hope the Minister will table the necessary amendment to tidy up the Bill and meet the requirements of the members of CIE and pensioners in line with the agreement entered into by the unions and the company.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings about many improvements which I hope will enhance and improve the industry. As I said earlier, given the competition not only from within the country but from elsewhere, more legislation is required to which I look forward. I also look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on an amendment to the superannuation scheme when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Ryan's concerns about the forthcoming consultants' report. I hope the report is not looked upon or sought as a cause or an excuse for further delay and a failure on the part of the Department or the Government to innovate and move ahead in a proactive manner in the area of road transport and bring forward vital legislation which is obviously required to tidy up the industry and make it better, not only in terms of the safe carriage of goods but also from the point of view of the more efficient operation of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a vital area and the House is very lucky, of which I am sure the Minister and Deputy Ryan <Col N="1442" /> are aware, that my colleague, Deputy McGuinness, has a vast amount of experience in this area. I was very struck by the picture he painted of the industry and, indeed, by the depth of knowledge he demonstrated in his speech. Deputy McGuinness and his family have run a very successful and reputable transport firm in Kilkenny for many years, so I very much defer to his sense of knowledge and understanding of what is required in an industry such as the transport industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation the Minister has brought forward but do so with a sense of caution because I was very struck by what Deputy McGuinness said. He portrayed a very disturbing picture of an industry in which there are a huge number of cowboy operators and where manufacturers and suppliers resort to using these cowboys out of a sense of desperation. There does not seem to be proper sanctions to deal with them. This legislation is a welcome step towards the elimination of these cowboy operators in the transport business. They are a menace to the reputable operator, the roads and the smooth running and proper functioning of our economy. I am glad the Minister is dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>An aspect of Deputy McGuinness's speech which was very striking was the use of the term which has become very familiar in the area of management theory and management practice which have developed since the 1950s, that is the concept of just in time production and delivery perfected by the Japanese in their manufacturing processes. As we all know &ndash; the Minister is more acquainted with this than anyone else &ndash; in recent years the just in time concept has permeated every aspect of industry. It has combined with the introduction of information technology, computerisation and better communication generally. The effect has been to revolutionise the area of logistics. It is very noticeable throughout Europe and the global trading market that companies are more and more seeking higher profits by perfecting their logistical operations, how they deliver goods to the market, within what timeframe and at what speed. Central to that for many manufacturers and suppliers is the whole idea of having an efficient distribution and transport system which ensures that there is not a build-up of inventories or stock in warehouses.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee on which I serve, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Employment, are witnessing a complete move to centralised distribution in the retail and supermarket sector. That has very important consequences for roads and transport. Given the small size of our country we must perfect our transport system so it dovetails with that of our neighbours in the UK as well as with continental systems.</P>
    <P>There will be a shake out in this industry over the medium to longer-term. It is hoped that shake out will occur in an orderly manner which is well policed and regulated by the State and in a way which is to the advantage of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> We must wait for the consultants' report and I hope it is produced quickly. I am sure the Minister will enlighten us on that point later, but it is important the report is produced speedily and that the Minister is proactive in this area, as he has been, in my experience, to date. It is important that he shows this proactive side to his nature again and, if necessary, moves ahead of the consultants' report if he sees he can be of influence in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness mentioned the need for a code of practice for the industry, which would be welcome. The Minister can show some leadership in this regard by bringing the industry, including the Irish road hauliers, together to insist this code of practice is brought in so the industry gets rid of its poor image. I am worried by Deputy McGuinness's comments on the chemical industry. He seemed to express doubt, concern and worry, and justifiably so, about the carriage of chemical products. The Minister may wish to address, when summing up, the looseness in the current legislation and the fact we are adding to it bit by bit rather than producing consolidated legislation which assists this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a welcome contribution to the debate which shows he understands his brief and is on top of his job. I am sure he is only too willing to move ahead. The fact that 75 per cent of this sector comprises one to two man operators is an issue of huge concern. This is a small country and 60 or 70 per cent of Irish businesses are small, but it is disturbing that a vital national resource like the transport infrastructure is dominated by one or two person operations.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to parking in suburban estates. If the Minister could do something about that matter, it would be very helpful to me in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities are well aware of the need to have arrangements in place designed to prevent large sums of money failing into the hands of criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The security arrangements to be made in any such instance are matters to be determined by the <Col N="1444" /> Garda authorities on the basis of their professional judgment, deploying to maximum effect the resources at their disposal. The Deputy will appreciate that, for obvious reasons, there are limits regarding the level of detail concerning such arrangements on which I can comment publicly.</P>
    <P>There are and always will be, situations where the professional judgments made by the gardaí or indeed any other professionals may be queried on various grounds when something goes seriously wrong. This is essentially what the Deputy is doing and that is understandable.</P>
    <P>I have confirmed with the Garda authorities that their cash escort policies are kept under constant review and, in line with standard practice, there is a further review of existing arrangements ongoing following the robbery in Dalkey. Obviously, the fact that lives were threatened by the criminals who carried out the robbery is and has to be a source of concern and underlines the importance of taking the lessons of Dalkey on board as a matter of top priority.</P>
    <P>In looking at the Dalkey robbery generally, it is right to acknowledge on the positive side that the general arrangements the gardaí had in place were such that the raiders, although having the benefit of selecting the location and the timing of their attack, were forced, due to the speedy arrival of the gardaí, to flee the scene with considerably less cash than was in the security van.</P>
    <P>On the question whether there is evidence that the raiders had paramilitary connections I am informed by the Garda authorities that at this stage of the Garda investigation into the robbery, no conclusions have been reached by the investigating gardaí regarding the involvement of any specific subversive or criminal group. Recent suggestions to the effect that the gardaí or the Government are seeking to suppress knowledge of Provisional IRA involvement in this robbery are without foundation.</P>
    <P>Like all Members of the House, I condemn what was clearly a well planned and ruthless act of armed robbery during which shots were fired, including one at the driver of the hijacked car. Such incidents cannot and will not be tolerated. The priorities of the Garda authorities now will be to secure the necessary evidence to mount a successful prosecution against the perpetrators of this outrageous crime, and, as in other cases, ensure that the lessons to be learned from the crime are taken fully on board in determining their crime fighting strategies.</P>

        <b>: </b>Why has the Minister chosen not to make a statement but rather to hide behind the guise that this is an operational matter for the Garda Síochána? Does the Minister not recall that in January 1995, when the same company was involved, he insisted on the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, making a detailed statement and answering questions in the House? She did not cling to the type of political cowardice that has been the hallmark of this Minister. Will the Minister confirm that this was a para<Col N="1445" /> military operation, that Garda communications were intercepted, that AK47 guns, which are the stock and trade of the Provisional IRA, were used, that shots were fired, that £80,000 was taken and remains missing &ndash; that would buy quite a number of rocket launchers and Semtex &ndash; and that the raiders are still at large? Will he acknowledge that everybody, including the Garda and the general public, knows that this was a paramilitary raid? It had all the hallmarks of a paramilitary raid and should be acknowledged as such.</P>

      <P>Political cowardice is not something I could be accused of with any great reason. I well recall January 1995 and on that occasion I raised several issues with the then Minister. Those matters related, for example, to the urgency with which the question of the freezing of assets should be dealt with by the Minister of the day. I spoke also about the need to implement the 1994 Act and the need for a bail referendum and referred generally to matters of policy. I want to make it clear that I have no difficulty coming into this House at any time to answer reasonable questions Deputies wish to raise. The Deputy is being disingenuous when he accuses me of doing otherwise in this case&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to whether this offence was carried out by the Provisional IRA, the Continuity IRA or other paramilitaries, the position is that at this stage of the Garda investigation into the robbery, no conclusions have been reached by the Garda regarding the activities, in so far as involvement in this crime was concerned, of any specific subversive or criminal group. It has not been the practice for a Minister of the day to report to the House on the progress of Garda investigations, nor indeed did the previous Minister for Justice do so. It would not be proper for me to speculate as to who were the perpetrators of this crime. I emphasise that recent claims that the Garda or the Government are trying to suppress information in this matter, and trying to suppress knowledge of Provisional IRA involvement, are totally without foundation and border on the irresponsible.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Minister not acknowledge that where AK47s are used &ndash; they were used in this case and were the weapons used in the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe &ndash; there is paramilitary involvement? There is a seepage of guns from the IRA so this was either a Provisional IRA or a dissident IRA group and the Minister should admit that. Will the Minister explain the reason a security van with £1.2 million on board was travelling unprotected in south County Dublin? The van did not have a Garda or <Col N="1446" /> Army escort and to allow that van travel the roads unprotected was a major security blunder. Whose decision was it not to seek armed protection? What guidelines are in place for the shipment of such large amounts of cash? Has the Minister ordered a full security review? In view of the fact that there was interception of Garda communications, is the Minister now prepared to introduce legislation to ban scanners? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation to ban scanners would not be effective. I have sought and obtained Government approval to the tune of £80 million to replace the existing Garda radio network to ensure we can have encryption which will mean that it will not be possible for people planning crimes of this nature to listen in to what gardaí are saying to one another. That is an effective response and, in general terms, the gardaí welcome that move.</P>
      <P>Schedules are supplied to a Garda liaison officer by the cash in transit companies in relation to movements of cash by them. On 4 January 1999, the Garda Síochána were aware of 72 cash in transit vehicles operating in the Dublin region. A specific request for escort was not received in respect of the vehicle in question. However, the Garda monitoring plan took into consideration the movement of the vehicle together with the other cash transit vehicles. Monitoring of these vehicles by members of the Garda Síochána is scheduled to afford the maximum coverage possible to each movement. The Garda Síochána decides where the escort should go on a given day. It is regrettable that an escort was not provided on this occasion and I do not defend that. However, I outlined to the Deputy the precise position on the date in question. The situation is monitored and there are ongoing discussions within the Garda Síochána regarding the issue of security.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the legislation, which I intend to introduce arising from the High Court decision to which the Deputy refers, will be to restore the power to deport, a power which is a necessary part of the sovereignty of the State. The legislation will not deal with permission to work for asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> Regarding race relations, the Deputy may recall that, in 1997, my Department established a national committee to co-ordinate the European Year Against Racism. Through this committee, the Department progressed a programme throughout 1997 which focused on several racism themes and which involved initiatives at national and local level. In July 1998 I established a National Consultative Committee on Racism and lnterculturalism. The committee is a partnership of Government Departments, agencies and non-governmental organisations. The objective of the committee is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against racism and to advise the Government on matters relating to racism. The committee will also endeavour to promote a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of minority groups, including asylum seekers. As part of its programme the committee will encourage and support initiatives from organisations and groups at local and regional level involved in activities including the promotion of public awareness and education in the area of race relations.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Refugee Act, I have indicated to the House on several occasions that I am of the view that the Refugee Act in its current form is unworkable for a number of reasons. The Act and its procedures were designed to process approximately 300 to 400 applications per year. However, we have experienced an enormous growth in the number of asylum seekers with more than 4,600 applications recorded last year. The Act only provided for the appointment of one Refugee Applications Commissioner and one Appeal Board with no powers of delegation.</P>
    <P>I am now reviewing the 1996 Refugee Act in the light of other EU member states' refugee legislation and having regard to the considerable experience subsequently gained in my Department in the operation of the refugee determination procedures over recent years. The review of the Refugee Act will include a review of the nature of the Determination Authority, with a view to establishing the most appropriate arrangement for determining asylum applications given the volume of applications for refugee status being received in this country. I cannot give the Deputy a precise timescale for completion of my review, but she can be assured that there will be no undue delay in the matter.</P>

      <P>On the question of the right to work, the Tánaiste has announced the intention of the Government to introduce some right to work for asylum seekers. We have not received any detailed information about that nor a response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the matter. What are the Government's plans regarding the granting of a right to work to asylum seekers? The suggestion is that it is centred purely on employers rather than on asylum seekers. Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1448" /> would say if this permission to work is likely to be sufficiently extensive to make a difference to the lives of the many asylum seekers who have been in Ireland for more than six months and who have been seeking a right to work, something they would have in Britain.</P>
      <P>Regarding the legislation which I understand we will debate next week, we have all received letters from Amnesty International expressing concern that many people who have been deported or are awaiting deportation have not had access either to legal aid or interpretation. Is it the Minister's intention to take on board this point in the legislation? Perhaps he could give me the up to date position regarding legal aid for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Refugee Act, the Minister says it is unworkable but it was enacted by the House, so there is an onus on him to at least attempt to make it workable. Amending it in terms of the delegation of the powers of the commissioner is a relatively simple operation.</P>

      <P>The answer to the fifth and last question is that it has not been published. The right to work is an issue the Deputy raised at the outset. The Government has not made a decision that asylum seekers should be allowed to work. However, there is nothing to prevent a person making an application from abroad to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for a work permit. Approximately 17,000 applications have been approved over the past two to two and a half years. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has operated to a large extent as a rubber stamp in approving such applications.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about legal representation for asylum seekers and I have made arrangements for it to be provided to them from this month. Until now, they were entitled to employ a solicitor. I originally became involved in a tendering process to see if the private sector could be involved, but I was strongly advised, having received a number of tenders, that it would be best to proceed through the Legal Aid Board, and I am now doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Refugee Act was passed by the House, the previous Government chose not to implement it because of a court challenge to a portion of it. That was not the only reason. Another reason is that it would not be possible <Col N="1449" /> at this stage to operate the provisions of the Act because only one commissioner and one appeals commissioner is provided for. In 1995 there was a small number of applications for asylum. In 1998 there were approximately 4,600. No one could suggest that one commissioner and one appeals commissioner would be in a position to deal with that level of applications.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Refugee Act, 1996, is inoperable in so far as it relates to the processing of asylum applications and must be amended. I am now actively considering amending the Act and I intend to bring forward proposals to the House to make appropriate amendments so that the legislation can be implemented. In this context, I stress that the Dublin Convention provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, have been signed by me into law. A considerable amount of criticism has been levelled at me and the Government by the Opposition regarding the asylum issue over a protracted period.

      <P>There has been a considerable amount of public debate on whether asylum seekers should have the right to work. I have heard few, if any, politicians from any side suggest that an asylum seeker should have the right to work if the application is processed within a period of six months. When I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I inherited <Col N="1450" /> utter chaos in this area. There were thousands of applications which had not been dealt with for years. In some cases people had applied four or five years ago and had got no response from the Department. Some 20 officials were trying to deal with thousands of applications. Today 150 officials are dealing with these applications. There are two appeals authorities and I will appoint two further appeals authorities in the not too distant future. I am reaching a stage where I will deal with all applications within a period of six months. I hope to have the backlog, which built up under the rainbow coalition, cleared by the middle of 2000. On the question of the right to work, is Deputy O'Sullivan saying that applicants for asylum, having arrived in the State, should immediately be given the right to work or should a period elapse? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred and three sex offenders were released from prison in 1998 and a further 68 offenders are scheduled for release in 1999. It is the policy that periods of temporary release or early release are not granted to persons serving sentences for sex offences save in the most exceptional circumstances. Sex offenders may be released on full completion of their sentences &ndash; allowing for standard remission at 25 per cent &ndash; or by order of a court following a review or successful appeal.</P>
      <P>The sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison can cater for up to ten offenders at any one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies. This programme is not confined to those in custody in Arbour Hill Prison. All convicted sex offenders, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the programme. Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are found to be suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all sex offenders are encouraged to avail of treatment, they cannot be compelled to attend, nor do they receive extra concessions for attending. One to one counselling is also provided by my Department's clinical psychology service and the Probation and Welfare Service. In <Col N="1451" /> addition, a new non-therapeutic programme for offenders, The Thinking Skills Training Programme, was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork prisons during 1998. A significant number of sex offenders have commenced this new programme.</P>
    <P>I am keen to increase the number of group treatment places available for sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is examining the possibility of locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh place of detention.</P>
    <P>Sex offending is an issue of understandable public concern and one to which a comprehensive response is warranted. While I am determined to expand the prison treatment programme, action will be required on other points also, which is why I had a paper published by my Department last May on sexual offending. That paper covers a number of issues which will have to be addressed as part of the comprehensive response I am pursuing. I am referring here to matters such as the creation of a sex offenders register, to which I am committed, and other legal options. The various responses to the paper, which have been received from the public, have been under consideration in my Department and I hope very soon to begin bringing specific proposals to Government.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister accept that to release 68 sex offenders back into society, the majority of whom are untreated, is a dereliction of duty and sheer criminal neglect? The Minister and I know this is the group that is most likely to offend. At least with treatment and therapy there is some hope they may mend their ways. Given that the Minister has promised this enhanced programme for some considerable period, why is treatment not made universally available to all prisoners? Why is it not compulsory? What advance procedures are in place for the release of sex offenders from the point of view of trying to normalise their return to society? Are victims notified in advance of the impending release of persons who have committed sex offences against them?</P>

      <P>There is no provision whereby people are informed that an individual is being released. That is an issue that has to be <Col N="1452" /> addressed in the context of a new charter for victims of crime. It is a matter to which I am giving due consideration.</P>
      <P>On the question of treatment for sex offenders, any person who is suitable and volunteers will receive treatment in an Irish prison before his release. The problem is not everybody is found to be suitable and not everybody volunteers. There are instances where people volunteer and are found not to be suitable. It has been argued that it should be made compulsory, but I am strongly advised that compulsory treatment of sex offenders is not an advisable option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I have indicated that it is my intention in the not too distant future to introduce a sex offenders register. This is not as easy a task as it might appear to some, including Deputy Neville, as would appear from comments attributed to him in various media reports. There are a number of issues which must be determined and most of them are quite complex. Not least of these is who should be on the register. Should it just be paedophiles or should it be all sex offenders? Who should have access to the register? Who should maintain the register? For how long should the register contain the name or names of individuals? My preference at this point is to introduce a register not just for paedophiles but also in respect of sex offenders who are guilty of serious sexual offences. It is my intention to bring forward that register as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I received the report on sexual offences last year and it contained a considerable amount of debate on this and other issues. It will ultimately lead to a comprehensive Bill dealing with the range of sexual offences because the time has come for us to modernise our laws to reflect the tragic reality in society today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms. O'Sullivan Ms. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there an attempt to encourage sex offenders in prison to volunteer for treatment? Are they interviewed? Is the seriousness of their crime pointed out to them? In other words, is it left to them to volunteer or is a proactive attempt made to encourage them to get involved in programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat it is not possible to compel sex offenders in custody to undergo treatment and I am advised it is not desirable to do so. I am sure the Deputy will accept that the successful completion of any group treatment course depends critically on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals. Otherwise the elements of the programme concerned with challenging the offender to take responsibility for his offending behaviour simply will not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> At present, offenders who have completed their sentences cannot be compelled to accept supervision from the Probation and Welfare Service or, indeed, to partake in any specific treatment programme. There are, however, 96 offenders under supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service on foot of court orders.</P>
    <P>I stated that we have completed a document on sex offences. This discussion paper deals with a variety of issues and it is under consideration by the Department, but my strong advice is that I should not attempt to compulsorily require offenders in prison to undergo treatment. Suitability and self-motivated voluntary participation are essential ingredients to the success of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has admitted that a considerable number of sex offenders are released from prison without the benefit of any form of therapy or treatment, does he consider it prudent in the context of such releases that consideration should be given to placing a restriction on the movement of such persons, with particular reference to ensuring that they do not live in close proximity to victims of their acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is not my policy to give any sex offender early release from prison. In those circumstances the only entitlement of an offender would be to the ordinary remission. The question then is how we would ensure that the individual, despite having been released, would remain under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. That poses a difficulty in that while I would have control to a certain extent of a prisoner, for example, released under the temporary or early release regime, I would not have control of other prisoners who are released . The question then arises whether there should be a system of imposition of a determinate sentence with the latter portion of it being suspended to enable the supervision of the individual to take place. There is, as Deputy Flanagan more than most will be aware, a legal problem in supervising an individual who has obtained full release.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is there any indication from the Garda Síochána that there is a relationship between the release of untreated sex offenders and the massive increase in child abductions, about which there is much concern?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of whether a person is on a register in the UK, that would not necessarily restrict that individual from leaving that jurisdiction for a temporary period. However, the issue of whether this jurisdiction <Col N="1454" /> should insist upon a person who is registered in Britain registering here is obviously something which will be carefully and favourably considered in the context of the introduction of a register here. I am informed that the movement of such people, when it comes to the attention of the police in Great Britain, is transmitted immediately to the Garda Síochána so that they too will be aware of the movements of the individual in question.</P>

      <P>The reality is that the Minister does not have the relevant information. In 1998 the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation's money laundering unit received more than 1,200 reports of suspicious transactions involving in excess of £123 million. The Minister does not know how many persons were involved and how many were charged and convicted. I assume he will extend the relevant legislation, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to provide for mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions by accountants, solicitors and auctioneers, when the figures will mushroom considerably, or can this be done by regulation? Will he undertake to provide the unit with sufficient manpower and resources to allow reports of fraud to be investigated thoroughly not only by the unit but by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts? </P>

      <P>It is not the practice to give detailed information about an individual Garda investigation or operation except in singular instances where the circumstances are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the armed robbery in question, which occurred only ten days ago, is still the subject of a full and detailed investigation. I understand a number of armed raiders entered the bank at approximately 5.40 p.m. when the bank was closed. Staff were still on the premises and the raiders escaped with a quantity of cash and cheques. The description of the getaway vehicle, a red Mitsubishi jeep, was carried in the media. I appeal to anyone who has information on the robbery to contact the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As the House will appreciate, I cannot comment further on the details of the robbery at this stage but the Garda Síochána has been effective in reducing the number of armed robberies in recent years.</P>

        <b>: </b>There were two major bank raids in the first month of the year. Does this instil confidence in the public? A sum of £1.2 million was taken in Dalkey.

      <P>The opposition I furnished my predecessor was extremely constructive. It led to the enactment of several Bills, not least the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I asked my predecessor to deal with in 1995. Although serious offences have been committed, the public can be more than confident about the current position. Garda statistics show a consistent drop in the number of armed raids under my stewardship. The number recorded in 1997 was 48 per cent lower than the number recorded the previous year and only one third of the number recorded in 1993. The detection rate has also improved from 26 per cent in 1993 to 34 per cent in 1997. I do not have the 1998 statistics but I understand the provisional statistics show a continuation of this trend with a 9 per cent drop. I congratulate the Garda Commissioner on these excellent results. The Deputy's lack of magnanimity in acknowledging my role should not cloud his ability to extend a semblance of generosity to the Garda Commissioner. That is the least we should expect from him, irrespective of his thirst for revenge.</P>

Has there been a <Col N="1457" /> change of policy since the previous Administration when every file contained supplementary information, including statistics and percentages? Every contingency was covered. Does the Minister not acknowledge that his last reply to a supplementary question stands on its head his assertion that he does not have statistics? He has rhymed off a list of statistics in relation to the percentage drop during his term as Minster. He spoke of 40 per cent of this and 30 per cent of that. In view of the fact that the Minister gave us percentages, what is the actual drop in the number of armed robberies in 1997 and 1998 compared with previous years? Can the Minister also acknowledge the fact that big bandits are back in business. There was a drop in serious crime and bank raids had virtually ceased. However, in the space of a year we have had three major bank robberies &ndash; in Ashford which, thankfully, was thwarted by the Garda Síochána, in Dalkey where £1.2 million was taken, £80,000 has not been recovered and the bank robbers are still at large, and now Ardkeen where guns were used and £100,000 was taken and the raiders escaped. The detection rate is not very impressive. Can the Minister give us the precise figures?</P>

Deputy Higgins is well aware that it has never been and will never be the practice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speculate on the identity of those who might have been involved. It would be contrary to long standing practice, and to the public interest, if anything were said in the House which might disclose the extent of Garda intelligence in relation to the activities or the capabilities of serious criminals or subversives.

      <P>In the first instance, the position with regard to the contract is that it was entered into by my predecessor and a number of other parties. Under the terms of the contract in question, Esat Digifone was allowed to enter into certain exempted sites and to put its antennae on Garda masts. This meant that very often local communities were not in a position to voice any <Col N="1460" /> objections which they might have had. This is a cause of concern in communities which do not want these antennae put on masts in their localities. The contract is a binding agreement made between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Esat Digifone and a number of other parties. It must be clear the contract cannot be set aside by anybody unilaterally. It would require the written consent of the parties to the contract to change it and I have not said otherwise. The contract is extant. Discussions on Kerrykeel and a number of other matters are continuing. In that context, it is a commercial contract and, as with all such contracts, it is possible for parties to try to renegotiate their positions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1998 I established a committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community. The committee, which is chaired by my Department, is representative of traveller interests, each of the four pillars in Partnership 2000 and relevant Departments. In addition to monitoring and co-ordinating the implementation of the task force recommendations, the committee will serve as a forum for consultation on current issues of national importance affecting the travelling community. Since its establishment the committee has met on four occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the task force included a number of recommendations concerning the introduction of legislation prohibiting discrimination against travellers. Discrimination against travellers is an issue which is of particular concern to my Department. A revised Employment Equality Bill was enacted in June 1998 and when it comes into operation, it will protect travellers as well as other groups from discrimination in the work<Col N="1463" /> place. Revised equal status legislation is currently being developed and I envisage the Bill will be published before the Dáil resumes after the Easter recess. The proposed Bill will prohibit non-workplace discrimination on a number of grounds, including membership of the travelling community. The Bill will protect travellers from discrimination in the non-employment areas such as education, provision of goods and services and accommodation.</P>
    <P>As part of its terms of reference, the monitoring committee is required to draw up and submit to Government from time to time, starting in 1999, a progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force including proposals for acceleration or prioritisation of implementation of recommendations. I intend to present the first progress report on the implementation of the recommendations to the Government before the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Employment Equality Act and the proposed Equal Status Bill. He indicated to me yesterday that the Employment Equality Act would not be enforced until later this year. Could he be more specific about what he means by &ldquo;later this year&ldquo;? If he publishes the Equal Status Bill at Easter, as he has just suggested, can we expect it to be implemented in a much faster timeframe than was the Employment Equality Act?</P>
      <P>There was a proposal that there should be 3,100 accommodation units of various types for travellers by 2000. Is that aim on course? I hope the Minister will not tell me I am asking for statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to be discourteous to Deputy O'Sullivan. However, the position in relation to accommodation for travellers is not a matter for me but for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I will convey the Deputy's concerns to him and ask him to respond to her.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act is, however, my responsibility. Its implementation ran into a number of housekeeping problems, not least of which was the question of acquiring a premises at a very difficult time in the Dublin property market. I have now happily succeeded through the Office of Public Works, which I thank sincerely, in obtaining a premises at Clonmel Place, off Harcourt Street. I hope to house the Employment Equality Agency and the Director of Equality Investigations there, so that we can have a one-stop-shop dealing with the entire spectrum.</P>
      <P>I have approval for additional staff. I envisage it will take approximately 40 additional staff to get it up and running properly. I also hope to appoint the Employment Equality Agency designate before National Women's Day. I hope I will be in a position to ensure this very important legislation is implemented by early summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Equal Status <Col N="1464" /> Bill was not given the same level of in-depth consideration by the Supreme Court as was the Employment Equality Bill, which was struck down on three specific constitutional grounds. It was accepted, by logical extension, that the Equal Status Bill was also unconstitutional. However, because it was not considered in-depth by the court, it was necessary for the very industrious and able officials in my Department to look in very close detail at the Bill as it had been drafted by the then Minister, Mervyn Taylor, to see what substantive changes were required in order that we would have a Bill which would stand the constitutional test.</P>
    <P>I am confident we will be in a position in the near future to introduce this legislation. I am also confident, subject to the vagaries of what goes on in this and the Upper House, that we will be in a position to have that legislation passed this year.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me, given that I was asked the question by Deputy O'Sullivan, not to acknowledge the tremendous work done by my predecessor, the former Deputy Mervyn Taylor, when he was the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume there will not be the same kind of housekeeping problems with the implementation of the Equal Status Bill after it is published, as happened with the other Bill. Perhaps I did not exactly follow what the Minister said &ndash; is it expected that it will be implemented quickly after it is passed by the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage the same number of housekeeping problems which I ran into with the Employment Equality Act. This will be greatly helped by the fact that the Director of Equality Investigation will be responsible for the implementation of that Act, as well as for the Employment Equality Act.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that people who are dependent on these two extremely important pieces of legislation are desperately anxious for them to be implemented. I am very conscious of that and I assure the Deputy the delay has not been through any lack of effort or urgency on my part or that of the Government, nor will it be in regard to the Equal Status Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there should be a serious examination of why a rift has developed between the travelling and settled communities over the past 20 or 30 years? Twenty or 30 years ago travellers were welcomed into communities and were known personally. A serious rift has come between the travelling and settled communities, which engenders mistrust and sometimes fear. Does the Minister agree there should be a careful examination of why that happened? Putting in structures will not heal that type of rift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that travellers' rights should be protected and that discrimination should be eliminated. However, with that comes a responsibility <Col N="1465" /> for travellers to respect the values and norms of the settled community, and to ensure that members of the travelling community do not behave in such a way as to impact on the lives and enjoyment of settled communities, as they sometimes do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Neville that there appears to have been a deterioration in the relationship between travellers and the settled community. I can recall, from my young days, very happy relationships between the travelling and settled communities at school and elsewhere. That is not to say that has been entirely obviated &ndash; there are certain schools, places and people who maintain very good relations with the traveller community. However, it appears there has been a rift over the past 30 years or so.</P>
      <P>In that context, the task force on the travelling community recommended 12 proposals on how relationships might be improved between the traveller and settled communities. The monitoring committee which I have set up is looking at those 12 proposals to see how they might be best implemented. It is my heartfelt wish that, arising out of the work which is being done, we will see a vastly improved relationship between the traveller and settled communities.</P>

      <P>In replying to the debate on Second Stage I would like to thank Deputies for their thoughtful and helpful contributions. I will endeavour to respond to the many useful suggestions that have been made. We will have an opportunity to examine further the provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A number of colleagues referred to the review of the road haulage sector, which is currently nearing completion. There was quite a welcome for that much needed review. We are coming to the end of nearly six months work which involved a most thorough examination of the haulage industry and, just as importantly, the needs of its customers. The review has also carried out an exhaustive benchmarking exercise with countries such as Holland and the United Kingdom, which have strong haulage industries. The success of the haulage sector in Northern Ireland was also looked at. All in all it is a most comprehensive exercise and will be vital in putting in place a framework for the future development of the sector. As I indicated earlier, to proceed to make decisions without the back up of this detailed and comprehensive review would have been quite wasteful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members, including Deputies Yates and Stagg, raised points to which I would <Col N="1467" /> like to refer. Members raised many important and relevant issues concerning the structure of the sector. I was particularly impressed by the contribution of Deputy McGuinness in this regard. A number of operators skirt the law in their operations. I am hopeful that the review will address many of the issues mentioned by those Deputies. I adverted to most of those issues in my opening speech.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of getting into the area of speculation on what the consultants will recommend. Suffice to say that the consultants are completely independent and work with the assistance of a review group which consists of experts from a wide range of interests in the industry. I anticipate that the report will be available soon and I will be going to Government, first, for approval to publish and, second, for sanction for the implementation of recommendations which fall within my ambit and for the financial and human resources required for such implementation.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that some of the recommendations will require legislation. I assure colleagues that I will return to the House as soon as possible with measures which require statutory backing. In the meantime, I would stress that there are many good provisions in the Bill and that we should move quickly to implement them. Many of the measures were also the policy of the last Government and, therefore, it should not prove difficult for colleagues on the Opposition benches to support the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised the issue of consignor liability as set out in section 17 of the Bill. First, I would like to confirm that this provision was in the Road Transport Bill, 1997. There are two savers in the provision. The first saver deals with a consignor against whom a prosecution is brought under section 17. If there was no saver his defence in court would likely be that he was unable to estimate the weight of the load. The effect of the saver is to place the onus on the consignor to prove that it was not practicable to estimate the laden weight of the vehicle. This provision makes it difficult for a consignor to plead that he could not estimate the load unless he genuinely could not do so. A number of colleagues welcomed that new measure of ensuring consignor liability, along with the liabilities on the other parties which have been obtaining.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates, Deputy Stagg and others raised the crack down on illegal haulage last year. They referred to a very successful campaign waged by my Department in the course of the last year, aimed at transport and quality managers in businesses that employ haulage. We wrote to named individuals in 500 top firms advising them of their statutory obligations in employing hauliers. It is an offence for firms to employ illegal hauliers. The exercise was very successful. Many firms began checking haulage licences and checking with my Department concerning their obligations. We had a very encouraging response and <Col N="1468" /> we will be embarking on similar campaigns in the future.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Yates raised the issue of illegal haulage. I am aware that the IRHA has stated that illegal haulage is at 20 per cent. In their work on the roadside, my Department's transport officers find that the figure is nowhere near that. Because of the difference between my Department and the IRHA about this issue, and in order to ascertain what the real figure is, we have specifically asked the consultants to carry out research on this issue and get a true figure of the situation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies also asked whether it is intended to publish the review of the sector. I can confirm that it is intended to do so and I will endeavour to have the review published before Easter.</P>
    <P>The matter of compensation claims during the French dispute was raised. A firm of solicitors with transport expertise was employed by the IRHA to process the claims and this was certainly the correct approach. A sample of the best supported claims were submitted to the French. Sums of money in compensation were paid to a number of hauliers last year. I made representations in that regard to the French Minister for Transport and the EU Transport Commissioner, Neil Kinnock. The outcome has not been totally satisfactory, or anything approaching that. It is a very difficult area and I hope there will not be a need for such claims in the future. The fact that payment was effected was a start. It meant the issue was addressed and there was a recognition that the hauliers had been inconvenienced. It is a difficult area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the current statutory regime governing road passenger issues. As I said at the outset, the Bill deals with operating licences and not route licences. There has been substantial competition between public and private operators which has been of real benefit to consumers. As outlined in the Department's strategy statement, it is planned to carry out a review of options for the effective regulation of the bus market with a view to introducing legislation to replace the antiquated 1932 Act. The review will focus on improving customer service, effective enforcement, fair competition and appropriate integration of services.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for his support for and gracious comments about the Bill. While it is similar to the Bill which the Deputy and his officials introduced when he was in Government &ndash; they did much excellent work &ndash; there are a number of improvements. It is good that has been recognised. Deputy Stagg asked about the change in policy leading to the granting of licences of five year duration. The Deputy was not pleased with that innovation but the 1997 Bill proposed that licences should be granted for an indefinite duration.</P>
    <P>The change in policy has been heavily influenced by an amending directive which has been <Col N="1469" /> adopted to harmonise the laws and regulations on access to the profession. The new directive requires member states to check once every five years the access criteria, which include good repute, financial standing and professional competence. It is also believed that the discipline on operators being required to pass the criteria every five years is a positive move. As I said, this policy change has been discussed and agreed with the representative associations.</P>
    <P>I thank the other Members who contributed, including Deputies O'Flynn, Sargent, Seán Ryan, Conor Lenihan and the main spokespersons Deputies Yates and Stagg. Deputy Ryan raised the question of legal difficulties with CIE pensions, some of which are dealt with in section 18. There are two sets of legal difficulties associated with CIE superannuation schemes which have been under examination in the Department of Public Enterprise for some time. These have proved very difficult to resolve. However, I am happy to state that the first of these difficulties is being addressed in section 18.</P>
    <P>The problem was that there was doubt as to the legal basis of the Salaried Officers and Clerks (GNR, CDR and IRCH) Superannuation Scheme, 1977, because the order enabling it was based on section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, which was repealed without a saver by the Transport (Reorganisation of Córas lompar Éireann) Act, 1986. Section 18 will remove the doubt as to the legal basis of this scheme by deeming the enabling order, and other orders over which there may also be doubt, to continue in force as if made under section 25 of the 1986 Act.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Ryan that we have not lost sight of the legal difficulties associated with the proposed amalgamation of the CIE salaried superannuation schemes. The difficulties in this regard relate to the absence of a statutory power to make these amalgamations. Departmental officials have been in discussion with officials of CIE and the Office of the Attorney General for some time with a view to drafting an appropriate statutory provision. It is the intention to introduce an appropriate amendment to this Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas if such an amendment can be drafted in time. I assure Deputy Ryan that the officials in question are currently working towards that deadline. I would welcome suggestions on Committee Stage from all Members on how this matter could be solved.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover all the issues raised by Deputies on Second Stage. There will be an opportunity to deal with the Bill in further detail on Committee Stage. I thank all those who contributed to the debate. We want decent legislation to emerge from our efforts. If constructive amendments are proposed on Committee and Report Stages, I undertake to give them full consideration.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Oil Storage Tanks.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, for extending his brief and coming to the House to respond to my remarks about regulations covering oil storage tanks.</P>
      <P>People in Cavan woke up this morning to the news that the premises of their local newspaper, <i>The Anglo Celt</i>, had been destroyed by fire. When the Garda and fire services arrived at the scene, it appeared that there was a relatively small fire at the back of the building. However, an oil tank then exploded, producing a much more dangerous situation. Our thoughts are with the firemen who were injured while fighting the fire. Despite the injuries to their men, the fire service succeeded in preventing a much bigger disaster.</P>
      <P>The case in Cavan is the latest example of the dangers posed by not having proper regulations in place to ensure that there are standards for storing oil. Unfortunately, I fear it will not be the last incident in a long list of accidents caused by these tanks. In most households and many schools, public houses and even hospitals oil is kept in plastic tanks at the back of the premises. Sometimes it is kept on top of the roof. Despite the obvious risks when there is a fire and of leaks, no proper standards are set for checking the safety of these tanks. Despite numerous representations from me and others over the years, there appears to be little movement on behalf of the Government to rectify this problem which is crucial to public safety. Throughout the years, I have attempted to ascertain what standards apply in this area only to discover the very disturbing fact that no standards apply to plastic storage tanks. The CEN standards being prepared by the European Standardisation Organisation will not be published until 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people choose to use oil to heat their homes, they need reassurance that the tanks in which the oil is stored will not create a health risk to themselves or their children or an acute safety risk in the case of fire or pollution. Just over a year ago, newspapers carried reports of a luxury house in Portmarnock which had been destroyed through the leakage of several gallons of oil into <Col N="1471" /> its foundations. The house had to be partially demolished to rectify a huge problem caused by a small crack in a plastic oil tank.</P>
    <P>The health effects on children who live in an area soaked in oil are horrific, as doctors will testify. In Carrickfergus in September of 1995, families with young children were obliged to flee their blazing homes when a fire which started at the rear of a terraced house spread and several domestic oil tanks melted. There is an obvious lack of protection in the almost universal use of plastic rather than the more fire resistant material, metal. The increased use of plastic in this type of tank is a further indication of our blasé attitude towards plastic. We think plastic is more modern and must therefore be more efficient and safe. In fact, the more traditional metal oil containers can be recycled and repaired and are much more fire resistant than plastic tanks if well maintained.</P>
    <P>Fire departments which have been faced with the destruction which occurs in the aftermath of fires involving oil tanks have called for investigations into the safety of plastic tanks. Following a fire which affected three houses in Naas, County Kildare, the fire chief for the county stated that the plastic oil tanks &ldquo;would appear to have no resistance to fire.we would not consider them safe&rdquo;. The assistant Chief Fire Officer in Dublin in 1996 wrote that because of the lack of standards and the absence of tests to compare the safety of steel and plastic tanks he &ldquo;could not recommend the use of such tanks at this point in time&rdquo;. If the fire services which witness daily the destruction and devastation caused by fires, call for plastic tanks to be regulated or banned, the Department should take note of their concerns.</P>
    <P>There is still a lack of proper regulations in this area so the position of fire officers on this matter cannot have changed. With the almost complete dominance of plastic oil tanks in households and elsewhere, the situation is more urgent than ever. What measures will be taken to check tanks which have already been installed to ensure their are no splits or cracks in them? When will regulations and legislation be introduced? There have been many casualties in this area and we do not want to see further damage to people, property and the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this serious matter and assure him I share his concern about the incident which has taken place in Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two distinct elements in the overall issue of safety standards referred to by the Deputy. The first relates to safety standards for oil storage tanks and the second to safety standards for oil transportation. In regard to safety standards for oil storage tanks, I should point out that in December 1997, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, introduced a revised and upgraded building control package. The new package applies to new <Col N="1472" /> building and reconstruction work which commenced on or after 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>Part J of the Building Regulations, 1997 requires that oil storage tanks which serve heat producing appliances shall be so located as to reduce to a reasonable level the risk of fire spreading from a building to the tank. The Minister also published revised technical guidance on the 1997 regulations which recommends the protection of oil storage tanks from the risk of fire-spread, including the provision of protective barriers in certain circumstances. The guidance also refers to the revised British Standard 5410, Part 1 of 1997 which applies to all oil storage tanks irrespective of the material, such as plastic or steel, from which the oil tanks are made. I also understand that CEN, the European standards body, is currently working on a draft European standard for plastic oil tanks and it is anticipated this will be completed by 2002.</P>
    <P>In regard to safety standards for oil transportation, section 25 of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 requires that any person engaged in the storage, labelling, packing or conveyance of any dangerous substance as defined in the Part IV Declaration Order to that Act shall take all practicable steps to prevent risk of injury to person or property. Regulations made under this Act, namely the Dangerous Substances (Petroleum Bulk Stores) Regulations of 1979, the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations of 1979 and the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) (Amendment) Regulations of 1988 provide that such stores shall be designed, planned and arranged to be suitable and adequate for the purposes of their use, in order to prevent risk of injury either to persons or property from petroleum.</P>
    <P>A number of requirements relate to the design, construction, installation and maintenance of storage tanks at such storage facilities. Under the Dangerous Substances Act, there is a requirement for such premises to be licensed by the local authority for the sale of petroleum spirit, or, if the store is owned by such local authority, by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>In relation to dangerous substances other than petroleum, for example heating oils, the encompassing storage requirements of section 25 of the Dangerous Substances Act apply. In addition, technical requirements for the materials, methods of construction, standards and other specifications for heat producing appliances and for the location of oil storage tanks serving such appliances are established under Part J of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations, 1997 and are applicable to buildings constructed after 1 June 1992.</P>
    <P>Transport of dangerous substances by road is also governed by regulations made under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, namely the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Petroleum by Road) Regulations of 1979, the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Sched<Col N="1473" /> uled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations of 1980, the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road ) (Trade or Business) (Amendment) Regulations of 1986, the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) (Amendment) Regulations of 1996 and the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Petroleum by Road) (Amendment) Regulations of 1996. These regulations establish the safety standards to be observed in the conveyance by road of petroleum and other dangerous substances. The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998 and the regulations to be made under it provide the legal basis to enable Ireland to accede to the ADR &ndash; the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road &ndash; and also to implement the EU ADR Framework Directive 94/55 and the directive introducing a system of road checks to ensure compliance with ADR &ndash; Directive 95/50/EC.</P>
    <P>The following are the main issues covered by the ADR and the EU Directives: the safe transport of dangerous goods by road in accordance with the requirements of ADR; the examination, testing and certification of transport equipment &ndash; vehicles; the type-approval of transport equipment &ndash; vehicles; the certification or approval of tanks, containers, etc.; the periodic examination and testing of such tanks, containers, etc.; the training and examination of drivers of dangerous goods vehicles; and, the recognition of certificates of competent authorities in other member states which are parties to the ADR.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity of the issues involved and the recognition that competencies in the areas outlined lie within the remit of a number of Government Departments, it has been necessary to identify the roles and tasks of each of the responsible parties to ensure the efficient enforcement of the requirements of the ADR and the EU Directives. To this end, regulations are in the process of being prepared by an interdepartmental working group and are expected to be finalised before the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>In view of the seriousness of this issue, I will make immediate representations to the Minister to seek to expedite matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why this shock in relation to reduced payments was landed on the farming community after what farmers have undergone in the past year and a half? The reduction seems to have come about as a result of the devaluation of the Irish punt in previous years. I understood reductions were frozen for the past two years when the Minister made an application to Brussels. Why has he not made a similar application this year? It is very serious that a pensioner relying on his farm retirement pension of £341.99 a month last month received only £299.80, which is £42.19 less than usual. That is a huge reduction of almost £500 a <Col N="1474" /> year. I understand that the average is even higher than that. I have also been told that this will affect REPS payments and all other EU payments which will be reduced by 5.05 per cent. Will it also affect headage payments? </P>
      <P>The Minister stated that details of compensation arrangements will be published in the middle of next year. He should spell out this evening to what extent compensation will be given. Will it be at a rate of 100 per cent of the reduction? It was a low act on the part of the Department of Agriculture and Food to hit the most vulnerable section of the farming community, people who have retired from farming and who had planned to live on a certain sum of money per month. It is a small enough amount of money without reducing it.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister made any demands on Brussels or has he kept his mouth shut completely? The Minister seems to have thrown in the towel and has not put up a fight in Brussels to have this devaluation offset. The Minister should withdraw this reduction immediately and demand that Brussels not recoup this money from the unfortunate farmers in question because it will seriously affect on them.</P>
      <P>At my clinic last weekend I met 20 people from my part of the constituency who are affected by this. The Minister has to get down to basics and explain to Brussels that this is not on so far as our farm pensioners are concerned. If the REP scheme is affected all hell will break loose and farmers will be back to square one because every other day brings a reduction in their income. How long more can that sector of society bear this treatment from the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this matter which is of concern to people in receipt of payments such as the farm retirement pension. I am pleased to have this opportunity of clarifying the matter and setting out the arrangements which were agreed at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in December to compensate farmers for the reduction of approximately 5 per cent in certain direct payments which has resulted from the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1 January 1999, institutional prices and amounts under the Common Agricultural Policy were fixed in ecus. The ecus were converted into national currency by means of agricultural conversion rates, more commonly known as green rates. From 1 January 1999 farm prices will be denominated in euros and, as the conversion rates to the euro have been irrevocably fixed from that date, green rates have been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The green rates which applied to certain direct payments to farmers, that is, livestock premia, arable aid, farm retirement pensions, REPS payments and certain forestry payments, were frozen in 1995. These frozen green rates were applicable only for a limited period and were due to lapse on the introduction of the euro. The Irish frozen green rate was 1 ecu to IR£0.829498. These direct <Col N="1475" /> payments will now be made at the euro rate of IR£0.787565, which is 5.055 per cent lower than the frozen green rate. The resulting loss to our farmers has been estimated at over £40 million. However, the agri-monetary arrangements for the introduction of the euro, which were agreed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in December, include compensation for such losses.</P>
    <P>Compensation will be paid over the next three years. Full compensation, 100 per cent funded by the EU, will be provided in 1999. Two further annual tranches of compensation will be paid, each reduced <i>vis-à-vis</i> the level of the previous tranche by at least a third of the amount paid out in the first tranche; these will be funded equally by the EU and member states, with the member state's contribution being optional.</P>
    <P>The details of the compensation due in each of the member states affected by the abolition of the frozen green rates are being worked out by the EU Commission. Sanction may not be received until May or June but arrangements will be made for the payment of compensation as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>We must remember the overall benefits of EMU for agriculture. The biggest single impact of EMU on agriculture, as on other sectors in the economy, is the fall in interest rates which it has caused. Agriculture is a highly indebted sector and has had a proportionately large gain from lower interest rates. Every 1 per cent drop in rates is worth about £20 million to the sector. As interest rates have already dropped by around 2 per cent due to EMU, this is worth up to £40 million per year to agriculture. This benefit is likely to rise as interest rates are expected to fall further and to be long-term, as it is generally accepted that euro interest rates will continue to be lower than Irish rates would be outside the EMU.</P>
    <P>Substantial benefits will also arise for the agri-food sector due to the elimination of foreign exchange transaction costs and risks on exports to euro countries. This is particularly important as the development strategy for the sector is to maximise exports into these high price countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and the Minister for being in the House.</P>
      <P>Three-in-one vaccine doses were administered in the late 1960s and early 1970s and there was an upsurge in the number of severe reactions in children who received them. Since first raising this issue, I have been inundated with queries from parents of children who received the vaccine and were subsequently brain damaged. The story is similar in many cases where parents have been unable to access accurate vaccination records from general practitioners or from the relevant health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> Currently a search is taking place within all health boards to see how many children received the controversial batch number 3741. However, an additional batch also failed the toxicity test and was more potent than 3741. Some 14 other batches manufactured over a 12-month period from May 1968 were never subjected to this toxicity test. These batches began with the number 3753 and ended with the number 3797. There are serious questions which must be answered by the Wellcome Foundation, now Glaxo Wellcome, and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C disaster has reinforced the view that the State was obliged in relation to the administration of blood to ensure that it was free from contamination. A similar obligation prevails in relation to the degree of care which must be adhered to in administering three-in-one vaccinations.</P>
    <P>In 1973, Eastern Health Board records show that the official in charge of the administration of the vaccine within that region was inundated with reports of severe reactions among children. She wrote to Wellcome to express concern and the company replied that it had no indications whatsoever as to the reasons for these. However, three years earlier, in 1970, a senior scientist in Wellcome had warned in a memo to senior colleagues that if further reports of severe reactions to the vaccine were received, it might be desirable to cease its manufacture.</P>
    <P>The pertussis or whooping cough element of the three-in-one vaccine is widely believed to have been responsible for the adverse reactions and the Eastern Health Board asked Wellcome about the possibility of reducing or altering the pertussis element of the vaccine. By 1974 in Ireland, the extent of the reactions to the three-in-one vaccine was such that more than 50 per cent of parents were opting not to have it and chose two-in-one instead, omitting the pertussis cover.</P>
    <P>The Government and Department of Health and Children spokespersons have consistently played down reports of reactions to the vaccine, but it was privately acknowledged both in the Department and among GPs that the lack of a structured reporting regime was preventing them from getting a full picture.</P>
    <P>In private correspondence to parents of brain damaged children in 1982, Deputy Woods, then Minister for Health, admitted that side effects, such as mental retardation, paralysis, collapse and convulsions were generally recognised as occurring occasionally following whooping cough vaccination. Yet, when the expert medical group concluded in 1982 that brain damage sustained by 14 of the 54 Irish children examined had in all probability resulted from the three-in-one vaccine, the Fianna Fáil Government pursued a policy of trying to buy off the parents by offering them once-off <i>ex gratia</i> payments of £10,000. This was despite strong advice from senior officials in the Department of Health and Children who urged at an early stage following the expert group's initial findings that it would be inconsist<Col N="1477" /> ent and inconclusive not to concede proper compensation. However, a small number of cash strapped parents of handicapped children took the paltry offer of £10,000. The Best family did not take this offer.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the case in the High Court Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton described Wellcome as negligent and criticised the company's quality control procedures. As the Department purchased these products from the Wellcome Foundation, it should be in a position to trace the offending batches and where they were administered. There are serious questions which must be answered and only an independent public inquiry can get to the truth of what became a nightmare for some of those who received three-in-one vaccination. I urge the Minister to investigate these allegations fully and come up with answers to the serious questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to an alleged link between the whooping cough component of the three-in-one vaccine and the occurrence of brain damage in children. It may be helpful to outline briefly the developments on this issue in Ireland since the 1970s. In response to concerns which had been expressed, the expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination was established in 1977 by the then Minister for Health to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination. The group was completely independent of the Department of Health in assessing cases. At the outset, it recognised that it would be impossible to prove conclusively in any case whether a person had been damaged by the whooping cough vaccine. Consequently, the group came to its conclusions on the balance of probability in individual cases. Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of the doubt to that person. The group found that in 16 of the 93 cases which were presented to the group, there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage. An <i>ex-gratia</i> payment was offered in each of these 16 cases.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the Supreme Court found in favour of Kenneth Best, whom it had been alleged had suffered brain damage as a result of receiving DTP &ndash; diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis &ndash; vaccine. The central issue in the Supreme Court case was the toxicity of a particular vaccine batch involved, namely, batch No. 3741, and the Supreme Court held that the pharmaceutical company, Wellcome, was liable for Kenneth Best's brain damage. The vaccine batch in question was produced in the summer of 1968 and had a two-year shelf life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the judgment in the Best case the Department wrote to the health boards in 1993 in an effort to ascertain the extent to which vaccine <Col N="1478" /> from batch 3741 had been used in Ireland. The boards did not succeed in tracing information in this regard. Following receipt of additional information from Glaxo Wellcome in 1997 and 1998 regarding the lot numbers of the vaccine produced from batch 3741, my Department wrote to the health boards to ask them to examine their records to see if the extent of usage of these lots in Ireland in the period 1968-70 could be established. Final responses have been received from seven of the eight health boards. These indicate that in many cases immunisation records for the period in question are no longer in existence. Those which do exist do not always contain the lot number of the vaccine used, as it was not routine practice to record this information at that time.</P>
    <P>The health boards' responses to date show that the use of vaccine from some of the lots in question was recorded in 243 cases. The boards in whose areas such usage was recorded are the Mid-Western Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board. My Department is currently considering the health boards' responses with a view to determining what, if any, further action is appropriate in the matter.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of adverse reaction to immunisations, it is recognised that, in common with all vaccines and therapeutic substances, there is a small risk of such reactions occurring. The identification and use of contraindications to vaccine has helped reduce any potential risk. As regards national policy, it is considered that the benefits of immunisation to children far outweigh any potential risk and that immunisation protects them and the community at large from the serious consequences of a range of serious diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, polio and tuberculosis. This is the view not only of the Department of Health and Children and the medical, paediatric and public health experts, but also international experts and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>By way of illustration of the benefits of immunisation, it is noteworthy that in 1955 over 3,400 cases of whooping cough and 39 deaths from the disease were reported in Ireland, whereas in 1997 the number of reported cases was 459, with no deaths. General practitioners contracted to provide immunisations under the primary childhood immunisation scheme are aware of the contraindications to the  recommended childhood immunisations and are required to provide parents and guardians with pre-immunisation advice and information.</P>
    <P>In relation to concerns regarding alleged vaccine related brain damage, my Department has no evidence which would suggest there is any link between vaccination and the subsequent development of neurological damage. Extensive international research has been conducted over many years regarding the possible link between the pertussis component of the DPT vaccine and chronic brain damage. The consensus in the medical <Col N="1479" /> literature is that it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between this vaccine and the development of permanent neurological damage. This view is confirmed in the immunisation guidelines for Ireland, produced in 1996 by the Royal College of Physicians, which advises that &ldquo;although there has been controversy about pertussis vaccine the consensus from authoritative bodies is that it is a safe vaccine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that compared to other European countries we have a high incidence of vaccine-preventable disease. This is despite the fact that we have a free primary childhood immunisation programme which is both safe and effective in preventing these serious diseases. I am also concerned that our immunisation programme is being affected by the ongoing adverse publicity about an issue which first arose many years ago and which has long been resolved as far as other countries are concerned. I would therefore again stress the safety and effectiveness of modern vaccines and urge parents to ensure they have their children immunised so as to protect them against a range of potentially serious yet preventable childhood diseases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter in the House. The threat of industrial action in Tallaght Hospital is the latest and most alarming chapter in the short history of this new hospital. What began as a crisis is rapidly turning into a disaster. The prospect of all out strike action at the hospital beggars belief and a super-human effort is required by all the key players, particularly the Minister for Health and Children, if the hospital is to be put on a sound footing and allowed to develop as it should.</P>
      <P>It is worth remembering that we are talking about the biggest investment in a hospital facility by the State in a rapidly growing area of Dublin city. It is a state of the art centre of excellence which promised to be a flagship for today's health services. Yet a few short months after opening, the hospital has been undermined by gross underfunding, poor communications and management and by Government and ministerial diktat. The resultant extent of demoralisation among the staff has reached the point where no one appears to have confidence in the Minister to deal fairly and competently with the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering how successful the opening of Tallaght Hospital has been and how the high level of patient satisfaction has been maintained in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. The move from three run-down hospitals was carried out with skill and efficiency. In reply to a parliamentary question in April 1998 the Minister stated: &ldquo;enormous efforts have been and are being made by very committed people, including the staff of the transferring hospitals, <Col N="1480" /> construction staff and suppliers&rdquo;. He went on to say the move was done in a spirit of partnership and dedication in the interests of the patients. Indeed since opening, productivity in the accident and emergency department alone has increased by 30 per cent in comparison to that of the original three base hospitals. Yet it is the same dedicated staff who are now threatening to go on strike against a background of the disintegration of trust and confidence which originated long before the opening of the hospital.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, because of departmental miscalculations from the start, cost overruns became a matter of concern to the board of Tallaght Hospital. The Department was advised of the prospect of serious funding deficiencies. Yet it is clear that in their determination to get the hospital open, the Minister and his Department did not take sufficient heed of the warnings of the board and the chief executive. It is clear from the Deloitte &amp; Touche report that the board erroneously, as it turned out, believed that the Department was taking its submission seriously.</P>
    <P>When he did act, the Minister sent in consultants who made a report itemising the problems relating to management and funding. The board accepted the findings of the report and undertook to work to resolve the difficulties but its commitment and co-operation has, regrettably, not been reciprocated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not acknowledged that the origin of the chaos now looming at Tallaght Hospital is in a formula used by his Department in calculating a budget based on a faulty premise. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report gets to the nub of the problem. It says the decision to base the 1998 determination on the cost structure of the three base hospitals plus certain additional moneys was inappropriate. It goes on to say that it has concluded that the determination process does not lend itself well to a situation of major change such as the opening of a new hospital. To this day, I do not believe the Minister has accommodated the conclusions.</P>
    <P>The report outlines the profile methodology which should have been undertaken and it is damning in its conclusion that early financial planning would have brought about the benefits required to keep Tallaght Hospital from running into difficulties. The Minister's refusal to face up to this core failure in his Department is now leading the hospital into dangerous and uncharted waters. The current situation is impossible to reconcile. He simply cannot square the circle on this one.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will claim he has provided for an increase in this year's determination and while that is true, it is not enough. If the board is to keep within the limits of the 1999 service plan, there will inevitably be a loss of services and of jobs and a breakdown in industrial relations. Certainly, if nothing else, there will be a curtailment in developing services which are so essential to the future growth of the hospital. This is an untenable prospect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> Will the Minister outline in detail how he intends to deal with the current impasse? It is worth noting that when the Taoiseach visited Tallaght Hospital last Friday the Minister was noticeable by his absence. A visit which should have been a triumph was noted for the distance which the Taoiseach kept from patients and patients' families who had hoped to talk to him about their concerns. It is indicative of a breakdown between the Government and the Tallaght Hospital which is supposed to be a flagship of modern Irish acute hospital care, that we have reached this point. It has lead to plummeting morale among staff and demoralisation to an extent which I have not witnessed before in the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister avail of this opportunity to outline in detail how he intends to deal with the problems and undo the damage done in terms of the gross underfunding at the start and inherent to the tune of £5 million the deficiencies of the current 1999 budget? Will he outline the number of jobs at risk in this current dispute and assure the House he will not accept a service plan which provides for cutbacks in services or job losses in a hospital which is still only operating at approximately 60 per cent capacity and still requires further investment if it is to realise its full potential and prevent its downgrading at a time when demands for hospital care are escalating?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on Tallaght Hospital found that staff numbers on the hospital's payroll on 11 October 1998 were 139 whole-time equivalents above approved levels. This number included 40.7 commissioning staff which the hospital anticipated would be released by April 1999. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department is currently awaiting the hospital's service plan for 1999 which should provide details on the current position and state how the hospital proposes to manage this situation.</P>
      <P>I understand that as of the week ending 24 January 1999 the gap has reduced to 109 in the normal course of events. I have also stated that I expect the hospital to comply with relevant labour legislation and best industrial relations practice in accordance with the industrial relations protocol agreed with the unions. This protocol covers issues such as best industrial relations/personnel practice, security of tenure, agreed procedures, recruitment and promotion and has been incorporated in the hospital's charter. It was agreed in the context of the transfer of services to and the opening of Tallaght Hospital.</P>
      <P>The security of tenure provision ensured that the issue of compulsory redundancy did not arise in the context of the transfer of services to Tallaght Hospital. Furthermore, provision was made for the concession of permanent status to long-term temporary staff subject to certain conditions. This commitment was honoured by the Department in August 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1997 a co-operation agreement between staff and management to cater for the transfer of staff to Tallaght Hospital was finalised. <Col N="1482" /> I take this opportunity to again pay tribute to the staff of the hospital at all levels who ensured the successful transfer to Tallaght Hospital on 21 June last.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I agreed to an extension on the time limit for submission of the hospital's service plan until 12 February next. This extension was agreed to initially following contact with the Department by the chairman of the Tallaght Hospital group of unions. It allows the three person group which I established to oversee the implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report have an input into the service plan.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that approximately £69 million is available to the hospital for 1999. Given the hospital's case mix and state of the art facilities, I am satisfied this amount is sufficient to meet pay and non-pay costs, including the full year costs of 1998 developments. The determination does not include any provision for the further development of services; it has been agreed that the detail of such development will be the subject of further discussions with my Department when it is clear that the recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report made a number of recommendations on the control of pay costs at the hospital. These include the need to prepare a realistic manpower plan &ndash; the staffing requirement needs to be adequately assessed and the need to ensure the provision of accurate timely information on personnel and pay. Specifically, the hospital must consolidate the three base hospitals' payrolls into one. They also recommend that agreement must be reached between the hospital and the Department on an approved level of staff, that processes should be put in place to manage and control temporary staff, vacancies should only be filled in respect of approved and funded posts, staff recruitment should be frozen until the review of requirements is complete, that a systematic plan to reduce commissioning staff is required to ensure the hospital's objective of releasing the remainder of such staff by April 1999 is met and improved controls over authorisation and approval of overtime payments are required.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree with me that these recommendations are perfectly reasonable. The key recommendation is that the overall staffing requirement needs to be assessed. Despite the numerous requests by the Department, a realistic manpower plan was not prepared by the hospital. Now that the troika is in place, I expect this area is one to which particular attention will be paid.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous media reports about pending job cuts at Tallaght Hospital with numbers as high as 200 mentioned. It has also been said that this is because the hospital budget was &ldquo;cut&rdquo; by £4.8 million &ndash; this is simply not the case. The hospital's budget has increased by 20 per cent in 1999. It is not clear to me from where the speculation is coming. However, until the ser<Col N="1483" /> vice plan is submitted, I am not in a position to comment further.</P>
    <P>Senior officials of the Department together with a representative from the Health Service Employers' Agency met trade union representatives on Tuesday of this week. I understand the trade unions met hospital management the previous day.</P>
    <P>Tuesday's meeting was very useful &ndash; there is no question of a break-down in my Department's <Col N="1484" /> relationship with either management or staff. The positive relationship will continue both on a formal and informal basis. Both I and my Department are fully committed to establishing the hospital on a firm footing. I am confident that with a positive attitude from all sides it will be possible to resolve the current difficulties at Tallaght Hospital. This is critical in the interests of current and future patients of the hospital.</P>

      <QRef>[3076/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): We are not talking here about the abduction of children in circumstances of family conflict. Obviously, the Deputy tabled this question because of the number of media reports of suspicious approaches which have been made to children in recent months. I am concerned about this matter. All such reports are treated seriously by the Garda authorities and fully investigated. In response to the recent reported incidents, the Garda press office issued a statement last December reminding parents not to take their children's personal safety for granted, to avoid having their children wait alone outside school and to be aware of their children's whereabouts at all times.</P>
    <P>I understand the national bureau of criminal investigation is co-ordinating all incidents of suspicious approaches made to children. In the period September to December 1998, approximately 100 incidents were reported to the Garda Síochána in circumstances where children were out alone, either playing or on their way home from school. About half of these occurred in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The classification of such incidents in the statistics depends on the outcome of each investigation. It has to be determined whether a crime was committed in some of these cases or whether there was intent to commit a crime. All reports are taken seriously and fully investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Even if some of the reports were the result of misunderstandings or of cases where children may have overreacted, we must take all of them seriously. I am concerned that the media coverage of these events generates a substantial fear of crime, particularly in relation to the alleged increase in the number of paedophiles in Ireland as result of the establishment of the sex offenders register in the United Kingdom. No register is foolproof and a paedophile whose name is on the register in the United Kingdom is still in a position to come here for a short period without being in breach of the law in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that informal protocols exist between the Garda Síochána and police forces in other jurisdictions where they are aware of the movements of convicted child abusers. This information is confidential and it would be inappropriate to share it with third parties.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department met recently with <Col N="1486" /> officials of the Home Office to discuss the operation of the register in the United Kingdom which claims to have a 95 per cent compliance rate. There was a useful exchange of information. I intend bringing a memorandum to Government in the near future to progress this issue and will consider, in detail, how such a register would work here. We may need a wide range of measures to reduce the potential for offending which paedophiles present. This may involve assessments by multidisciplinary teams of the risk which different categories of sex offender present. I want to ensure we develop an appropriate and effective solution. A comprehensive response is required to sex offending generally, which is the subject of understandable concern.</P>

      <P>I assume the question refers to the most recent report on medical and therapeutic facilities within prison establishments prepared by the director of prison medical services who is an official of my Department. While the report is for the calendar year 1997, it refers to previous reports covering earlier years.</P>
      <P>My Department received a request last year for access to this report under the Freedom of Information Act. As the Deputy will be aware, the Act makes provision for the appointment of deciding officers within each Department, whose function is to decide whether access should be provided to information that may be the subject of a request under the Act. The Act also provides for an internal departmental review mechanism to consider appeals.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer and the appeals officer decided that the request for access to the report in question should be refused. This decision was appealed last October to the information commissioner, who must make a decision within four months from the time he receives the appeal. The information commissioner's office has been in contact with my Department about the appeal and consultations are ongoing.</P>
      <P>When the decision of the information commissioner is received &ndash; it is expected shortly &ndash; my Department will implement it fully, whether the decision is to refuse access to the report completely or partially or to allow complete access.</P>

      <P>This was a tragic incident which resulted in the death of a person. Our first thoughts have to turn to the family and friends of the deceased and I express my condolences to them. Nothing we can do can make up for the grief they have suffered.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a member of the Garda Síochána was subsequently prosecuted and convicted of a number of offences under the Road Traffic Acts in connection with this incident. The criminal proceedings in respect of those charges were completed on 14 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The matter does not rest there. It is a matter of concern when a member of the Garda Síochána is convicted of a criminal offence and the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, set out the procedures to be followed and the sanctions that can be imposed in the case of disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the criminal proceedings, the Garda authorities initiated a disciplinary investigation. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation is now complete and a disciplinary inquiry, that is, a hearing before a board appointed by the Garda Commissioner, will be held shortly.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 1998 a total of 1,739 persons were reported to the Garda Síochána as missing, of whom 12 remained untraced at the end of the year. I am aware of public concern on the issue, which I share. As the Deputy is aware I have a special interest in the matter and I am doing all I can to ensure the Garda Síochána has effective arrangements in <Col N="1488" /> place and the necessary resources to trace those who are reported missing.</P>
    <P>I have previously informed the House about the TRACE Unit, headed by an assistant commissioner, which was established by the Garda Commissioner specifically to re-examine the original investigations of six cases. The unit is engaged in developing profiles of men who have exhibited serious sexual violence against women.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities continuously review the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases. Recent improvements include the introduction of new guidelines and procedures which place particular emphasis on the role of Garda liaison officers in keeping the families of missing persons informed.</P>

      <Quest>if the Garda are re-examining the effectiveness of the enforcement of road traffic legislation in view of the high number of deaths and injuries in traffic accidents in 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement of road traffic legislation is given a high priority by the Garda authorities. I have been informed by the Commissioner that the effectiveness of this enforcement is reviewed continuously. A number of measures have been taken.</P>
      <P>The Garda national traffic policy bureau, under the direction of a chief superintendent, was established in July 1997. The primary focus of the bureau is policy development, with particular emphasis on formulating proactive enforcement strategies aimed at reducing road deaths and road accidents.</P>
      <P>The special Garda road traffic enforcement campaign, Operation Lifesaver, was initially launched in 1997 in the Louth-Meath area and was extended nationwide towards the end of that year. It is the subject of ongoing reviews.</P>
      <P>As a result of Operation Lifesaver, the four offences of excessive speeding, drink driving, failure to wear seat belts and dangerous/careless driving have been identified as major factors in fatal and serious injury accidents and have been singled out for particular attention by the Garda Síochána in its enforcement policies. These offences will continue to be targeted in 1999.</P>
      <P>The campaign involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks, in addition to an extensive road safety publicity campaign which involves media campaigns, using national and local radio stations, and school programmes designed to educate road users on the need to exercise care on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is in possession of a wide range of speed detection equipment such as radar guns, in-car video systems and laser devices as <Col N="1489" /> well as GATSO &ndash; a mobile unit, equipped with on-board camera and computer facilities. The Garda Síochána purchased four additional GATSO units in 1998, thus bringing the total number to five units which are deployed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the on-the-spot fine system which was extended to cover speeding offences in December 1997, a total of 191,834 notices were issued in the period December 1997 to December 1998. Approximately 75 per cent were paid without a court appearance by the defendant.</P>
    <P>The Government launched the national strategy on road safety in July 1998 the primary target of which is to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries by at least 20 per cent by 2002. The strategy is providing a detailed framework plan encompassing legislative change, enforcement, new technology, multi-agency co-operation as well as a wider public ownership of road safety. The implementation of the strategy will assist the Garda Síochána in its enforcement campaigns. The strategy recommended the extension of the on-the-spot fine system to the following offences: non-wearing of seat belts; stop-yield sign infringements; box junction violations, and defective tyres. The introduction of these measures by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 1 February 1999 fulfils the commitment given to the extension of the on the spot fine system in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Another measure recommended in the national strategy on road safety is the introduction of evidential breath testing. I understand the Garda authorities are working in conjunction with the medical bureau of road safety to introduce this measure nationwide by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The national strategy on road safety supports consideration being given to the introduction of a penalty points system and this issue will be fully explored by all the agencies involved in road safety in 1999. The legislation which will bring this about is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that there was a slight reduction in road traffic fatalities and injuries in 1998 compared to 1997. Provisional figures for 1998 show that 461 persons were killed compared to 471 in 1997, while the number of those injured during 1998 totalled 10,271 compared to 12,087 in the previous year. While the incidence of death and injury rightly remains a source of serious concern the figures suggest that the road traffic enforcement measures being undertaken by the Garda authorities are taking effect.</P>
    <P>Long-term reductions in fatal and serious injury accidents will not solely be achieved by Garda enforcement measures. There must also be a change in the mindset of drivers and other road users to one of compliance with the law, a fundamental change in driving habits, including courtesy, with a considerable improvement in driving behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities will continue to monitor <Col N="1490" /> their road safety enforcement policing campaigns throughout 1999 and, where necessary, effect necessary changes. I will continue to support the Garda authorities where the need for additional resources and equipment is identified by them.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the procedures are reasonable, fair, transparent and in accordance with the philosophy of the Refugee Act. They are also in accordance with our international obligations and humanitarian traditions in this area.</P>
      <P>My Department is not aware of any misgivings held by asylum seekers in relation to the asylum interview procedures.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the crime statistics most frequently referred to in this House are the statistics contained in the annual report of Garda Síochána. The Garda are responsible for the production of crime statistics which arise from the crimes which are reported to them or which become known to them. Organised crime and minor offences alike are featured in the Garda crime statistics. I am assured by the Garda authorities that all crimes which are reported to the Garda are the subject of appropriate investigation, attention and reflection in the Garda crime statistics.</P>
      <P>Of course, neither the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform nor the Garda Commissioner nor anyone else is in a position to guarantee that every single crime which occurs is reported to the Garda. The problem of estimating the amount of crime which is not reported to the police is well known in the field of criminology, and is by no means unique to Ireland. While a small number of Irish research studies have examined this issue, there is no clear consensus on the question of how many crimes are not reported to the Garda. Judging by the research available, it is fair to say that unreported crimes tend to be less serious than those that are reported.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the numbers of complaints made to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board in recent years, which the board has documented and commented upon in its reports.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to determine specific causes in relation to the observed increase in complaints. However, as with similar bodies such as the office of the Ombudsman, the level of complaints is generally observed to increase as the general public becomes more aware of these organisations and the functions they perform.</P>
      <P>In relation to reform of the board, the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, obliges the board to keep under review the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and to report to me on these matters every three years.</P>
      <P>In the last such published triennial report, the complaints board expressed it as their view that the Act generally provides the board with the powers necessary to ensure a thorough and impartial investigation of complaints. However, the board went on to propose certain legislative and procedural changes that would, in the opinion of the board, enhance its effectiveness and efficiency while, at the same time, improving the quality of service to both members of the public and of the Garda Síochána alike.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment made certain recommendations in relation to the composition of the complaints board and of the disciplinary tribunals appointed by it which the Government agreed to consider.</P>
      <P>In the light of these various recommendations, my Department is currently conducting a review of the Act and its operation, which involves consultation with interested parties, including the Garda Síochána the Director of Public Prosecutions and the complaints board itself.</P>

Following the review, which was overseen by the Garda authorities, the CSC and my Department, changes were made in the CSC selection procedures.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these are based on up-to-date techniques of selection and, most importantly, are job-related. My concern is that the CSC selection procedures identify those candidates most likely to perform effectively in the important job of Garda and there are no plans, at present, for changes in these procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not accept that the percentage of candidates rejected at the interview stage is exceptionally large. The average pass rate at the interview stage for applicants under the new procedures is currently 56 per cent compared to an interview pass rate of only 50 per cent under the selection procedures used for the 1994 competition. Indeed, the last group of candidates who <Col N="1495" /> attended for interview between 16 November and 17 December last had a pass rate of 59 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following are the statistics to date for 1999. It must be borne in mind that because the period to which these statistics relate is so recent that the detection rates, at this stage, are therefore correspondingly low given that investigation of these offences is still in progress.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the statistics are compiled on the basis of Garda divisions, which do not always coincide with county boundaries. For this reason it is not possible to give a separate figure for each county.</P>

    <P>With regard to Operation Shannon, I am informed by the Garda authorities that this initiative, has since been replaced by Operation Oisin, which was introduced in the western region during October 1998. The operation involves all the Garda districts in the region and it is based on the deployment of a series of checkpoints, in strategic locations.</P>

      <P>The waiting times for appointments with solicitors as at 31 December, 1998 are set out in the table which I will have circulated within the Official Report. In three law centres the waiting time for appointment was less than one month, in six law centres it was between one and three months, in five law centres it was <Col N="1496" /> between three and six months, in eight law centres it was between six and 12 months, in four law centres it was between 12 and 18 months and in four law centres the waiting time was greater than 18 months.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Legal Aid Board I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board. I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources. Where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board intends to extend the scheme on a nation-wide basis in the coming months. The private practitioners scheme provides a complimentary legal service to that which is already available from the Law Centres. The expansion nationwide of the private practitioners scheme, should increase the throughput of legally aided cases and also enable the law centres to devote more resources towards non-District Court matters.</P>
      <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis. For example, 1,879 of the 8,722 appointments offered in law centres in 1998 were for priority matters. None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists. In the Dublin area, 911 appointments were offered through the private practitioner scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board in 1998.</P>
      <P>In order to combat the increase in waiting times I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million and I am further increasing the allocation this year. In consultation with the Minister for Finance I am reviewing the Legal Aid Board's estimate for 1999 which stands at £10.953 million at present. I hope to substantially increase this amount prior to the publication of the 1999 revised Estimates for public services later this month. In addition a further allocation of £1 million is being allocated for legal services for asylum seekers bringing the total current allocation to £11.953 million, an increase of 24 per cent over last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board. Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, were for law centres. In addition I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff, including three relief solicitors. The board, which has sanction for 89 solicitor posts, currently employs 86 solicitors. A competition is under way to fill the remaining three posts and the board is confident it will have its full complement of 89 solicitors in place shortly. <Col N="1497" /> I believe that these allocations should help to alleviate the situation with regard to waiting times in the law centres.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that crime statistics are compiled on the basis of Garda operational areas, which do not always coincide with county boundaries. For this reason it is not possible to give a separate figure for County Meath, and I can therefore refer only to the Louth-Meath division.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that according to provisional crime figures for 1998, 58 robberies were recorded in the Louth-Meath division. This represents a decrease of 21 per cent from the previous year and 26 of these robberies, 45 per cent, are recorded as having been detected. The value of property stolen in these robberies is estimated to be in the region of £80,000.</P>
      <P>I also understand that over the same period, 1,847 burglaries were recorded in the division which represents a decrease of 2 per cent over 1997. A total of 591, or 32 per cent, of these burglaries have so far been detected. The value of property taken in these burglaries is estimated to be approximately £2,000,000.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that these are the provisional crime figures for 1998, and subject to change as Garda investigations progress. The Annual Garda Report on Crime for 1998 will contain the final figures when it is published later in the year.</P>

      <P>The average annual cost of keeping an offender in custody in 1998 was about £52,000. A breakdown between the various prisons and places of detention is not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By far the largest element of this cost, about 80 per cent, relates to pay and overtime to prison officers. I am not satisfied particularly with the high level of overtime expenditure in the prison service. In this regard, the whole area of prison costs, and especially staffing costs, is being examined at present by a dedicated prisons staffing and operations review team who will be providing me, over the next 12 months, with reports on the most efficient and cost-effective use of staff resources at each of the prisons and places of detention. In the meantime, also, the central and local management of the prison service are engaged in a pro<Col N="1499" /> cess of identifying and implementing measures which will reduce the dependence on overtime working in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be referring in his question to the difference in the cost of keeping an offender in custody against the cost of a non-custodial punishment. In this regard, I should point out that in the majority of cases, offenders who are committed to a custodial sentence had previously undergone some form of non-custodial sentence and imprisonment was a last resort. I am, however, committed to the development of alternatives to custody and I expect to receive, in mid-1999, the final report of the Expert Group on the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present 29 full-time professionals and two consultants involved in rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders in prisons. Four of these are working on the dedicated sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison and <Col N="1500" /> the remainder are involved in one to one counselling.</P>
    <P>All convicted sex offenders who are in custody, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison. Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are found to be suitable. All sex offenders are encouraged to avail of treatment. However, they cannot be compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending. It is suggested from time to time that all sex offenders should simply be compelled to avail themselves of treatment and that it is not good enough to confine treatment to those who volunteer. The professional advice given to me is that while it is certainly valid to encourage offenders to participate, compulsory treatment simply would not work. There would be no point &ndash; in fact it would be quite dangerous &ndash; in giving the impression that an offender about to be released was reasonably safe simply because he had been forced through a treatment programme.</P>
    <P>The sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill can cater for up to ten offenders at any one time and takes ten to eleven months to complete. The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies. Where more than ten offenders who have applied are considered suitable, the places on the next programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence. The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme. There are currently ten offenders undergoing this programme in Arbour Hill prison in addition to 43 offenders undergoing one to one counselling provided by my Department's clinical psychology service and the probation and welfare service. At present there are 26 offenders waiting to take part in the programme in Arbour Hill and 20 offenders are awaiting one to one counselling.</P>
    <P>I am determined to increase the number of group treatment places available to sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is examining the possibility of locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh place of detention. In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, it is taking some time to put a new programme in place. Of course, as I have already said, any prisoner currently there may apply to participate in the dedicated treatment programme in Arbour Hill.</P>
    <P>A new non-therapeutic programme for offenders &ndash; The Thinking Skills Training Programme was introduced in Arbour Hill Prison early in 1998. A significant number of sex offenders in Arbour Hill have commenced this new programme. A similar programme has also been introduced in Cork prison.</P>
    <P>My Department has also commissioned the clinical psychology department at University College Dublin to conduct a detailed evaluation of <Col N="1501" /> the group treatment programme at Arbour Hill. This will take a number of years to complete and should eventually provide empirical data that demonstrates the efficacy of treatment, as measured by reduced recidivism amongst treated offenders compared to an untreated group.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the prisons staffing and operations review team are as recommended in the report of the prison service operating cost review group, that is, &ldquo;that a staffing review project be initiated and a small team of practitioners recruited to undertake an assessment of the man-hours to deliver the agreed regime activities and services and to recommend associated systems of attendance and deployment practices&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The team was not established solely to look at the issue of overtime but rather, in accordance with the terms of reference, to assess the current staffing and operational procedures of the various institutions and the prison service as a whole and to make general and specific recommendations as to how the work of the service might be carried out in a more effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The report of the team will, in fact, consist of up to 18 reports on individual institutions and facilities and an overall prison service report.

      <P>The position is that in the light of the recent High Court decision in the Laurentiu case dealing with deportation orders I am giving priority to the enactment of an Immigration Bill. Some of the provisions of the Illegal Immigrants Bill will be contingent on the provisions of the Immigration Bill and cannot be finalised pending the enactment of that Bill.</P>
      <P>I have indicated previously that the Illegal Immigrants Bill will be aimed at the activities of those who organise and engage in the trafficking of illegal immigrants. The Bill will provide a framework by which those who engage in the trafficking of illegal immigrants can be dealt under the law. The Bill will provide for the creation of an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants with appropriate penalties which in addition to fines and imprisonment will include, in certain circumstances, the forfeiture of the means of transport used in illegal immigrant trafficking. I do not anticipate any delay in finalising these proposals once the Immigration Bill I have referred to has been enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, fully committed to reducing the amount of reoffending in the criminal justice system. There are four divisions of my Department which are involved in this area, prisons division, crime division, courts division and probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>The prison side are involved with the setting up of work, training and education programmes whereby prisoners are encouraged to work and-or attend at the educational or training courses available. The work available covers a broad range of practical skills ranging from home economics to metalwork and woodwork. Education courses are chosen to give opportunities to those in prison to acquire knowledge and expertise which will help them secure employment on release from prison and so aid rehabilitation. These education courses range from basic literacy skills to Open University.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are treatment programmes for drug offenders available in all prison institutions as part of the general medical services available to all inmates. Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation will be supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling. The level of treatment available to drug addicted offenders is under ongoing review. Further improvements to the services are being planned for 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sex offenders, there are two forms of therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system. Both are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour. The first is individual counselling from the Department's clinical psychology service and from the probation and welfare service. The second is an intensive offence-focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison. While all sex offenders can apply for inclusion in this programme, regardless of the institution in which they are imprisoned, not all are considered, suitable for the programme. Sex <Col N="1504" /> offenders are professionally assessed before being allowed on the programme.</P>
    <P>My Department has also introduced a new programme for offenders called a Thinking Skills Course which commenced this year in Arbour Hill and Cork prisons. This course includes representatives of the education, psychology and probation and welfare services, along with prison officers who work together to form multi-disciplinary teams to deliver this programme. It has been shown that in other jurisdictions i.e. Canada and England, this programme can successfully help offenders avoid reoffending.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a successful alternative to violence project has operated since 1998. Over 500 participants have taken part in workshops in Mountjoy male and female prisons, Wheatfield and Limerick. In addition, voluntary bodies such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Samaritans, Anna Livia, Coolmine Therapeutic Community and the Merchant's Quay Project and others have significant involvement in the prisons in providing support for offenders with particular needs.</P>
    <P>In relation to juvenile crime, my Department has recently announced a significant expansion in the number of Garda special projects which it funds. The projects are tangible crime prevention measures and are run in conjunction with youth organisations. The current network of projects are the subject of an evaluation being carried out by the children's research centre, Trinity College. Six new projects are being established in Dublin in &ndash; Donore Avenue, Hardwicke Street, O'Devaney Gardens, Ballybrack/Loughlinstown, Lower Ballyfermot and Ballymun &ndash; Bray, Tralee, Sligo and Waterford. The recent report of the National Crime Forum highlighted the need to invest in prevention particularly where juvenile crime was concerned. Since I took up office the number of projects has doubled from 12 to 24.</P>
    <P>I have also received Government approval for the establishment of a drug courts planning committee to prepare plans for the establishment of a drug courts pilot project in the District Court in Dublin this year.</P>
    <P>The development of a drug courts system on a pilot basis marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure for dealing with the less serious and non-violent drug offenders. It is the beginning of a fundamental realignment of the response of the criminal justice system to those involved in less serious drug-related offences. In effect, drug courts afford persons in trouble with the law on foot of having committed minor or non-violent drug-related offences an opportunity to be treated under courts supervision as an alternative to the more usual penal sanctions which can be imposed. I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course and if the US experience &ndash; which shows that criminal activity for drug crimes decreases or is eliminated as a result of treatment &ndash; is repeated here, I believe that this initiative is likely to have a pro<Col N="1505" /> found effect over time on how we as a society deal with less serious drug-related crime.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service also plays a significant role in fostering public safety and promoting the common good by advancing the recognition and use of community based sanctions, thereby reducing the level of reoffending. The main strategic objectives of the service are: the targeting of high risk offenders through assessment, challenging offending behaviour and making demands on offenders to recognise the damage caused to victims; the stimulating of young offenders from disadvantaged areas in particular to address life-style issues and augment their skills, so that they can realistically aim at training and employment opportunities and avoidance of reoffending; the provision of specialised projects in areas of disadvantage to enable these objectives to be achieved such as the North Clondalkin Probation Project, the West Tallaght Probation Project, Southill Outreach Project and Auto-Crime Project in Cork; working in liaison with others in criminal justice and front line agencies in achieving an integrated approach to the reduction of reoffending thereby promoting social inclusion; the provision of funding to groups working in association with the service to enable special projects to be developed; and implementing court orders &ndash; probation and community service which are effective supervision programmes requiring offenders on supervision to review their attitudes and outlook in life and to understand and accept their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the Legal Aid Board, I am aware of the demands on its services. In consultation with the board I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board. I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase, notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources. Where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> The Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board intends to extend the scheme on a nation-wide basis in the coming months. The private practitioners scheme provides a complementary legal service to that which is already available from the law centres. The expansion nation-wide of the private practitioners scheme should increase the throughput of legally aided cases and also enable the law centres to devote more resources towards non District Court matters.</P>
    <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis. For example, 1,879 of the 8,722 appointments offered in law centres in 1998 were for priority matters. None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists. In the Dublin area, 911 appointments were offered through the private practitioner scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board in 1998.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the increase in waiting times, I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million and I am further increasing the allocation this year. In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I am reviewing the Legal Aid Board's estimate for 1999 which stands at £10.953 million at present. I hope to substantially increase this amount prior to the publication of the 1999 Revised Estimates for Public Services later this month. In addition, a further allocation of £1 million is being allocated for legal services for asylum seekers bringing the total current allocation to £11.953 million, an increase of 24 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>Last July I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board. Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, were for law centres. In addition, I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff, including three relief solicitors. The board, which has sanction for 89 solicitor posts, currently employs 86 solicitors. A competition is currently under way to fill the remaining three posts and the board is confident it will have its full compliment of 89 solicitors in place shortly. I believe that these allocations should help to alleviate the situation with regard to waiting times in the law centres.</P>

      <P>The National Crime Forum represented, in my opinion, a unique consultation process for the Government, the Department and the criminal justice system. The report touches on many issues and makes recommendations on the establishment and composition of a crime council. In regard to that specific recommendation, I have already signalled my intention to establish a crime council and the forum's proposals for the framework for a council are under urgent consideration in my Department with a view to its establishment at an early date.</P>
      <P>The forum's views provide a valuable base to inform policy in the general criminal justice area and indeed takes forward some of the sentiments expressed in the Department's &ldquo;Tackling Crime&rdquo; discussion paper. While these views are currently being examined by my Department, there are a few specific aspects I would like to mention at this stage. The forum's views as regards the need for research to assist policy formulation are something I fully subscribe to. As recently as 1997, no funding was provided for this basic need in the then Department of Justice. Since taking up office, I am pleased to say that no less than 15 projects are under way and that a sum of £400,000 has been allocated to the research budget for the current year.</P>
      <P>The report of the forum also highlighted the problems faced by victims of crime. We must never forget that the victim is at the heart of the crime. I am pleased that my Department is making over £650,000 available to the Association for Victim Support to continue its good work in 1999.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the House of a number of developments which have happened since the report was published.</P>
      <P>The report stresses the need to prevent young people from getting caught up in the cycle of crime. This year will see a major expansion in the network of Garda special projects funded by my Department, which will increase the number of these projects from 14 to 24. These innovative projects are becomingly increasingly important in the context of developments in juvenile justice which involve a partnership approach between State agencies, the voluntary sector and the community to tackle the multiple problems faced by young people deemed at risk of getting in trouble with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also recently made arrangements to introduce a voluntary, national age card scheme which will greatly strengthen the existing <Col N="1509" /> measures aimed at curbing the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age. When the regulations come into operation, any person who has attained 18 years of age will be entitled to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station. The introduction of a national age card will make a significant contribution to the continuing fight against underage drinking.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is also being provided to the Probation and Welfare Service to develop intensive probation programmes for young adults in the 15-18 age group. These schemes aim to reduce reoffending in the context of community based sanctions imposed by the courts. This project, which will be managed by an interdepartmental group, is a practical example of two key themes of the report &ndash; the need for an integrated approach to crime prevention, and the desirability of creating a range of non-custodial sentencing options for young offenders.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that progress is well under way in the setting up of the independent courts service, which is welcomed in the report.</P>
    <P>I also recently announced the composition of the drug courts planning committee. It will be charged with putting in place the arrangements necessary for convening a pilot drug courts project in the District Court. This marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and again it recognises the need for the courts to have a wide range of options for dealing with certain categories of persons entering the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I have also recently announced an investment of £6 million in a computer-based information programme which, for the first time ever, will provide accessible information about the people who pass through our prisons and will eventually expand the potential research base in the prison system. I had called for such information to be made readily available for many years when I was in Opposition and I am pleased now to be delivering on this important commitment which also comes at a time of radical change for the prison system &ndash; the operation and administration of which will shortly be taken over by a Prisons Authority. The programme has three objectives: (i) to address the lack of accessible information about prisoners; (ii) to provide management with the information and tools to manage human and financial resources; and (iii) to enable the automation of many existing functions. These initiatives will contribute to the better management of the prison system which I know the report of the crime forum would endorse.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 106 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> I am sure that I can speak for all Members of the House when I state that violence against women and rape, in particular, is an abhorrent crime. The increase in reported rapes seems to be due to a higher incidence of rape in the present day, historic cases from previous years being reported in the present day, or increased willingness on the part of victims to report rape and the availability of better services for victims.</P>
    <P>This Government recognises that to tackle these particular crimes requires a concerted effort from various sectors in society including the State, semi-State, and non-Governmental organisations. This Government has put in place the structures for coherent policies to develop and is addressing a wide variety of issues by raising awareness of these crimes and working together to ensure a better and safer society for women.</P>
    <P>The National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women is developing a programme of initiatives to make more people aware of the issues of rape and sexual assault. The committee has launched a public awareness campaign, entitled Going Forward, which aims to highlight a number of issues including the central message to victims that help is available. The campaign will be broadened in a subsequent phase, to develop messages to the perpetrators that this is a crime and it must stop and to the public generally not to condone such actions by alienating victims further. The committee is also looking at ways of developing a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary and cohesive response to victims.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware I have published a discussion paper on the law and sexual offences on which I invited the public to make contributions. I can assure you that I will, in the preparation of any new legislation in this area, take these views into consideration. I have also indicated that I support the concept of separate legal representation for rape victims and I will be shortly bringing a memorandum to Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>We are funding research into why there are high rates of attrition in bringing prosecutions in rape cases. The research will examine, on a step by step basis, the obstacles rape victims encounter before coming into contact with, and as they progress through, the criminal justice system. The Garda are also continuing their research on rape which will run in tandem with this project, The results of both of these projects will enable the system to respond better to the needs of the victim.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will appreciate that no previous Government has ever put in place such a multi-faceted and comprehensive response to the many aspects of these heinous crimes.</P>
    <P>The first report of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women will be published in early March and it will outline the Government's policies in this area further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the First National Report of Ireland, prepared in 1996, sets out the position on the protection afforded under Irish law to the rights guaranteed by the convention. The first report was prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs in co-operation with all Government Departments who deal with child-related matters.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, a range of legislative measures has already been put in place to facilitate implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Legislation in place before publication of the convention included: the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964; the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976; the Age of Majority Act, 1985: the Status of Children Act, 1987; Censorship of Films Acts, 1923-1992; and the Video Recordings Acts, 1989 &ndash; 1992, Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929-1967; Criminal Law Evidence Act, 1992; the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989; and the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>Specific legislative measures implemented after publication of the Convention include the Maintenance Act, 1994, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, the Children Act, 1997 and the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996 provides for procedures to safeguard the interests of unaccompanied children who arrive in Ireland and may or may not be asylum seekers. Section 18 of the Refugee Act, 1996 provides for family reunification and makes specific provision for children under 18 years of age. Although the above mentioned sections of the Act have not been commenced &ndash; along with most of the Act, it must be said &ndash; the State seeks to operate to the principle of these sections where possible.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to review the Refugee Act this year and I can assure the Deputy that any new or amended refugee legislation will, of course, continue to take into account the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 also makes a positive contribution to the recognition of the principle of common parental responsibility for children. This legislation, which came into operation on 3 December 1998, gives an entitlement to 14 weeks leave for both parents, in accordance with certain conditions, which is not transferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> The Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998, which is currently awaiting Second Stage in Dáil Éireann, will give the force of law in the State to the 1996 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children. That Convention is expressly intended to build on the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>In the context of Article 18 of the Convention, my Department has, in co-operation with the EU, developed a two-year Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme. This programme, which I launched in July 1998, involves expenditure of approximately £6 million and is aimed at developing childcare facilities to assist parents to reconcile family and working responsibilities and focuses particularly on the provision of those facilities in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I launched the report of the Expert Working Group on Childcare, which was established under Partnership 2000. An inter-departmental committee, chaired by my Department, is being set up to consider the recommendations of the Expert Working Group on Childcare and other recommendations which have been made in relation to childcare and will report to the Government within six months.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that arrangements are in place whereby the Garda Síochána carry out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advices received in the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for a general policy review of the Garda clearance arrangements which will take into account the recommendations of the report of the Expert Group on Childcare in respect of Garda clearance for candidates for employment in posts involving substantial access to children, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention require State parties to protect children against all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic in children for any purpose. Existing Irish legislation meets our obligations under these articles. However this legislation is kept continually under review and any amending legislation will be brought forward in the usual way. Article 40 deals with aspects of juvenile justice and the Children Bill currently before the House is relevant in this regard.</P>
    <P>A revised Equal Status Bill is being developed by my Department. The revised legislation, which is likely to be enacted during 1999, will be a comprehensive measure to tackle discrimination in our society in the non-employment sphere.</P>
    <P>A committee to monitor and coordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community was established in June 1998. The committee, which is chaired by my Department, includes representa<Col N="1514" /> tives of traveller interests, each of the four pillars in Partnership 2000 and relevant Government Departments. It will serve as a forum for consultation on current issues of national importance affecting the traveller community and will draw up and submit to Government periodic progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force.</P>
    <P>Measures have also been taken to provide for the best interests of children who are giving evidence in court, most significantly provisions, both legislative and practical, for the giving of evidence by way of a live television link. In addition, a range of information booklets for child witnesses and their parents or guardians have been published. These booklets explain what happens at court and try to allay any fears or apprehensions child witnesses and the parents or guardians might have about the child's attendance at court. Further measures are under consideration in this regard.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Bill, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas will also require a fundamental change in the way children are imprisoned. It will be necessary to segregate such prisoners (i.e. of 16 and 17 years of age) from adults and this will require the provision of dedicated secure detention centres for children.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I have made £60,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the Institute in the context of its training programme. In addition, I understand that the benches of the various courts hold meetings to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also say that under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the <Col N="1515" /> maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application.</P>
    <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission. Action has already been taken on a number of its recommendations. For example, the Criminal Law Act, 1997, abolished the penalties of penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report specifically recommends against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Other recommendations contained in the report are being considered at present. Any proposals which may emerge from this examination will be announced in the usual way. Finally, the report pointed up a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ability of persons to monitor Garda radio communications by means of scanners and similar devices has been a security concern of the Garda Síochána for some time.</P>
      <P>The current Garda radio network is not one, single integrated system but rather a number of distinct radio communications systems that are interlinked to varying degrees. They can be categorised into four broad system types: the &ldquo;provincial system&rdquo;, i.e., the system used outside Dublin; the Dublin metropolitan area system; the Cork system; and special services systems for national organised groups.</P>
      <P>Of these four, only the Cork system and the special services systems offer the Garda Síochána secure, encrypted radio communications.</P>
      <P>However, as the special services systems are based only on <i>ad hoc</i> systems rather than network arrangements, the only part of the radio network that offers secure communications is the Cork system, primarily because, during the preparation of its specification, the requirement for encryption was included from the start. However, even here, because the transmission system in use by the Garda Síochána is based on analogue technology, encryption on the Cork system has resulted in some, foreseen degradation in voice quality.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, providing secure radio communications for the force in effect means providing encrypted radio communications. From a technical perspective, the current Garda radio network, based as it is on analogue technology, does not provide a ready means of encrypting Garda communications. Hence, it is necessary, to all practical intents, to have in place a digital system of radio communications before encryption and, hence, security can be made readily available.</P>
      <P>With this and other considerations in mind, I recently secured the approval of the Government to replace the existing Garda radio network with a new digital system. The new system is not only based on digital technology but, more than this, it is based on the TETRA standard. TETRA, which is an acronym for Terrestral Trunked Radio, was developed as a standard under a mandate from the European Commission and uses some of the technologies developed for GSM mobile phone systems, but enhanced to meet the requirements of emergency services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> Hence, the new Garda radio network will not only provide secure communications on a nation-wide basis, but will have at its core a standard developed specifically for public safety organisations.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the new digital network will offer a number of other significant operational benefits to the Garda Síochána. For example, the centralisation of the Garda call-taking and dispatch function that will be facilitated by the new digital network will greatly reduce the manpower and other resources necessary to respond to calls for service. This, of course, will have the corresponding benefit of allowing a more dynamic and responsive deployment of Garda resources to areas of most need in the community.</P>
    <P>Other note-worthy advantages of the new network will be a reduction in time-consuming manual procedures, such as recording on paper alarm activation outcomes, as well as enabling enhanced information capture arising from the more focused training of Garda personnel in any centralised system of call taking and dispatch. Moreover, the greater quantity and quality of management information generated by the new TETRA network will provide Garda management with an enhanced overview and correspondingly greater level of control over operations.</P>
    <P>In sum, the new digital system will allow the Garda Síochána to impart a more professional and proficient service to the general public. Indeed, such are the benefits of TETRA-based systems that I understand that many of the main European police forces plan to replace their existing radio communications network with TETRA-based systems in the coming few years, and so the Garda Síochána will be at the forefront of exploiting this new technology. The new Garda radio network will be introduced on a phased basis over the period 2000 to 2003, at an estimated cost of £75 to £85 million. To facilitate this ambitious replacement programme, a pilot trial of the new TETRA technology will commence this year, and the lessons learned will be usefully applied in the national replacement programme.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated, therefore, that the Garda Síochána will enjoy secure, encrypted communications on an incremental basis over the next four years or so, culminating in a fully secure, integrated and nation-wide system of radio communications by the end of the year 2003.</P>

      <P>The prosecution of offences <Col N="1518" /> and the preparation and presentation of prosecution cases are functions which are prescribed in law on the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). As the Deputy will appreciate the DPP is independent in the discharge of his statutory duties.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the length of time between the reporting of an alleged rape and any possible future court proceedings is determined by a number of factors. Under the Criminal Law Rape (Amendment) Act, 1990, section 10, all charges of murder, rape and serious sexual assault must be tried by the Central Criminal Court. which sits at the Four Courts. Until 1996 there were only two judges hearing cases in the Central Criminal Court, but since December 1998 there have been four judges available to hear cases in this court.</P>
      <P>There are currently 130 rape cases returned to the Central Criminal Court for hearing. This represents a significant increase on previous years and, while this figure represents an increase in the incidence of rape, it is also explained by an increased willingness on the part of victims to report crimes. In other words, it is necessary to bear in mind, in looking at recent rape statistics that a number of historic cases are included amongst them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are two relevant research projects currently under way. One project under the auspices of the Garda research unit will, <i>inter alia</i>, give us more information on how rape cases are investigated and handled by the Garda Síochána and another one which my Department has commissioned will give us information, from the victim's perspective, on what the obstacles are which may deter an individual from reporting rape or from progressing through the system to court.</P>
      <P>There are, at present, three trial lists operating in the Central Criminal Court. List one deals with cases requiring the use of video link systems and the average delay is around 11.5 months. In November last year an additional courtroom and video link unit was provided in the Four Courts and I expect that this will contribute to reducing waiting times further.</P>
      <P>The second list deals with cases not requiring video link units and the approximate waiting time is 11 months. These cases have a definite date for that set and a factor taken into account is that the accused is already in custody. List three comprises cases given a provisional trial date and is operated around the availability of judges and are cases which can be heard if other cases are finished prematurely due to various factors such as guilty pleas, etc. The average length of waiting times in these instances is approximately 7.5 months.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, other factors which can have an influence on or contribute to delays in cases reaching court such as the availability of witnesses, prosecution and defence counsel.</P>

      <P>In July 1998, I established a national consultative committee on racism and <Col N="1520" /> interculturalism. The committee is a partnership of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, State agencies, social partners and Departments and has met on four occasions since its establishment. The objective of the committee is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against racism and to advise the Government on matters relating to racism and interculturalism.</P>
      <P>The committee will also endeavour to promote a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as refugees, travellers and other minority ethnic groups in Ireland. A sum of £21,000 was provided to the consultative committee to fund its programme of activities in 1998 and an allocation of £90,000 has been provided in 1999. The committee has also been provided with office premises and facilities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As part of its strategy, the consultative committee will pursue three levels of action: strategic action at national level mainstreaming the commitment and expertise so as to address racism in policy making and implementation measures by Government and into the approach and concerns of other relevant institutions; support for anti-racism measures at EU level, and provision of support to projects at local or regional level in the development of anti-racism initiatives which are consistent with the approach and aims of the consultative committee.</P>
      <P>The committee has approved a comprehensive work programme for the first quarter of 1999 which includes anti-racism training for certain civil servants dealing with minority groups, a seminar on the forthcoming human rights commission and submissions, the setting up of a website, arranging a visit by groups from Northern Ireland, the establishment of a refugee and asylum seeker sub-group, round tables on the integration of refugees and on monitoring the Legal Aid Service in the one-stop-shop.</P>
      <P>The committee has linked closely with developments at EU and international level and organised a national round table conference of the EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia last December.</P>

      <P>On 6 January 1999, I announced the names of seven people I was appointing to a steering group tasked with implementing the recommendations in relation to the reorganising of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities which are contained in the report on the council furnished by consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their terms of reference the steering group <Col N="1522" /> was required to promote the development of the county networks and improve communications between the head office of the council and the networks; in consultation with the membership in the networks, to produce a draft constitution for a permanent council of people with disabilities. The draft constitution will have regard for the need for the council to be inclusive and accountable; to hold a meeting to adopt the constitution; to hold elections to the county networks and to the national board of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities; to oversee the operation of the head office of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, including the allocation of funding to the networks, pending the election of a permanent council, and to complete its task by 30 September 1999.</P>
    <P>Having regard to their terms of reference, it is a matter for the steering group to determine when elections to a new council should be held. Before this can happen, however, it will be necessary for the steering group, in consultation with the membership in the networks, to produce a draft constitution for a permanent Council of People with Disabilities. The draft constitution will have regard to the need for the council to be inclusive and accountable. I understand that the intention of the steering group is that the elections to the permanent council would be held well in advance of September 1999.</P>

    <P>Due to the very wide spectrum of cases and the considerable backlog of applications which I inherited on taking office as Minister, it is difficult to identify an average time from start to finish of the asylum determination process which would have any real meaning.</P>
    <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that by the end of 1998, all applicants who had sought asylum in this State before January 1997 had been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview, first stage determination of asylum applications follows within a matter of weeks of the substantive interview in most cases. By July 1999 it is expected that all applicants who lodged a claim in 1997 will have been interviewed or offered an interview.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously the task force which I put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with a mixture of new and old applications. At the current rates of progress and based on current application figures, I am advised that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of appli<Col N="1523" /> cations by July 2000 and from that date will be processing applications within weeks of arrival.</P>
    <P>A total of 305 deportation orders were signed in 1998 and referred to the Garda authorities for enforcement. A number of these relate to rejected asylum applicants and asylum applicants dealt with under the Dublin Convention. A total of 86 persons subject to such orders left the State voluntarily during the period, one of which was a 1998 asylum applicant. A total of 64 persons were deported on foot of the deportation orders, 11 of which were 1998 asylum applicants removed under the provisions of the Dublin Convention. A further five orders relate to Dublin Convention cases currently the subject of judicial review. The whereabouts of many of those subject to deportation orders is unknown and it is likely that they have left the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The expert group on the Probation and Welfare Service in its first report, published on 2 November 1998, made a number of recommendations as follows: that there should be an increase in staff numbers and that staff recruitment be streamlined; that the service should develop a PR strategy; that an up-to-date IT system must be established; that a staff training <Col N="1524" /> analysis be carried out; that comprehensive research facilities should be available within the service, and that insurance cover regulations for community service projects be changed.</P>
      <P>In relation to staffing matters, the following is the position. The actual number of staff serving at present is 188. There are 18 vacancies for permanent staff at present. Twelve of those vacancies are currently filled by appointing temporary unestablished Probation and Welfare Service officers on a contract for six months. It is hoped to fill the remaining six vacancies by the appointment of temporary unestablished Probation and Welfare Service officers. The Civil Service Commission is currently recruiting staff to enable the permanent positions in the Probation and Welfare Service to be filled in the first half of 1999. As regards the additional 65 Probation and Welfare Service officers and the ten other senior staff and clerical support staff recommended in the expert group's report, my Department is considering the recommendation made by the expert group, in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In relation to providing a comprehensive public information and awareness programme, the Deputy will agree that much of the excellent work done by the Probation and Welfare Service goes unnoticed and I will be looking at how best a public relations initiative can be progressed to promote knowledge about the current and future development for the service.</P>
      <P>As regards an IT package for the service, it has been possible to make progress by putting in place local area networks in the Probation and Welfare Service offices. These are being installed at present and a considerable amount of computer hardware has been purchased. I hope that by the end of 1999 there will be a comprehensive information technology system in place. My Department will also be implementing a comprehensive training programme for the new IT system and will take into account other additional training needs as they arise.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service has a small research unit and when the extra staff and the improved IT system are in place this will allow for the development of more detailed statistics and data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department is financing two research projects as follows: the evaluation of the operation of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, which is currently being carried out under the auspices of the centre for criminal justice under the direct management and supervision of the director of the centre, Professor Dermot Walsh, University of Limerick, and a study on public attitudes regarding the treatment of offenders in the community as part of an ongoing research programme into various aspects of the criminal justice system was recently carried out by the research and evaluation services. The study will form part of the Irish Social Omnibus Survey and was carried out on 1,000 <Col N="1525" /> members of the public. My Department is awaiting this report.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards community service projects and related insurance issues, I inform the Deputy that I will be examining this whole area with a view to providing easier and more cost effective insurance cover for people doing community service work.</P>

      <P>I am naturally disappointed that Kilkenny Textile Mills (KTM) is making 40 staff redundant in its Kilkenny factory. Unfortunately, it comes as a result of competitive pressures from towelling producers in the Far East.</P>
      <P>KTM was established in Kilkenny in 1983 following the closure of Fieldcrest, the US towel producer. KTM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Santens BV, Belgium, a family owned group engaged in the manufacture of terry towelling products.</P>
      <P>On 18 January 1999, Kilkenny Textile Mills announced that, as part of an overall restructuring plan, the company proposes to seek 40 redundancies in its spinning plant. These redundancies are a major blow to the 40 employees concerned. I have asked FÁS to ensure that an appropriate programme is put in place for those who are being made redundant.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Kilkenny area generally, I have been pressing for some time to have additional industries located there. Government policy is directed towards encouraging foreign industries to locate in regional areas and I have again taken the issue of foreign industry for Kilkenny up with the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An infrastructure has now been put in place to attract more investment into Kilkenny. The new 55 acres business and technology park being developed by IDA Ireland in the town is a key part of the strategy to encourage modern businesses in sectors such as information technology, healthcare and international sectors to locate in Kilkenny. A new 25,000 sq. ft. modern advance factory has commenced construction on the new <Col N="1528" /> business park and a 24,000 sq. ft. advance office building will commence construction shortly. Both of these buildings will be strong incentives to bring new business into Kilkenny and they will be important new tools in the IDA's promotion of the location.</P>

      <P>The position in this regard is governed by EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. In accordance with the EU Sixth VAT Directive, schools and other educational establishments are exempt from VAT. This means that such bodies do not charge VAT on the goods and services they supply but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT on their inputs. In this case, therefore, it is not possible to recover the VAT paid in respect of the work carried out on the school. This is the situation which obtains throughout the European Union and it is not open to me to depart from this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the Deputy's question, I would first like to clarify the position generally. All central banks hold foreign currency external assets. Such external assets are held for two principal purposes &ndash; to assist in protecting the currency and to ensure that the country does not lack the foreign currency needed to pay for essential imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the adoption of the single currency, it will be the euro area as a whole rather than individual participating member states such as Ireland, which will need such external assets. Consequently, the ECB is empowered under its <Col N="1533" /> statute to call up, from participating national central banks, up to EUR 50,000 million in foreign reserve assets &ndash; that is, assets in currencies other than the euro. Each national central bank's contribution is in proportion to its shareholding in the ECB, which in turn is in proportion to each member state's shares of the euro area's GDP and population.</P>
    <P>On 4 January 1999, the Central Bank of Ireland transferred EUP, 425 million (£334.7 million) to the foreign reserve assets of the ECB, which is Ireland's share of the ECB's pooled external assets, In return for a claim on the ECB. This contribution represents about 1 per cent of total ECB foreign reserve assets. These assets will continue to be managed by the Central Bank of Ireland on behalf of the ECB.</P>
    <P>The amount transferred represented about 6 per cent of the Central Bank's total foreign exchange assets at end November 1998. As of that date, the latest for which published figures are available, the official external assets held by the Central Bank of Ireland totalled £5,661 million.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank also subscribed EUR 41,92 million, or £33 million, to the share capital of the ECB in accordance with the statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).</P>
    <P>It should be noted that Ireland's share of the ECB's external assets and the capital shareholding will earn income for the Central Bank and thus indirectly for the Exchequer, as the participating national central banks will share the profits of the ECB among themselves.</P>
    <P>This will leave a substantial amount of assets, both euro and non-euro, with the Central Bank of Ireland which are, in the main, matched by counterpart liabilities, which include deposits from financial institutions, etc. and legal tender notes.</P>
    <P>Over the years the bank has in the normal way accumulated accounting reserves as a result of its operations. The value of these accounting reserves may fluctuate, depending on changes in the value of the assets held by the bank. As of the end of November 1998, the latest date for which published figures are available, these reserves stood at £1,191. Surplus income generated,<i> inter alia</i>, by these reserves are remitted annually to the Exchequer as non-tax revenue. In 1999 this is estimated at some £135 million.</P>
    <P>The bank will continue to need external assets of its own, as well as those provided to the ECB, in order to play its part as a member of the European System of Central Banks. The remaining assets will continue as heretofore to be managed by the bank in accordance with risk parameters and benchmarks set by the board of the bank. The aggregate of the national central banks' non-euro assets plus the pooled reserves transferred to the ECB will comprise the foreign exchange reserves of the ESCB.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> At this stage, it is too early to say what will happen to the balance sheet of the Central Bank in the early stages of the single currency. What we can say with certainty is that both the overall level of assets and the accumulated accounting reserves of a central bank contribute to its credibility. For example, adverse exchange rate movements could, in the absence of a sufficient level of accounting reserves to absorb such movements, have negative consequences for the net asset position of the Central Bank. It is not my intention to act in a fashion which could undermine either the credibility or independence of the Central Bank, and indirectly the ESCB, or the credibility of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General as to the legal position of the accounting reserves of the Central Bank. In summary, the advice is that any transfer of the accounting reserves should take place only with the agreement of the Central Bank and, as appropriate, the European Central Bank. The bank and the ECB are the appropriate bodies to determine the level of reserves which are required for the purposes of the monetary policy of the euro area and in order to achieve price stability.</P>
    <P>The contribution which any perceived surplus assets of the Central Bank would make to the Exchequer should not be exaggerated. Assets of the bank earn a return for the bank and the Exchequer receives the surplus income of the bank, thus indirectly benefiting from the bank's reserves. If the assets, corresponding to the accounting reserves, were used by the Exchequer for other purposes, we would be losing the benefit of that income. To the extent that the bank's accounting reserves would be used to reduce the national debt, the net annual benefit to the Exchequer would be the difference between the cost of servicing the repaid debt and the return on the assets in the accounting reserves, i.e. effectively the margin between the interest rates for borrowing and lending.</P>

      <P>Although the Central Bank's role in relation to monetary policy changed significantly with the commencement of stage three of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1999, it is now a full member of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and has assumed all the responsibilities that this implies under the Maastricht <Col N="1535" /> Treaty. The bank actively participates in the policy development and operations of the ESCB, which are implemented on a decentralised basis. As a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, which currently meets twice a month, the governor of the bank is now involved in decision making in respect of the euro system as a whole. The bank is participating fully in the 13 ESCB committees established by the governing council and is also represented on a range ESCB subcommittees, working groups, and taskforces.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector at the earliest date possible and an implementation advisory group has been formed to progress the necessary work. This group will, <i>inter alia</i>, advise the Government on the extent to which, if any, existing regulators, including the Central Bank, would continue to have functions in relation to the regulation of the financial services sector &ndash; and the extent to which any alteration to the status quo would impinge on the non-regulatory functions of the bank. The implementation group, which consists of nine members under the chairmanship of Michael McDowell SC, is to report jointly to the Tánaiste and myself by end February 1999.</P>

      <P>Betting tax does not apply to bets placed on races at the racecourse or track. Instead an on-course levy applies.</P>
      <P>As I announced in my Budget Statement on 2 December 1998, the proposal to cut the betting tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from 1 July 1999 is contingent on new and satisfactory arrangements being put in place by the relevant sectors of the horse racing and greyhound racing industry to replace the on-course betting levy.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House yesterday evening, there is no question of either the paediatric haematology unit at Tallaght being closed or of patients currently undergoing treatment in Tallaght being transferred to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Neither are there any plans to centralise paediatric haematology in Crumlin. As the Deputy will be aware, the only change to the current paediatric oncology and haematology services will be that in future, children diagnosed with cancer, as distinct from children with other haematology disorders, will be referred for an initial assessment at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I met the chairperson of the organisation CHIILD earlier today. I was accompanied by the chairperson of the National Cancer Forum and officials from the Department together with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.</P>
      <P>I certainly understand CHWD's concerns and I reassured the representatives that there would be no transfer of resources, whether equipment or staff, from the new unit at Tallaght. The decision made regarding cancer treatment will also not affect current services being provided for children at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to the chairman of the National Children's Hospital setting out my desire for a structured collaboration between the three Dublin children's hospitals. In this context, I feel that it should now be possible to develop a positive agenda for improvement of paediatric services to which each hospital can subscribe.</P>
      <P>I again emphasise that primacy must be given to the best interests of our sick children, including those requiring oncology and haematology services.</P>

    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery <Col N="1538" /> waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and University College Hospital, Galway, will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels on completion of these developments are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital, to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list and I am also confident that it will have a positive impact for patients on the cardiac surgery waiting list from the North-Eastern Health Board area. The impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting adults and children at the end of September 1998 by 349. This represents a reduction of 22 per cent on the figure for September 1997.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, this Government has provided significant additional resources for the nursing home subventions scheme. Over £17 million was provided for the scheme in the Estimates for 1998. Additional funding of £6.9 million was provided in the Supplementary Estimate for 1998.</P>
      <P>A further £9 million was allocated to health boards this year to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, increased demand for nursing home subventions, the additional costs arising from increased dependency levels and the change in the regulations which applies from 1 January 1999. This regulation removes the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent. The cost of this change alone is estimated at about £2 million per annum. The additional funding provided this year brings the total amount of funding available for the scheme to £33 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget allocation for older people includes a sum of £1.45 million which will enable a new 50-bed community nursing unit at St. Clare's, Ballymun to be opened this year, together with a new 27-bed unit in Clonmel. In addition, the full year costs of contracting an additional 65 nursing home beds is being allocated to the Eastern Health Board, which will help to alleviate the <Col N="1540" /> pressure on acute hospital beds in the major general hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The need to develop better health and other support services for older people is regarded as a priority by this Government. An indication of our commitment to improving services for older people during our term of office can be seen in the fact that we have doubled the capital allocation to services for older people, from £7 million in 1997 to £14 million in 1998. New community nursing units are under construction at Achill and Killybegs. Another important aspect of the capital programme is to replace old, unsatisfactory accommodation with new, modern facilities and such work has started, or is being planned, at locations such as Birr, Cavan and Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative identified the long-term inappropriate occupancy of approximately 3.3 per cent of the total number of acute hospital beds available as a factor in compromising the efficient throughput of elective surgical patients and, as a result, increasing waiting lists and waiting times for individual specialities.</P>
    <P>Pending the implementation of more comprehensive services for older people and for persons who receive rehabilitation and long-term care in the acute hospital setting, health boards and voluntary hospitals have been requested to make arrangements for the appropriate post-hospital care of such persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked health boards and the voluntary hospitals to consider the following measures: the development of a network of private nursing home places, as satellite step-down facilities, around each acute hospital. It is envisaged that acute hospitals would, under the waiting list initiative, make arrangements with such nursing homes, by way of service agreements, to provide appropriate convalescent care to persons discharged from the hospitals. Hospitals would have access to an agreed number of places in the nursing homes and would have control over the persons admitted to these places; acute hospitals to be supported by district care teams, which would provide out-reach support services to persons discharged, either in step-down facilities or in their own homes. The teams would be comprised of relevant healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists; occupational therapists, home helps and general practitioners and would be co-ordinated through the health board community care arrangements and the role of district hospitals in the catchment area of the acute hospital should be maximised. I am confident that these measures will help to alleviate the pressure on acute hospital beds.</P>

      <P>At present, a person seeking to become a nurse may apply for a place in one of three pre-registration nursing and education training programmes general, psychiatric or mental handicap nursing.</P>
      <P>However, following successful completion of such a programme and registration with An Bord Altranais, a nurse may choose to undertake a variety of post-graduate courses, such as midwifery and paediatrics. There are also programmes of post-registration education in care of the elderly. These courses vary in content and in their academic award, up to a masters degree in gerontological nursing.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to restructure nurse training to facilitate a direct qualification in gerontology as such a change was not recommended by the Commission on Nursing.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Nursing considered that care of the elderly offers substantial opportunities for nurse led services. It recommended that schools of nursing, in conjunction with their associated third level institutes, develop nurse education programmes to meet the needs of nurses working in care of the elderly, which would facilitate greater integration among the disciplines of nursing. This recommendation will be addressed in the context of the development of the clinical career pathways advocated by the commission.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers. I am aware, however, that some health agencies run &ldquo;back to nursing&rdquo; courses for registered nurses who may have been out of the workforce for a number of years.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. These groups and organisations are then responsible for distributing the grant funds amongst the elderly people concerned.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems, including the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was initially allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. This is on top of another £5 million paid on this scheme in 1997. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs <Col N="1546" /> and the overall demands which must be met. It is important to realise that not all applications received under the 1996 and 1997 schemes were funded at a level of 90 per cent. No decision was made by me to change the basis for making awards under the scheme in 1998. Therefore, I am satisfied that the level of funding made available in 1998 was sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again that year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will have been assisted in 1998. This means that since I came into office this Government has spent £10 million on the scheme as opposed to the £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Full details of funding provided to voluntary groups and organisations under the scheme of community support for older people up to and including 1997 are held in the Dáil Library for the information of members. Details of grants paid to groups under the 1998 scheme are currently being compiled and will be available in the Dáil Library shortly.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> The Olympic Council of Ireland's 1998 grant application also sought an amount of £68,000 in respect of the European Youth Olympics to be held in Esbjerg, Denmark in July 1999. The Olympic Council of Ireland subsequently submitted a detailed application to my Department requesting a revised level of funding of £87,665 &ndash; 100 per cent of the estimated cost &ndash; towards the cost of sending 65 athletes and 24 officials to the event. An amount of £26,522 was included in this estimate for gear and clothing.</P>
    <P>Following detailed examination of the application in my Department and consideration by the high performance advisory committee and the Irish Sports Council, I approved a grant of up to £60,000 based on the cost of sending 65 athletes and 24 officials to the Games excluding any amount in respect of gear and clothing.</P>
    <P>The approval of the grant is subject to a report being submitted to my Department subsequent to the Games detailing the full and final cost of participation in the event; the exact events competed in and results of all team members, and a technical report by the Chef de Mission.</P>
    <P>The OCI was informed of my decision on 20 January 1999.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at this stage to say what funding will be allocated to the Olympic Council of Ireland in 1999. The 1999 grant application form will issue to the Olympic Council shortly and I will make a decision on the level of funding to be provided following receipt and consideration of this application.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;high performance&rdquo; is currently used, in particular, in the context of the International Carding Scheme, launched last year for player-athletes. Eligibility for participation in this scheme is determined in accordance with sports specific criteria, e.g. competition results, international rankings, etc., agreed with the individual governing bodies. These criteria will be published with the details of the 1999 carding scheme.</P>
      <P>In the case of other funding to assist bodies in promoting participation in their respective sports, the Irish Sports Council, which considers all such applications, has regard to costs associated with the bodies' administration, coaching and development for their wider membership, including those participating for both competitive and recreational reasons. The council may also have regard to specific costs associated with proposed participation by members of sports bodies at international level, geared to obtaining improved international results, rankings, etc., which would come into the general area of high performance.</P>

      <P>A copy of its strategic plan has been forwarded to the Irish Sports Council by Special Olympics Ireland. The organisation did not apply for funding in respect of strategic planning in 1998, while in 1999 the organisation applied for an amount of £2,530 for this purpose. My Department is considering the 1999 applications from all national governing bodies of sport, including Special Olympics Ireland, having regard to the recommendations of the Irish Sports Council. Decisions on the level of funding to be allocated to these bodies for 1999 will be made shortly.</P>

    <P>I also made an extra grant of £4 million available to primary schools last December to assist schools to develop or improve their libraries. Under the terms of this scheme each primary school was allocated £1,000, with primary schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme allocated £3,170 each.</P>
    <P>A working group is drafting guidelines for schools regarding the expenditure of funds for purchasing books. These guidelines, which will be sent to schools shortly, will be recommending that school authorities consult with the local library service before purchasing books. This should enable schools to avail of the expertise available in the library service on sourcing books and on book retention.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will also recommend a range of information software, interactive books and audio books.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this initiative, in addition to the ongoing system of grants to local authorities, is an important step forward in improving the level of provision in this area.</P>
    <P>The above provisions are aimed specifically at library services in primary schools. These are in addition to the normal funds available for the maintenance of schools and for capital works.</P>
