    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Social partnership has played a hugely significant role in the transformation of Ireland over the past decade in both economic and social inclusion terms. The Government is deeply committed to the process, as exemplified by the latest progress report on Partnership 2000 which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The development of the partnership model has been a priority and this is, perhaps, most clearly illustrated by the wide-ranging and systematic monitoring mechanisms in place and the establishment of the National Centre for Partnership. The further development of the model in the years ahead remains a priority, particularly in terms of deepening partnership at enterprise level but, for that to happen, there must be confidence on the part of all participants that the terms agreed will apply.</P>
      <P>Against that general background, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I met with representatives of IBEC and ICTU separately on 13 September. We conveyed the Government's concern at the apparent willingness of some groups to substitute strikes and industrial conflict for the partnership approach and a corresponding concern that the terms of Partnership 2000 should be honoured fully by all sides. We emphasised that the Government has honoured the terms of the present and previous partnership agreements, especially in the area of public service pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that IBEC and ICTU share the Government's view that social partnership has <Col N="4" /> delivered substantially in terms of employment creation, higher living standards across the board, better public services, and improved public finances.</P>
    <P>In our meeting with ICTU specifically, it was agreed that social partnership is only possible in a climate of trust, based on the honouring of commitments. It was further agreed that, in the present context, developments in any part of the public service cannot be viewed in isolation but will have direct implications for pay and conditions generally, through established relativities. This reinforces the importance of developing a new framework for the management of public service pay in its entirety. My recent address to the National Centre for Partnership was anchored on these points.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed with ICTU that social partnership could evolve to support a continuing improvement in living standards, keeping the benefits of a high value-added, high income and socially inclusive economy. It was further agreed that discussions on the shape of a renewed model of social partnership, to succeed Partnership 2000, would continue. These would include the shaping of a consensus through the forthcoming NESC strategy report, the continuing talks on a new framework for managing public service pay and the radical investment programme set out in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>On the NDP specifically, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I held a final round of consultations with the social partners last week. The consultations were most helpful to all sides and the general reaction was very positive. That in itself holds special importance since the plan will represent an important building block for the next stage of social partnership.</P>
    <P>Regarding the July plenary meeting of Partnership 2000, the main item on the agenda was an overview assessment of progress on social inclusion. The principal areas covered were unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, urban disadvantage, rural poverty and equality issues. Subsequently, the Government and the social partners met in secretariat format on 29 September and will meet again in plenary mode to review overall implementation.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Bruton's question on the National Competitiveness Council, I met with the chairman and a number of members of the council on 13 July. The members briefed me on papers they had prepared on the issues of social cohesion, telecommunications and e-commerce, and skills. This was one of a series of meetings between the council and relevant Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, on 13 September, the competitiveness council published a Statement on Social Partnership which concludes that &ldquo;social partnership has been central to the significant social and economic progress made in Ireland over the past ten years&rdquo;. The council believes it is essential that formal partnership agreements are maintained <Col N="5" /> and has identified a number of issues pivotal to Ireland's international competitiveness which need to be addressed in a new agreement. I share the council's views in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the work programme of the NESC, I understand this will be settled by the council on the completion of its strategy report at the end of this month. The council and the NESF are now sharing premises and support services. I expect that the legislation to place both bodies and their shared support structure on a statutory basis will be published before the end of this session.</P>
    <P>I understand that the report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Change Overview, referred to by Deputy Quinn is the working title for the NESC strategy. I have not sought copies of the various drafts prepared to date and do not propose to do so. The final report will contain the considered view of the social partners and I propose to wait for this considered view.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree his urgings in regard to social partnership would be more persuasive if the Government led by example in regard to partnership? Why has partnership broken down between the Government and the unions representing the nursing profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Court decision is there to be accepted. The nurses asked for a due process when they asked that some of the issues in the nursing commission report should be dealt with by the Labour Court. The Labour Court has made those decisions. I do not wish to answer for the nurses, but, for our part, the Government has honoured the terms of the present and previous partnership agreements in relation to nurses.</P>
      <P>The agreed terms have been applied fully in respect of the public service, including nurses. The outcomes of adjudication through agreed procedures have been accepted by the Government. Modernisation of the public service has been promoted on the basis of partnership. The development of partnership at enterprise level and the associated measures of gain sharing have been accepted by us. Most importantly, discussions have commenced with the public service unions on a new approach to public service pay. Those have been ongoing since the beginning of the year. They have not reached a conclusion but they are proceeding successfully. From the Government's point of view, we have honoured our commitments, especially in the pay area.</P>
      <P>As regards the nurses, I urge the profession to take account of the national interest and to accept what is on offer so that we can all move forward with the new agreement, which is what the Minister for Health and Children said to them last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that one could form the impression that he regards a strike as inevitable at this stage, that the issue is on autopilot until the strike begins and that we <Col N="6" /> have a situation in which the Government acts as if it were not a party to the dispute and were simply a dispassionate observer of an event which could lead to one of the worst human tragedies in recent Irish history in which people will die due to lack of treatment because of this industrial dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, one could not take it from my view that all these matters are automatic. I hold the view Deputy Bruton held a few years ago, that strike action is contrary to Partnership 2000 and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> . There is no need for a strike. I have great respect for the nurses, their work and their integrity, and all their unions have to do is accept what they asked for. They asked the Labour Court to examine the outcome of the nurses' commission and to deliberate on that, and that was done. They received due process, which indicated that the Government should pay according to the outcome, and it accepted that. That is how the matter stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to transfer the Government's attitude to the nurses' strike and apply it to Northern Ireland, would the Government have given up a long time ago trying to find a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland? Is it simply because the nurses are seen as a group, to quote the Minister for Finance, bent on creating national chaos that the Government can take this hands-off attitude? Does the Taoiseach agree that, when there is a 9:1 rejection of a decision or recommendation of the Labour Court, followed by a 9:1 endorsement of strike action, somewhere between both sides communication has broken down and that, at the very least, the nation expects the Government to reopen dialogue with that group of people which so massively rejected the decision of the Labour Court, following due process? Does the Taoiseach agree that, if he and his colleagues were to adopt the same attitude of inevitability and lethargy in respect of Northern Ireland, we would never have made the progress we made on that part of this island? Why can the same sense of commitment not now be brought to this process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not begin to make analogies between Northern Ireland and a dispute in any sector of industrial relations. I will try to give the Deputy the answer which I believe to be the case. The Labour Court issued three main findings on nurses in the recent past. It has spent four years on this and the chairman and his panel recently spent more time on this issue than anything else. In February 1997, 17 per cent of an increase was given to the nurses. The due process stated they deserved it and it was given and was paid for. A Commission on Nursing was established which resulted in another £85 million being granted and paid for. In February 1999 the issue of special allowances arose. That cost £25 million. In August 1999 the process had moved on, with <Col N="7" /> 10 per cent being granted to ward sisters, additional annual leave and a lump sum of £1,250 per person which cost £40 million overall. Through all that, the discussions in the Commission on Nursing continued and they clocked up £50 million in pay costs. In no sense do I believe in taking a hard line in disputes. One must talk and discuss. In this case, that is precisely what we did. The Labour Court finding on nurses' pay of 31 August, together with the earlier finding of February this year on specialists' allowances, and the significant improvements which have already been conceded in overtime payments and incremental credit will cost £110 million this year. The lump sum alone will cost £40 million this year and £70 million a year thereafter. That is on top of the £85 million in February 1997 which is within the same period of this whole programme.</P>
      <P>The combined value of these improvements on an ongoing basis, more than £150 million, equates to 23 per cent on average. It is always wrong to take averages, so I will give the exact figures. When the latest Labour Court finding is implemented, and taking account of the general and special increases, the maximum salary of a staff nurse will have increased by £88 a week, 26 per cent, and that of ward sisters will have increased by £144 a week or more than 37 per cent compared to the rates which applied in 1997. By way of comparison, the CSO index of average weekly earnings for the public sector, excluding health, shows an increase of £43 a week or 11 per cent between December 1996 and March 1999. The February 1997 award provided for special pay increases of 17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government &ndash; and I have supported the figures since we came into Government &ndash; allowed for an increase under the PCW from 3 per cent to about 5.5 per cent. However, at that time there was an increase of 17 per cent in special pay. Significant additional pay costs were subsequently incurred in respect of additional posts and acting allowances. In November last year agreement was reached on national overtime arrangements for nursing grades which I also strongly supported because until then nurses' overtime pay rates were not clear. In February of this year the Labour Court recommended that the locations specialist qualification allowance be increased from £333 to £1,000 for nurses in the specialist area and £1,500 where they have a specialist qualification. Many staff nurses and a significant number of ward sisters benefited from that. At the same time &ndash; a point I made earlier &ndash; the Labour Court recommended significant improvements in the incremental staffing arrangements for temporary staff. The latest offer, if it is taken up, and I hope it will be, will increase the maximum salary of ward sisters from £20,023 or £384 a week before the 1997 settlement to £27,522 or £527 a week, an increase of more than 37 per cent, inclusive of general and special increases. The maximum pay of a staff nurse has increased over the same period of two <Col N="8" /> and half years from £17,747 or £340 per week to £22,339 or £482 a week, an increase of 26 per cent. Public health nurses' salaries have increased by 36 per cent.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the PCW and Partnership 2000 nurses have done very well out of the State. That is what I believe, and that is why we cannot pay any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to what the Taoiseach has put on the record. Is it not extraordinary that, notwithstanding all that the Taoiseach has listed so extensively, the general public and the nurses themselves believe they have a good case and, more to the point, the general public believe there is a crisis in our health service of greater proportions than simply money can solve? If, faced with what the Taoiseach has just read out, there is still a 9:1 rejection and a 9:1 ballot for strike action, surely there is something deeply wrong with our health system. Surely it is time to move this debate beyond the question of money, because clearly money will not solve it, and construct a national forum on our health service to see what will solve it. The Taoiseach would readily agree that as he speaks, and notwithstanding those increases, there are 900 nursing vacancies in the Eastern Health Board alone and many of the graduates who come out of our nurse training institutions immediately emigrate. We therefore have a serious crisis in the health system that requires something more than a sense of inevitability as we drift hopelessly towards the chaos that will undoubtedly happen next week. What new, innovative measure does the Taoiseach propose to avoid that catastrophe and put the health service back on the sound footing it needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in the Deputy's recommendation to proceed in an organised and balanced way. That is why a huge effort went into the report of the Commission on Nursing. Subject to correction, I believe the report contained approximately 202 recommendations of which three have been addressed and the remainder await action. In time they will help all aspects of the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>Given that almost 100 per cent of nurses voted for strike action, they should work on the report of the Commission on Nursing to try to correct matters. We should try to implement the report's recommendations. We have already spent £50 million on the non-pay aspects and we have never said pay was the only issue. It is necessary to deal with all the issues involved, and the Minister for Health and Children and the Government want the nurses to proceed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt with three of the report's recommendations because pay was an issue. The Deputy and I might think the award should not be given and that, based on these figures, the nurses effectively got six times more than the average public service worker, even though they were not behind others, either domestically or <Col N="9" /> internationally. However, I do not wish to argue about that. I put those figures on the record and I do not want to repeat them. The nurses can work on the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Nursing and try to improve the profession.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's argument on the health issue, I used to believe that money would solve the health crisis when there was a crisis. This year £3.5 billion has been spent on health, an increase of 10 per cent on last year. In a short period of time &ndash; I am sure the Deputy agrees that two years and three or four months is a short period &ndash; the Minister for Health and Children has spent £800 million extra on the health service. Comparing like with like over a similar period when the Deputy was Minister for Finance, he sanctioned £400 million, yet the Minister has allocated £800 million. Staffing levels have increased by 6,000. I hope the extra money and staff will have some impact, but I do not believe that is the issue here.</P>
    <P>The nurses had a case and they put it. Three times in the course of a short period they got special attention. They also got special adjudication, which has been sanctioned and ratified. I have the greatest respect for nurses and the nursing profession, but I and my colleagues must take everybody into account. We cannot continue to pay hundreds of million of pounds to one sector while expecting other sectors to quietly acquiesce. The gardaí and bus, DART and local authority workers are now queuing up to take strike action because they accepted a 3 per cent pay increase in the first instance, but then saw a coach and carriage driven through it not once but three times by the nurses. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>If the nurses believe they have got so far but are still aggrieved they can use due process under the aegis of the report of the Commission on Nursing, the new public service pay determination system and the post-Partnership 2000 talks. They can use all or one of these mechanisms to prolong their case, but we cannot give any more and will not during this round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, as he said, it is not all about money and that this dispute is about people? Does he agree it is about patients who will lose their lives if the dispute goes ahead and that, regardless of how they are paid or what has been offered to them, nurses feel they are not being valued as a profession? Does he also agree it is a communications disaster on the part of the Government that the nursing profession is in this state and that nurses do not feel valued and do not feel that the Government is listening to them? They cannot hear the list of statistics the Taoiseach has just given. As people well know in politics, when one is explaining, one is losing and one is certainly losing when one is listing statistics, as the Taoiseach is now doing. Will the Taoiseach agree that personal contact needs to be resumed between the Government and the nursing unions with a view to establishing <Col N="10" /> that the Government wants to resolve the issue and to reach an accommodation, not just on the financial issues but on the valuing issues as far as the profession is concerned, so that nurses will feel they count and that the Government is willing to listen to them?</P>

      <P>As soon as the Labour Court made a determination on 31 August &ndash; that was a Tuesday and the Government met on Wednesday &ndash; out of respect for the nurses and their case, we agreed that morning and by lunch time the Minister for Health and Children was indicating that we were prepared to accept it even though the cost was high. When the Nursing Commission report was published, the Minister tried to ensure that its recommendations were delivered speedily. He was prepared to implement the recommendations and £50 million has already been expended on the non-pay aspects; the pay issue has gone through the Labour Court system. This Government and previous Governments have recognised the value of the nursing profession. This is why they have received substantial increases. Facts were put on the record, not just statistics. There is a view that no one wishes to become a nurse. However, this year there were 5:1 student nurse applications to posts throughout the country. Admittedly, some hospitals are short nursing staff, nevertheless there is a big demand for student nurse places.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work to solve this problem. I am sure Deputies Bruton and Quinn will agree there is no need for a strike. People asked for due process and adjudication, they put a claim forward and this has been paid. There is no outstanding claim because the Labour Court has dealt with the issue. In the normal course of industrial relations since the foundation of the State, it would be difficult for a Government to pay out a claim which has not been made. In this case it was agreed to pay the claim. If there are outstanding issues &ndash; I am not saying that every nurse is happy because almost 100 per cent of them have voted against the Labour Court recommendations &ndash; there are ways of progressing these matters under the new public service pay determination rules and under the next round, which apply also to other sectors who have a grievance. I have to deal with these grievances which Governments do not like, but it is unacceptable, given that special claims were made in 1997, 1998 and 1999, which resulted in far greater increases for one sector, with the Government conceding each time, a claim is rejected and not even put to the membership. This cannot and will not be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the unions sit down tomorrow with the public service management agency workers they will agree the emergency plan if a way of resolving the dispute cannot be found. However, the Government is prepared to work on the outstanding issues in the following context: (a) the new pay determination being discussed with the unions; (b) in the next programme; (c) <Col N="11" /> under the Nursing Commission but not by way of a gun being put to the Government's head. That will not be allowed to happen.</P>

      <P>I have queries relating to the other questions answered by the Taoiseach. On this issue I invite the Taoiseach to consider my suggestion, that is, by his own words he is implying that notwithstanding the substantial amounts of money voted in this House and allocated by the present Government to the health services, the vast majority of people who have direct contact with the health services believe there is a crisis. That is what I am told on the street, in the context of my public encounters, and I suspect this is true also for other Deputies. Let me give specific examples.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the ordinary public is bemused that there are operating theatres in the most expensive hospital the country has ever built lying vacant for lack of staff, that beds and wards have been closed for lack of staff, that the waiting list is still 33,000 or 34,000, a figure which is possibly understated, and that there is something seriously wrong with our health system? Because of this, will the Taoiseach consider my proposal for a forum on the health service and health system we should have, not just a commission on nurses, because quite clearly this problem goes beyond the problems of the nurses, deep and grave though they clearly are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the Deputy's proposal and no doubt he will raise it again with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. However, there are more people being treated today in in-patient, out-patient and elective and emergency services than ever before. There has been an extension of services and an upgrading of equipment. As long as there is somebody on the waiting lists we can say it is a problem or a crisis, but the enormous level of resources that has been put into dealing with waiting lists in terms of initiatives and in dealing with new specialities is growing every year and will continue to grow. We have increased the staffing levels and the professionalism of the service like never before. Funding of £800 million, with 10 per cent this year, in a short period of time is a huge sum of money. The capital programme is enormous. Of course there are still difficulties and members of the public will say this as long as there is someone on any waiting list. However, enormous improvements have been made in the quality, type and standards of our hospitals and I am sure any other question can be directed to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

        <b>:</b> Has the Taoiseach seen figures and statistics which clearly show that <Col N="12" /> since 1987 the process of national agreements has been used to keep wage increases for ordinary workers to minimum levels while at the same time profits, dividends and rentals for private landlords have been allowed free reign to go through the roof? Has the Taoiseach seen figures which show that in terms of percentages there has been a huge transfer in the section of national production going from workers to the business sector and the landlord class? Does the Taoiseach accept that the calls of Government and employers for workers to again set aside demands for realistic pay increases which might make up for what I have outlined carry no authority whatever in view of these facts &ndash; and they are facts? Does he further accept that the Government and employers have no credibility whatever with ordinary workers given that while they were being taken for a ride in this way, while PAYE workers were being tax compliant, some big businesses and senior politicians involved in the Ansbacher conspiracy were further robbing them blind since 1987 through tax fraud and other means, above and beyond the super profits they made as a result of the national deals? Does the Taoiseach seriously believe that workers will take his sermons and those of employers seriously when they talk about tightening their belts further in view of the sad history since 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not engaged in sermons &ndash; it is not in my profession and I would not like to do it. However, the lessons of the 1980s should not be forgotten. I remember the days when there were wage increases of 20 per cent with inflation running at 21 per cent and 22 per cent, but there was nothing in it for workers. The Deputy seems to be again calling for high nominal wage increases. I haven't heard that mentioned by organised labour in Ireland since the 1970s. High nominal wage increases between 1980 and 1987 produced a reduction of about 5 per cent in take home pay for the average worker and employment fell by 6 per cent. The more moderate wage increases since 1987, the period taken by the Deputy, have produced an increase in take home pay of more than 25 per cent for the average worker, while the number employed is more than 500,000. The consensus approach supported by the trade unions and all the political parties in this House during that period led to those successful policies in contrast to the failed policies of the past, none of which I would advocate. I strongly urge people, therefore, to concentrate on what has been achieved in the last decade in considering a post-partnership agreement.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach reflect on what he would think about a private employer who allowed such a wide communications gap to develop between what the employer and the employees saw as the reality, as wide as the gap that has developed between the Government and the nursing profession? Does the Taoiseach agree that whatever about the details &ndash; he has given <Col N="13" /> many details, none of which I dispute, about the various awards and so on &ndash; the gap in perception indicates that genuine partnership may be working in the private sector but it is certainly not working as between the Government and the nursing profession so far as the health service is concerned and that there is something wrong with the system of communication between Government and nurses in hospitals and elsewhere that there is such a radically different point of view between the two sides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be sidetracked but that is what the Labour Court is about. In this case the Government and the nurses held a different view. All the nurses asked was that there be due process. We were reluctant to go to the Labour Court to hear the case for a third time, which it decided on its merits. It came down very much on the side of the nurses and we agreed to pay. There was no other issue or claim. I accept the point on the wider health service issues in respect of which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has paid out £50 million. The Health Service Employers Agency attempted to discuss non-pay issues with the Nursing Alliance. The union side, however, refused to engage until such time as the pay issues were resolved. I can only come to the sad conclusion therefore that it is not, as some Deputies are saying, about the wider health service issues but about pay. This is based on three of the recommendations of the substantive report of the nursing commission. I urge the nursing unions to examine and work through its 1999 recommendations. If connected pay issues arise they can make the claim again, but I cannot defend a situation where all organised workers across the entire public service have been asked to live within the terms of the PCW, some of whom accepted very low increases at the beginning, while another group receives enormous increases. I would readily resolve something that needed to be resolved, but I do not believe paying out more in this instance would be fair to the remainder of the organised community who sup<Col N="14" /> port the social partnership agreement, and I do not have any intention of trying.</P>

      <P>In his reply, the Taoiseach talked about the prospect for a new agreement and referred to the NESC. It is generally conceded that the four agreements we have witnessed since 1987 were coming from a position where we had to solve problems that had arisen. The Taoiseach referred to them earlier. The draft of the NESC report that was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> suggests that a new approach will be needed to reconstruct social partnership. Will the Government put a proposal for a new form of social partnership &ndash; for a new set of priorities that might put together social partnership &ndash; following discussions which might lead to an agreement? If so, when does the Taoiseach propose to outline that? Second, does the Taoiseach think comments from a senior Minister such as &ldquo;Everybody with any half brain&rdquo; or &ldquo;You would want to be a half-wit&rdquo; in relation to industrial relations, is the kind of constructive dialogue that will enhance the quality of the debate, ensuring the arrival of consensus agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will make suggestions. A number of issues are being looked at, including social cohesion, cost, technology, skills and training. I propose that we include those in discussions, after what I hope will be a successful outcome in early November. There are many new concepts that we can look at and many initiatives have been suggested. I am open to discussing them with the social partners. As the Deputy suggested, we should put some of them forward. Some suggestions are coming already from the competitiveness council report which I mentioned in my reply. Others came from the meetings I had with the social partners on 13 September and from meetings I had last week &ndash; and earlier in the summer &ndash; on the national development plan. Agreeing a new social partnership programme, and the need to ensure that it is widely understood, is very important. Looking at initiatives as part of that process, as the Deputy has mentioned, is also important, and I support that.</P>

        <b>:</b> I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on his error in blaming inflation in the 1970s on workers' wage demands when wage demands were chasing massive price increases, for which workers were not responsible, given that many of the influences were imported. Will he address the issue of credibility of Government <Col N="16" /> and employers, which he signally failed to do in my previous question? Does he accept that in the minds of the nurses there are bitter memories of the major cuts in the late 1980s and of the tax amnesty, which the Taoiseach awarded to the millionaire tax dodgers, which were responsible for severe cuts in the health services? Does he also accept there is a major question over the Government's credibility in that he is trying to hold back the nurses? Will he address the disparity of national income going to big business as opposed to workers as a result of agreements? Will he agree, in particular, that when the Government is seeking a new agreement, the level of private rented accommodation and house prices should be frozen if workers are to be asked to make further sacrifices on wage increases? What does he say to low paid workers about this? Does he think that home helps on £3 an hour should be restricted for the next ten years while employers massively increase their profits?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that public representatives in Galway were contacted by senior authorities in Portiuncula Hospital today and told that that hospital, effectively, will be closed down if the strike goes ahead at the weekend and virtually all the current patients will be removed from the hospital? If that happens in Portiuncula Hospital, which is an advanced hospital, it will happen elsewhere. The results of this will be truly devastating for families. I do not say this in a critical way. I know the Taoiseach is as concerned as everybody else, perhaps more than most, about the crisis we are facing, but I wonder does the House really appreciate the seriousness of the crisis we will face in the next week, a crisis that will be lasting in its effects. Surely something can be done to find a breakthrough in this before a strike starts. If nurses appear on the picket line outside hospitals, it will be harder to get them back in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Bruton was being constructive in the way he put his point. It is of major concern to the Government that nurses would withdraw their excellent services. We do not wish them to do that. For months during this year we have endeavoured to assist them in every way we could. The only way we could do that was pay them practically everything that was requested and we did that. We have honoured every agreement and arbitration, but we have come to the bottom line. I am repeating myself on this. We accepted the Labour Court's award, but it was thrown out with the click of a finger and considered to be of no use. Some said that the £37.5 million and the £1,250 was an insult. It certainly was not meant that way. All we did was accepted the Labour Court award and agreed to pay the £150 million in a very short period. The <Col N="17" /> elderly and those who are not well will suffer as a result of a strike, and we do not want that to happen. It does not matter what I believe, the way around it is for the nurses to accept the Labour Court award and continue to follow what they believe are their legitimate claims &ndash;  not to do as they are doing at present. There are well tried and tested ways of dealing with industrial relations, but they are not being followed in this dispute.</P>
      <P>As regards the point made by Deputy Joe Higgins, I said the lessons of the 1980s should not be forgotten when high nominal wage increases between 1980 and 1987 caused a reduction of 5 per cent in take home pay for the average worker and employment fell by 6 per cent. Against that, when moderation was practised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, affiliated unions and employers, take home pay went up by 25 per cent and employment rose to more than 560,000. Services increased, taxes at 65 per cent, which were penal 12 or 14 years ago, came down to 46 per cent and 26 per cent. The bands have widened and services have improved. Things are better for workers and employers are making money. The Deputy and I will not agree on this, but I do not have a problem with an employer making money if he employs somebody. I would rather see him using his money to create employment than hiding it away in an Ansbacher account.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is a key priority in An Action Programme for the Millennium that centrally organised State services will be decentralised to ensure that each region gets its fair share of national expenditure on Government administration. I was of the view that the decentralisation of the head office of the Legal Aid Board to a small rural centre would serve as an earnest of the Government's intention of honouring its commitment in this area. On 16 July last I submitted the proposal in principle to the Government that the head office of the Legal Aid Board be decentralised to Cahirciveen.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the Government's decision on 21 July, I immediately informed the Legal Aid Board of the decision and subsequently had discussions with the chairperson and chief executive of the board and with representatives of one of the unions concerned. Discussions involving senior management and staff of the board, officials of my Department and of the Department of Finance, which are ongoing, are aimed towards the smooth implementation of the transfer which will require careful planning to ensure continuity and quality of service.</P>
      <P>The reason I did not consult the board in advance is that it was not possible to anticipate the Government's decision in the matter. If I had proceeded with prior consultation with all the parties concerned, including the Legal Aid Board, and it transpired that the Government was not prepared to entertain the proposal, then consultation would have been clearly seen to be inappropriate. As regards publication of the impact assessment report, the board has indicated it is prepared to have the report published.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support decentralisation which has been successful. However, this is the wrong office for decentralisation and the issue has been wrongly handled. Why did the Minister not have the decency or courtesy to consult the board in advance of announcing the decision to move the board and its employees 222 miles to the other end of the country? Does he not realise that consultation with the staff in advance is always part of decentralisation? Does he realise the annoyance and anger his gauche ham-fisted <Col N="19" /> handling of this issue has generated among the staff?</P>

      <P>As regards the wild claim by the Deputy that staff will be moved more than 200 miles, no member of the staff will the requested to move against his or her will. The redeployment of staff to Cahirciveen will occur throughout the Civil Service and will be on foot of an individual's choice. In addition, consultations will and have been taking place with the various interested parties to ensure a smooth transfer. There were other decentralisations in the past and I am not aware of previous consultations taking place prior to those occurring.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister take into account when making his decision that there was a 23 month waiting list for the Newbridge law centre, a 22 month waiting list for the South Mall law centre in May and other long waiting lists throughout the country? Did he consider that the board was already experiencing difficulties in recruiting solicitors and that it was trying to extend the private practice system around the country? The board was seriously concerned about a number of issues and this House consistently raised the issue of waiting times for law centres. Surely it was an inappropriate time to disrupt the work of the Legal Aid Board? The response of the board indicates it was a seriously disruptive action to take. Did the Minister consider those points when making his decisions and putting his proposals to the Cabinet?</P>

      <P>One should not confuse the issue of law centres with the administration of the Legal Aid Board. The Legal Aid Board is concerned with administration and it has been concluded by the impact assessment, which the board sought, that the legal services, finance, organisation, personnel records and administration can be effectively handled from the Cahirciveen office. Deputy O'Sullivan is seeking to confuse the issue of waiting lists and law centres with the administration of the Legal Aid Board, which is disingenuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan would not consider that the 550 jobs which were decentralised to Limerick in 1991 should be brought back to Dublin nor would Deputy Jim Higgins consider that the 100 jobs which went to Ballina from the Department of the Environment and Local Government should be returned to Dublin. If we are to revitalise smaller provincial towns, then we must look at credible means of doing so. Decentralisation is one such way. The small number of <Col N="20" /> jobs in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relative to the Civil Service will have a considerable bearing on the future prosperity of the town concerned. It is part of the programme for Government that such small decentralisations should occur in smaller towns. I ask the Deputies to make their points but not to confuse the issue or use smokescreens to engage in what can only be described as base politics.</P>

Can he not see that it has been rejected out of hand by everyone? It has been rejected out of hand, for example, by the Civil &amp; Public Service Union, which accused him of blatant political expediency, and by the Public Service Executive Union which took umbrage at the Minister's observation that the service could be provided from the moon by remote control. Deputy O'Sullivan's observations about the quality of service being infringed upon do not come from her or me but from officials in free legal aid centres who have said that the consequences will be longer waiting lists and an increased waiting time. How many staff have opted for transfer and how many have declined?

      <P>On 1 April 1999, the latest date for which official figures are available, there were 80 staff with disabilities employed in my Department and associated bodies. This represents 2.4 per cent of the total number of staff serving. These figures exclude the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service which are exempt from Government decisions in relation to the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service. In accordance with Government policy, I will of course continue my endeavours to increase the percentage of staff with disabilities to a minimum of 3 per cent of overall staffing levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept it is incumbent on her Department, above all others, to meet Government guidelines and that two and a half years into her Ministry, it is disappointing, to say the least, that the 3 per cent minimum target has not been reached in the staffing levels of her Department? As regards the recent announcement of a clerical officer competition for people with disabilities, will the Minister tell us the number expected to be recruited? Is it expected that people with disabilities will be recruited to other grades in the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance has responsibility for the 3 per cent quota in the Civil Service while my Department has responsibility for the quota in the public service. The Department and the Civil Service Commission announced the recent competition in order to notify people with disabilities of its existence. As regards numbers, Department of Finance officials and other civil servants who attended the official announcement of the competition predicted that more than 100 people could be recruited. However, it is a difficult figure to ascertain and people are guessing as it depends on the number of clerical officer vacancies in the various Departments. The competition was advertised on 28 September. People will be examined through the various mechanisms in November and the results will be issued at the end of January. People with disabilities will be recruited in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission has worked diligently to remove all the barriers involved in applying for these positions. Many people with disabilities may be well able to enter data in a computer. However, the difficulty may be in completing the application form for the job. They can telephone in their application forms and complete the examination through Braille and other mechanisms. It is important to note that people <Col N="23" /> with disabilities can apply for all grades in the Civil Service provided they fulfil the regular entry requirements. They can enter through special panels, which have always existed. However, the focus of the special competition is to send a clear message to Irish people with a disability that we are openly recruiting clerical officers. There are vacancies and we want people with disabilities to fill them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Will the Minister of State reply to my first question? Is it not a profound disappointment that the Department with specific responsibility for equality has not yet reached the minimum targets it has set for recruitment? The Minister of State says it is the responsibility of the Department of Finance. However, although she does not sit at Cabinet, all proposals are equality proofed and the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will ensure Government targets of equality recruitment are met. As regards the Minister of State's responsibility for the public service quota, has there been an audit of public service buildings to ensure all of them are accessible to people with disabilities? Is a report of such an audit available for scrutiny? As regards the clerical officer entrance examination for people with disabilities, why is it not proposed to have a similar examination or recruitment process for other grades?</P>

      <P>The quota has improved in my Department. The figure has increased from 2.2 per cent in October to 2.4 per cent at present. Obviously, all Departments are committed to reaching the 3 per cent quota. The statistics have decreased from 1996 to date. The 3 per cent was achieved in 1994-95 but it was difficult to achieve from 1996.</P>

Previously, for example, if somebody broke their leg three months previously and was using a crutch, they might have been included in the statistics. We got tougher with regard to who could register with the National Rehabilitation Board or come through specific panels to ensure people with a genuine disability were included as distinct from the previous position. Interestingly, that yielded the information that 82 people across the Civil Service were being included who should not have been included.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am not asking the Minister to breach confidence. I am simply asking him to outline the State's position on this. Is it not a fact that the State has decided that the basis of its judicial review should be as follows: that the judge acted beyond his jurisdiction and contrary to natural justice in relisting or procuring the relisting of the case, that it is being argued that <Col N="27" /> the judge in question erred in failing to give adequate notice to the Director of Public Prosecutions or to allow the Garda inspector to address the court&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our legal system, like all common law jurisdictions, is balanced. It consists of checks and balances, hearings and appeals. One of the most fundamental procedures of our law is that of judicial review. This process involves a High Court judge reviewing the action of a district justice. In discussing the position in this case it must be borne in mind that the High Court will decide whether the judge in question acted in accordance with the law and the principles of natural justice. While that review is pending, the matter is clearly <i>sub judice</i> and any comment which might be prejudicial or indicate a judgment having being reached prior to the matter being heard by the court could not but adversely affect the matter. In those circumstances, it must be appreciated that it would be inappropriate for me or anyone else to prejudge the matter. Suffice to say that when the judicial review proceedings have been completed and the report finalised, I will report the matter to the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 294 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Victims' Commission, &ldquo;A Place and a Name&rdquo;, was published on 5 August. <Col N="28" /> As this is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the House on this matter since publication of the report I express my appreciation to the former Tánaiste, John P. Wilson, for his efforts in compiling it and for the understanding approach he adopted in meeting victims of violence and their relatives and in addressing their concerns. The confidence which all sides of the House expressed in Mr. Wilson has been well repaid. He is a most distinguished former politician and, dare I say, statesman and he has done an excellent job for us.</P>
    <P>As regards implementation of the recommendations in the report, it states that a period of three months after publication should be allowed for responses to it from interested parties. Following such consultations an outline implementation plan should be produced within a further three months. In keeping with this recommendation, I invited interested parties to send their comments on the report to my Department by 5 November. At that stage I will bring proposals to Government regarding implementation of recommendations. This will take full account of the views expressed in the responses to the report.</P>
    <P>However, two recommendations in the report were of sufficient urgency to warrant action at an early stage and in this regard Deputies will be aware that the Taoiseach announced in the Dáil on 29 September that the Government has decided that an eminent legal person should be appointed to inquire privately into the Dublin-Monaghan and Dundalk bombings and the case of Séamus Ludlow along the lines recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other recommendations in the report I have asked all Departments and public agencies affected by the recommendations to formulate their responses and initiate action, where appropriate, as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that we are still in the first stage of the follow-up to the report, during which interested parties can make a response, and that it will be for the Government to decide on implementation, Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to indicate at this point what action the Government might take in regard to recommendations other than the two I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the extent of public interest, particularly in the Border counties, in his and the Cabinet's response to recommendations in the report? There is also disquiet that the report, while recognising that the displaced &ndash; those forced to leave their homes in the North as a result of fear or threats and who moved to this jurisdiction in large numbers in the early years of the conflict &ndash; have not had their circumstances reflected in Mr. Wilson's recommendations concerning measures that might be introduced to provide monetary compensation. Will the Minister advise if he will reflect their victimhood in his final recommendations? Will he note the concerns expressed this <Col N="29" /> morning by relatives of the late Mr. Séamus Ludlow and those of the victims of the Dundalk and Castleblaney bombings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Dundalk bombings are included in the Government decision regarding the investigation by an eminent person. It is not the intention of the Government, nor was it the intention of Mr. Wilson, to lock the doors on a public inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan or Dundalk bombings. After the investigation has taken place, the report will be published. Following that we will see whether a recommendation is forthcoming to the effect that there should be a public inquiry. The Government will give consideration to that matter at that point. As regards compensation, my understanding is that the report recommends payment to past victims.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> My question is essentially the same as that asked by Deputy Howlin. Why has the Sackville Place bombing not been included in the remit of this eminent legal person? The Dublin-Monaghan bombing was on the same scale as that of Omagh, yet no commemorative plaque has been erected. Will the Government consider erecting a memorial or commemorative plaque to commemorate this tragic event?</P>

      <P>The Government will give consideration to any matter which might bring comfort to the families of the victims in all these cases. The position in regard to other bombings and atrocities is that the Government naturally condemns them. The difficulty is that we had to have terms of reference in asking Mr. Wilson to formulate his report. Equally, on receipt of the report, we had to reach certain conclusions on matters where he made recommendations. The decision of the Government is necessarily confined to certain matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>When I last answered questions in the House about this matter on 1 July the remains of three victims had been located. The remains of these persons &ndash; Mr. Eamonn Molloy, Mr. Brian McKinney and Mr. John McClory &ndash; have since been returned to their families for burial.</P>
      <P>Despite extensive searching, involving the commitment of whatever Garda and other resources were necessary, no other remains were located. I should make the point that those searches generally went considerably further than would have been thought necessary on the basis of the information made available. In other words, all reasonable efforts were made to bring those searches to a successful conclusion. In making this point, I am sure all Members of the House will join me in paying tribute to the excellent work carried out by An Garda Síochána in this regard, not least for the sensitive manner in which they dealt with the relatives who obviously were going through a particularly harrowing time.</P>
      <P>After 49 days of extensive searching an operational decision was taken to suspend the remaining searches and to assess the operation in the light of the information available. Discussions are ongoing between the gardaí and the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains regarding the availability of any further information that would assist in the search for the remains of the victims. Any such information is being and will be assessed to see if it forms the basis for further action on the part of the gardaí. I take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who has information which could lead to the location of victims' remains to make this available to the commission.</P>
      <P>While I do not have available to me the precise number of hours expended by the gardaí to date, and I do not believe there would be any substantial benefit to be gained by collating this information, it is beyond doubt that the necessary resources were made available both in terms of the gardaí and outside assistance to undertake the searches in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Quinn, I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 118 of 28 April 1999, No. 93 of 5 May 1999 and No. 248 of 11 May 1999. As mentioned in the responses to those questions, the remains in this case are those of the late Mr. Séamus Ruddy. Following appropriate consultations, on <Col N="31" /> 23 March 1999 the Irish Central Authority for Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which is part of my Department, forwarded an International Rogatory Commission to the French Ministry of Justice for assistance in locating the remains of Mr. Ruddy. The rogatory commission was issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions at the request of An Garda Síochána. The French Ministry gave approval in principle for the execution of the request on 15 April and, following subsequent contact between the gardaí and the relevant French authorities, a search was carried out on 5 and 6 May 1999.</P>
    <P>The full co-operation of the French authorities was received at all stages and I want to place my appreciation of this on the record of the House. In addition, all possible assistance was afforded by the Irish authorities involved in the matter. An area which had been indicated as the place where the remains in question were located was excavated without success. The initial area of search was then widened and a much more extensive area was excavated, again, unfortunately, with negative results.</P>
    <P>Recently the gardaí have received further information from the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains on the possible location of the remains. This information is currently being evaluated in co-operation with the French authorities so that an agreed strategy for further action may be taken in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is only right to acknowledge again the valuable work being performed by the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in dealing with this very difficult issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask a number of supplementaries together for brevity. First, what specific efforts have been made by the Minister and his Department since the cancellation of the former searches to locate the bodies of victims? Second, what specific contacts and supports have been offered to the families of the victims to assist them during this traumatic and difficult time? Third, will the Minister give us his opinion as of now on his evaluation of the bona fides of the original information by the IRA on the location of victims? Fourth, is there any proposal to further amendment to the Criminal Justice (Location of Victims' Remains) Act, 1999, consequent on what we now know?</P>

      <P>At this point there are no proposals to amend the 1999 Act. In regard to whether I accept that the information was given in good faith, I have said before in this House that it would appear to me that the information was given in good faith. Obviously time may have dimmed some people's memories but I have made it clear again and again that if people have further information they should, in all humanity, bring forward that information to enable us to continue with any searches which may be deemed appropriate on foot of the information being <Col N="32" /> given to us. The difficulty is that the further information we require&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have said, any information which is brought to our attention will be acted on. The searches earlier this year obviously went considerably further than would have been thought necessary on the basis of the information which was made available. In other words, all reasonable efforts were made to bring those searches to a successful conclusion. If there is new information in the possession of the Garda Síochána it will be carefully evaluated with a view to assessing if further searches would have a reasonable prospect of success, but the House will appreciate that given the disappointments many of the relatives have experienced in relation to the searches which have taken place, it would be wrong for any of us to say anything at this stage that might yield unrealistic hopes but I can say&mdash;</P>

Will the Minister give a commitment that unremitting pressure will be put on those members of the IRA who were responsible for those murders, some of whom ordered them and at least one of whom is now in a leadership position in Sinn Féin? May I join also in the praise the Minister gave to the Garda authorities?

We have made it clear on a number of occasions at various levels of Government that it would be in the interests of everybody if people <Col N="33" /> who have further information would make it available. Obviously, any such information would be utilised in accordance with the legislation now on the Statute Book and we must again remember the harrowing time being experienced by relatives of the victims. I met some of the relatives some time ago who are going through a great deal of distress and trauma, and it was truly a heart-wrenching experience.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on a judicial decision. The circumstances surrounding this case, however, are a source of concern to me given that the video link facility is such an essential element in the hearing of these very sensitive cases. Accordingly, I decided at the time to initiate an immediate and urgent review of the video link capacity which is available in our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this case came before the Circuit Criminal Court last July, there were four courtrooms in the Four Courts fitted for video link trials. Three of these courtrooms have jury facilities which are necessary for trials of this nature. Unfortunately, one of these courtrooms could not be used because of technical difficulties which have since been rectified. The other two courtrooms were in use. Court No. 16 was being used for a High Court sitting on the day in question. Court No. 12 was not suitable for use as a jury courtroom as both the courtroom and the jury room were in use for the storage of documents relevant to a lengthy civil case which was ongoing in that courtroom. I am informed that this is not a usual situation but had been approved by the civil trial judge who is responsible for the conduct of the trial and all aspects of it. It is perhaps less than ideal that a judge did not have convenient alternative accommodation available to him. My Department has been in contact with the chief executive officer designate of the Courts Service and I have been assured that steps are being <Col N="34" /> taken to address the current situation and to ensure that there is no repetition of these events.</P>
    <P>As a result of the review I initiated, I am pleased to inform the House that two additional courtrooms with jury facilities have now been fitted out to hear video link cases. This brings the total number available to six. I am also arranging for the necessary staff to be in place to supervise and generally look after the witnesses who will be using these additional facilities. In addition, my Department is considering the possibility of extending the video link facility to a number of provincial locations. I assure the House that this matter will be kept under regular review to avoid a repetition.</P>

      <P>Section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996, makes provision for fingerprint data to be gathered from asylum seekers over 14 years of age. This provision, which brings this country into line with other EU member states, was included by way of amendment to the Refugee Act, 1996, as part of the Immigration Act, 1999. Work is under way on the preparation of the necessary regulations and arrangements for the implemen<Col N="35" /> tation of the Refugee Act, including the introduction of the fingerprinting provision. It is intended that the Act will be commenced in its entirety early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>Also, the Government has agreed that Ireland should exercise the option, provided by Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of a Council regulation, EC, concerning the establishment of Eurodac, for the comparison of fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other non-nationals.</P>

      <P>The proposal must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before Ireland can exercise its opt-in right under the Treaty of Amsterdam to join other member states in establishing a database for the comparison of fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other non-nationals. This motion will be moved in the Dáil and Seanad this week.</P>
      <P>The statistical information on asylum determinations can be forwarded to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the fingerprints collected in the fingerprinting of asylum seekers be used for the purposes envisaged by Eurodac solely and not for the investigation of any criminal activity in the Irish context? How long will fingerprints be kept? Does the Minister accept that in normal Irish jurisdiction citizens are fingerprinted only when they are suspects in a criminal investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Our current difficulty is that there is evidence of a multiplicity of asylum claims. In some instances, as I said, people tend to make multiple claims. It is entirely logical, therefore, that the Government would seek to ensure, through the use of a fingerprint database, that each individual makes only one claim. I am not saying all applicants do that, but some do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at European Union level is that fingerprinting is deemed necessary by all member states to ensure adherence to the Dublin Convention. Under this convention people must make their applications for asylum at the point of entry to the European Union. There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that people sometimes arrive in England or France and subsequently arrive in Ireland. The clear position under the convention is that such people would be returned to the point where they entered the European Union in order that their applications could be processed. However, in the absence of a fingerprint database which can be compared with a fingerprint database in another member state, it is sometimes difficult, if not actually impossible, to determine whether an individual arrived in <Col N="36" /> another European Union member state in the first instance. It is far more efficient and desirable that this be done through the use of a fingerprint database. That is the view of Council of Ministers and of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention to criminalise any individual through the use of fingerprinting. The objective, as I said, is to utilise it to prevent multiple claims and to ensure adherence to the Dublin Convention. It is proposed that the fingerprints would be retained for a period of ten years.</P>

      <P>I have given evidence to the Moriarty tribunal and remain prepared to provide any further assistance required. My reply in <Col N="38" /> the Dáil on 4 September 1997 related to the use of the leader's account solely during our time in Opposition from 1982 to 1987 and represented my best assessment of the situation, having talked to our administrator at that time, Ms Eileen Foy. These are matters now being reviewed by the tribunal. It will be for it to determine how both public and other funds paid into the account were used and whether payments corresponding to the amount of public funds paid in were used broadly for the purposes intended by the Oireachtas. It is for the tribunal, through its ongoing work of hearings with all relevant witnesses to establish a clear picture of the many transactions. I have no intention in the House of cutting across or duplicating the work of the tribunal and I am very surprised that experienced parliamentarians opposite should even contemplate doing so. As I have said, it was my best assessment of the situation. We must all wait until the tribunal reaches conclusions and then we can debate the matter in light of the information available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the dispatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, as amended by section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the multinational force in East Timor, known as INTERFET, established under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1264 of 15 September 1999 and that it further approves the terms of the Agreement on Participation in the International Force East Timor (INTERFET), a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 6 October 1999.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion, which is required under section 2 of the Defence Act, 1960, as amended by the Defence Act, 1993, is to enable the dispatch of an Irish contingent for service with the UN-authorised multinational force in East Timor. This force was established under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1264 of 15 September 1999. The motion also provides for approval of the terms of an agreement on Ireland's participation in INTERFET. A copy of the proposed agreement has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>This agreement provides that Ireland, like all other countries participating in INTERFET, will be responsible for its own costs. Similar provisions applied in Ireland's participation in SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more recently, in KFOR in Kosovo. In commending the motion to the House I wish to underline a number of key points at the outset.</P>
      <P>First, upon the outbreak of violence in East Timor in September, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs contacted a number of their counterparts to mobilise international support for the establishment of a multinational force. Ireland also pursued the matter directly at the United Nations Security Council in calling for the establishment of such a force. Second, INTERFET's presence is central to the international community's co-ordinated efforts to restore security and normality in East Timor, to protect the civilian population and to facilitate the safe return of refugees to their homes. Third, INTERFET was established under the authority of the UN Security Council through Security Council Resolution 1264. The Government welcomed this resolution as soon as it was adopted and indicated immediately its readiness, subject to the approval of this House, to provide a contingent for the multinational force. Fourth, Irish participation in INTERFET is in keeping with our foreign policy traditions and objectives. It is especially in keeping with our long and respected tradition of peacekeeping that Ireland should participate in this UN-authorised force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to set out the background to INTERFET. The UN Security Council, acting <Col N="47" /> under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, adopted Resolution 1264 on 15 September 1999 which, among other things, authorised the establishment force in East Timor with all the necessary means to fulfil its responsibilities under a unified command structure. This was pursuant to the request of the Government of Indonesia, conveyed to the Secretary General on 12 September 1999. The tasks of the forces as prescribed by the resolution are, first, to restore peace and security in East Timor, second, to protect and support the United Nations mission in East Timor in carrying out its tasks and, third, within force capabilities to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations. The resolution went on to authorise the states participating in the multinational force to take all necessary measures to fulfil this mandate.</P>
    <P>The United Nations civilian mission, UNAMET, was never entirely withdrawn from East Timor, but its operations had to be retrenched in the face of the then violence against its personnel and facilities. It is now being redeployed and rebuilt on the ground as quickly as the replacement of its <i>matériel </i>and facilities can be provided, and the provision of protection and support to it by INTERFET will continue to be one of the latter's key tasks.</P>
    <P>On 14 September the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, was informed by the Foreign Minister of Australia of that country's willingness to command the proposed multinational force and subsequent to the adoption of Resolution 1264 the Government of Indonesia agreed that Australia could have this role. Preparations were made for the early deployment of the force, which was given the name INTERFET, and deployment in East Timor commenced on 20 September. The overall envisaged strength of INTERFET is 8,000 personnel. Its present strength in East Timor is 5,300.</P>
    <P>In view of the geographical location of East Timor, the Security Council and the broad international community were anxious that support for broad implementation of Resolution 1264 be provided, to the greatest extent possible, from the region. This has been done, with participation in INTERFET either already under way or promised, by several Asian countries. In addition, a number of our EU partners have also made commitments and some have already had their forces on the ground. Contributions are also being provided by other countries, including the USA and Canada.</P>
    <P>With regard to the duration of the INTERFET mission in East Timor, it is taking place under what is known as Phase II of 5 May agreement between the United Nations, Indonesia and Portugal, which underpins the entire process towards independence in East Timor. The period known as Phase III will commence when the Indonesian Parliament ratifies the result of the 30 August referendum. Such ratification is expected, at the latest, by the middle of November.</P>
    <P>Under Phase III the United Nations will take <Col N="48" /> over the administration of East Timor in an interim capacity, and for the purpose of assisting the East Timorese to assume the tasks and burdens involved in their independence. As part of the United Nations administration, new arrangements will be made for peacekeeping and security. INTERFET will continue in existence until these are in place. While it is not possible to say at what date such a changeover will take place, it is expected to occur within a period of eight months at the maximum &ndash; indeed the duration could be less.</P>
    <P>East Timor is a major challenge for the international community and is an important foreign policy issue for Ireland. It is likely to be a major issue on the international community's agenda for a considerable time. Irish participation in INTERFET would be in line with the prominence which Ireland has taken on the issue of East Timor within the EU. Ireland has contributed to the United Nations mission in East Timor and is maintaining military liaison officers with that body.</P>
    <P>Participation would also be in line with the Government's underlying approach to the crisis. Key elements of this approach are that the crisis should be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the decisions of the UN Security Council that the democratically expressed wish of the people of East Timor for independence be implemented and that displaced persons within East Timor, in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia must have the right of full and safe return.</P>
    <P>East Timor is devastated as a result of pro-Indonesian militia activity and the destruction caused by departing Indonesian security forces. The capital, Dili, and many other towns have been destroyed. Roads and other infrastructure are in very poor condition. Many thousands of East Timorese have been living, with scarcely any food or shelter, in the mountains, having fled their homes on the outbreak of violence which followed the referendum. Some have returned to their homes since the arrival of INTERFET, but many are still reluctant to do so until security has been restored. Some of the estimated 230,000 East Timorese living in refugee camps in West Timor are also beginning to return. Many people had been forcibly removed either there or to other parts of Indonesia. The Indonesian army has withdrawn the vast bulk of its forces and has left a token presence of approximately 1,400 men. To avoid a security vacuum pending the coming into effect of the next stage of the process, there is an urgent need for INTERFET to increase to full strength to ensure peace and stability.</P>
    <P>Following discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence, discussions took place between Ireland and Australia to ascertain how the proposed Irish contribution might be most effectively utilised. As a result of these discussions it was confirmed that the proposed Irish contribution, comprising 40 personnel, of whom 30 would be from the <Col N="49" /> Army Ranger Wing, would be welcomed. The proposed Irish contingent will comprise a platoon of 30 personnel drawn from the Army Ranger Wing together with a national support element of six personnel. It is also proposed to provide four staff personnel for the headquarters of INTERFET in Dili. The contingent will form part of a New Zealand battalion. The national support element will be located mainly with the Australian Forward Mounting Base in Darwin, Australia, but also in East Timor as required. Participation by the Defence Forces will be for an initial period of four months, beginning on 15 October 1999, with the possibility of a replacement contingent serving for a further period of four months to mid-June 2000.</P>
    <P>The contingent will be under operational control to the commander of INTERFET. The contingent headquarters will be located at INTERFET headquarters in Dili. These headquarters will consist of the senior Irish officer-national contingent commander at lieutenant-colonel level, together with a staff of three. The Army Ranger Wing detachment will come under the senior Irish officer-national contingent commander for national command and discipline purposes. The Army Ranger Wing personnel will be operating within the New Zealand battalion group.</P>
    <P>On 5 October 1999 a Defence Forces officer flew to Sydney, Australia, to act as military liaison officer with INTERFET planning staff. On 7 October 1999 two further officers departed for Sydney to make the necessary preparations for the reception of personnel and equipment in Darwin on 15 October 1999. It is proposed that the main body, including staff for INTERFET headquarters, will depart, subject to Dáil approval, for Darwin on 13 October 1999 and that the contingent will deploy in theatre on or about 22 October 1999 after one week's training and acclimatisation in Townsville, Australia.</P>
    <P>INTERFET operates under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, that is, it is entitled to use force to implement its mandate and to protect itself and the international civil presence, established in accordance with Resolution 1264. The protective element of Chapter VII mandate is becoming the norm in UN authorised operations in recent years, for example, the Somalia operation, the SFOR operation in Bosnia, the KFOR operation in Kosovo and the UN operation in eastern Slovenia. Troop contributing countries are increasingly unwilling to commit troops to operations unless there is a Chapter VII authorisation to enable the peacekeeping force to take all necessary measures to protect itself.</P>
    <P>INTERFET is a challenging and complex undertaking. The situation in the mission is volatile and fluid. INTERFET is attempting to restore peace and security in the area to enable UNAMET to complete its mission and humanitarian organisations to provide the necessary assistance in East Timor. Normalisation of the security situation is, therefore, a priority for the <Col N="50" /> currently deployed elements of INTERFET. The conclusion of the military authorities, following the reconnaissance, is that the risk to INTERFET personnel in East Timor is high and can be expected to remain so in the immediate future. Ongoing risk assessments will take account of developments as the situation in the region evolves.</P>
    <P>The safety of Defence Forces personnel serving on overseas missions is always a matter of serious concern and I can assure the House that this aspect was taken fully into account by the Government in making its decision. In this connection, I would refer to the UN Convention on the Safety and Security of UN and Associated Personnel which was adopted by the Sixth Committee of the United Nations on 9 December 1994. Ireland intends to accede to the convention which came into force on 15 January 1999. The purpose of the convention is to secure the better protection of personnel engaged in UN efforts in the fields of preventative diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping, peace building and humanitarian operations. Some 844 members of the Defence Forces are currently deployed on missions abroad, along with approximately 60 members of the Garda Síochána. On 9 February 1999 the Government approved the preparation of legislation to enable Ireland to accede to the convention. The relevant Bill has been published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and was introduced in the Seanad before the summer recess. It is hoped it will be passed by both Houses this term.</P>
    <P>As the Irish contingent to INTERFET will exceed 12 in number and will be armed, Dáil approval of the dispatch of the contingent is required under the terms of the Defence Acts. As for SFOR and KFOR, all contributors to INTERFET are responsible for all their own costs. This is set out in the terms of the Agreement on Participation, a copy of which has been laid before the House. The terms of the agreement must be approved by Dáil Éireann under Article 29 of the Constitution. The motion before the House incorporates these terms. I estimate that the total costs arising out of Defence Forces participation in INTERFET for eight months from the end of October will be £1,735 million. The 1999 element of these costs &ndash; £834,000 &ndash; will be met out of the existing 1999 Defence Vote. It is of course possible, as I indicated earlier, that the duration of the INTERFET mission will be considerably shorter than eight months.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, the INTERFET command and control arrangements are broadly analogous to those which currently apply to our participation in SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in KFOR in Kosovo. In summary, in so far as the discharge of INTERFET's mandate is concerned, the Irish contingent would come under INTERFET's central and unified command and control structure. All contributing nations will retain national command of their contingents. Moreover, as already applies in the case of SFOR <Col N="51" /> and KFOR, the force commander will utilise national contingents in accordance with their capabilities, taking into account the advice of the national contingent commander.</P>
    <P>INTERFET is an important expression, not just of the international community's commitment to peace in East Timor but also of its will to have the democratically expressed wish of the East Timorese people of 30 August upheld and implemented. Participation in INTERFET would be a further concrete example of our commitment to inclusive co-operative security in the United Nations, and to helping the people of East Timor in their search for peace and normal political life.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long-standing reputation in UN peacekeeping which is a legitimate source of pride for all of us. I attach great importance to our continuing involvement in the mainstream of peacekeeping. Our participation in INTERFET is important in this connection. The Government's approach to the situation in East Timor is one of long standing and has been clear, consistent and unwavering throughout. The pro-active decision by the Government in proposing that the Dáil approve participation in the UN-authorised INTERFET is further evidence of the Government's readiness to play a full part in addressing the humanitarian, political and security challenges posed by the crisis in East Timor in a way which is consistent with our own traditions, capabilities and objectives. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I support the motion, as does my party. The approval given here today will result in Irish soldiers taking on probably the most dangerous task since the Congo. Our service men and women have served with distinction in many parts of the world. For example, we have the largest battalion for the longest period in Lebanon. They have made the country very proud by the honourable service they have given. That all 100 Irish rangers volunteered for this dangerous task shows that our pride is well placed. Our hopes and prayers go with them and to their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UN-led peace enforcement as well as peacekeeping may become increasingly dangerous and will be sub-contracted out, so to speak, more and more to regional organisations in the future. This is the third time Irish forces will serve in a mission involving a peace enforcement element, the first being Somalia and the second SFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Some people inside and outside this House see peace enforcing as some sort of aggressive or even imperialist action. If the international community is to ensure that its will is enforced, peacekeeping, however honourable and beneficial it may be in certain circumstances, is <Col N="52" /> sometimes not enough. Sometimes force has to be used to ensure aid gets through, for example, that refugees can return to their homes and that internationally declared safe havens or safe areas are genuinely safe.</P>
    <P>In the case of East Timor, the international community promised these gentle, peace-loving people that they could exercise their democratic right to choose their own destiny. Now, however belatedly, we must carry out our promise and enable the people of East Timor to return to their homes and enable the independent state of East Timor to be born. Peace enforcing is not about backing one side or another in a super power conflict that ended ten years ago when the Berlin Wall fell. Peace enforcing is about the international community acting under UN mandate through regional structures from time to time to ensure that human rights and international law are respected. In this ever changing, post Cold War environment, Ireland must re-define its role in the new security architecture and we, with our world-wide peacekeeping experience, should be one of the security architects. For too long we have kept our heads down and behaved as if the Cold War continues. Worse still there are those in the House who have recklessly misled the public, as evidenced by the Taoiseach's outrageous claims about Partnership for Peace when in Opposition, cynically and immediately abandoned once in office. We must be more transparent when it comes to security policy. This is why the promised White Paper on defence should immediately be published. Furthermore, the White Paper should address the issue of NATO membership.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has given another undertaking, this time that any move to join NATO would be the subject of a referendum. Is this not exactly what he said on PfP? Why should people now take him at his word? It is time for Fianna Fáil to stop the cynical opportunism on foreign policy and be honest with the Irish people about the options which we could follow. Failure to clearly spell out the options in the White Paper and to encourage a public debate will lead to accusations of trying to railroad through a decision when eventually, in the not too distant future, we face important decisions on Ireland's involvement in international security structures.</P>
    <P>If ever we join NATO let it be done by the front door and with the knowledge of the people. That is why I believe there should be a debate on NATO membership. Article V of the NATO charter presents a most serious commitment and should only be taken on with public approval. Let us remember, however, that Seán McBride, the then Minister for External Affairs, said in 1949 that Ireland would become a full charter member of NATO the day after partition ends. The Good Friday Agreement has dealt with that principle. The people of Strabane are bound by all the articles of the NATO charter; their neighbours in Lifford are not. What will happen if all-Ireland <Col N="53" /> security and defence becomes an agenda item in some future North-South discussions? Surely any stance to be taken by the Irish Government should be capable of carrying the public with it in this specific area. This can only happen if the public has heard the debate. The debate should be informed by the upcoming White Paper, which should set out the case for and against NATO membership so the public and their representatives in Parliament know and understand the issues at stake.</P>
    <P>Anybody calling for a debate on NATO membership automatically runs the risk of being accused of favouring NATO membership, something I have been accused of in the past when I called for such a debate. I am not calling for membership of NATO, because I have not heard the arguments for and against. However, could we please stop throwing the word NATO around as if it was a four letter, dirty word? Part of this island is already in NATO. Let us put behind us the era when we were not capable of discussing issues openly, fairly and transparently. It is not necessary to abuse or accuse each other. If I heard the debate and became convinced of the arguments against joining NATO, then I might become one of the greatest advocates arguing against NATO membership. However, when I simply ask to hear the case for and against, all I hear are accusations of militarism and some political blackguarding. The Minister could do a great public service by setting out the case for and against membership in the proposed White Paper on defence. In these changing times it would be wiser for us to have the debate than to put our trust in assurances given by the Taoiseach which turn out not to be worth the paper on which they are written.</P>
    <P>The White Paper must also take account of the serious developments in the European Union and the emerging European defence identity. The EU summit in Cologne last June agreed that the military planning and co-operation functions of the Western European Union be incorporated into the EU. Ireland is fully involved in the discussions on how to bring this about and the transfer of these functions to the EU is expected to be completed by the end of 2000. The courage shown by the brave Irish soldiers now preparing to depart for East Timor should inspire politicians to have the courage to give leadership in important areas of public policy. Policy on defence should not be developed on a nod and wink basis; it is time to be up-front and open and to set out our policies in writing in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I pay tribute to Mr. Tom Hyland in particular. He has taught us all a lesson, namely, that each person counts. He has single-handedly put this issue on the agenda in Ireland and it is a great indication to us all that each of us individually can make a difference, and I salute him. I am also delighted that my introduction of a Private Members' Bill to give effect to the convention on the protection of UN personnel serving abroad and my raising of the issue many times <Col N="54" /> in the House has resulted in the Bill being passed by the Seanad and being about to be passed by the Dáil, if it has not already been passed today. I ask that it be implemented without further delay, because so far we have lost 76 Irish service men and women serving abroad and it is absurd to think that they, if attacked while serving with the UN for example, can have the protection of the law in New Zealand but not in Ireland. Therefore, I am delighted to see the legislation going through the Oireachtas as our soldiers going to East Timor should have that protection.</P>
    <P>My party will support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing time with me. I also take this opportunity to welcome back Deputy Seán Power who, following the shock of the closure of Magee Barracks, has finally made his way back to protect the back of the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>I join my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, in welcoming this motion. It is timely in that it comes on the eve of the motion on Partnership for Peace. I also received today a copy of a small booklet, <i>My time in the Congo</i>, by Joe Fitzpatrick, one of only two survivors, along with Thomas Kenny, of the Niemba ambush in November 1960. I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Minister the lack of official recognition of these two survivors.</P>
      <P>Today's motion is a requirement under section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993 in order to enable the dispatch of an Irish contingent for service with the UN authorised international security presence in East Timor. As tensions increase in the world's trouble spots, the peacekeeping skills of the Irish, which are almost unique, are in much demand. This slogan is repeated so often that it may lose its effectiveness, but I can assure the House that having witnessed it at first hand in the Lebanon and Cyprus, the Irish temperament, aligned to an uncanny ability to assess and defuse an incident, places us in a different league in the nations of peacekeepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the Irish contingent gets to East Timor as soon as possible as they can bring a calming influence to a force that may operate a little too rigidly on occasion if one is to take at face value recent television footage. The presence of a peacekeeping force in East Timor is central to the international community's co-ordinated efforts to restore security and normalisation, to protect the civilian population and to facilitate the safe return of refugees to their homes. As the Minister mentioned in his speech, INTERFET, the international force in East Timor, was authorised by the UN Security Council acting under chapter 7 of the UN charter under resolution 1264 on 15 September 1999. INTERFET will be deployed under unified command and control with the aim of providing a safe environment for all the people of East Timor. It will initially assist UNAMET, the current multi<Col N="55" /> national force in East Timor, and will ultimately replace it. The responsibilities of INTERFET under Security Council Resolution 1264 include, among other things, deterring renewed hostilities, establishing a secure environment, ensuring public safety and order and protection and freedom of movement.</P>
    <P>Our contingent will be composed of members from the Army ranger wing who are more than capable of carrying out these tasks. It is a welcome development that they have been afforded an opportunity to make a public contribution. Much resources and time have been put into their training. Fortunately they have been called upon only on rare occasions to deal with matters at home. I hope this climate will continue. It should not however deter us from continuing to put resources into this elite and necessary force.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the work of a few dedicated individuals many people in this country have some knowledge of East Timor. Most of us in this House are familiar with the information supplied by Mr. Tom Hyland over many years. He is to be complimented for his perseverance and commitment.</P>
    <P>There was a general sense of relief when it was established that an open election would be held. We are proud that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, had a central part to play in this. The initial jubilation, however, was short-lived as the horror pictures of atrocity after atrocity flashed into our living rooms. As is always the case with these terrible tragedies, the extent of the carnage and terror is never fully understood until a long time thereafter. We always talk about learning lessons but the international community never appears to put such lessons to practical use. It is unacceptable that the treatment of a group or section of society has to become so brutal before any remedial steps are taken. I realise this and other similar situations are never as simple and straightforward as often depicted but the happenings in the aftermath of the elections were well signalled from many quarters.</P>
    <P>Without fear of contradiction, one can state that there were systematic widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in East Timor. Where possible, those who bear individual responsibility should be brought to justice. There were attacks on the staff and premises of the United Nations mission in East Timor, on other officials and on national and international humanitarian personnel. The members of the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána who served in East Timor during this time deserve our thanks and admiration for the courage and commitment they displayed in what must have been a most difficult period for them and their families. The personal element is often forgotten when we make calls for military intervention. It is as if it is something way out there but such multinational or special forces the world over merely consist of someone's mother or <Col N="56" /> father, sister or brother, son or daughter who have no other ambition than to make this world a better place to live.</P>
    <P>From the Wild Geese to INTERFET Irish people have made a contribution and I warmly welcome the Government's decision to move towards our entry to Partnership for Peace when many more Irish troops will be afforded an opportunity to make a positive contribution to world peace. It is never necessary to force people on such missions as the will to participate has always been there and I hope that will remain the case.</P>
    <P>On 5 May 1999 agreements were made between East Timor and Portugal and the United Nations and the Governments of East Timor and Portugal which briefly outline the peaceful and orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the United Nations which would initiate the procedure enabling East Timor to begin the process of transition towards independence. The Indonesian authorities were either unwilling or unable to provide for the peaceful implementation of this agreement as they oversaw the systematic implementation of a scorched earth policy in East Timor under the direction of the Indonesian military. There was a massive forced displacement of the population to refugee camps in West Timor and efforts to permanently displace refugees around Indonesia. The militia and the Indonesian army engaged in selective execution of students, intellectuals and activists and are responsible for the disappearance of large groups of people and mass killings in various locations, including Dili and the internally displaced persons camp in the Church and Suai. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has stated that the President of Indonesia accepted a proposal to establish a joint commission of inquiry on human rights violations. I hope the Government will keep this commitment on its agenda and pursue it at every available opportunity. In all this chaos UNAMET was forced to withdraw from its headquarters.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on the international community to ensure the will of the East Timorese people is respected without additional suffering. Notwithstanding all of this, it is imperative that INTERFET conducts itself in an impartial manner so that its presence can be credible. It should endeavour to earn the confidence and trust of the parties in conflict while ensuring its actions do not make a difficult situation more difficult. UN Resolution 1264 is just an initial step in the difficult and complex process of restoring peace and order in East Timor and implementing the election result of 30 August. For INTERFET to be successful it must have the full co-operation of the Indonesian authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Government to send an Irish contingent on this mission where the expenses of the force will be borne by the participating member states. The experience gained by members of our Defence Forces in Somalia in the early 1990s and in Kosovo will be <Col N="57" /> put to good use in the planning and preparation of the contingent. Ireland has a longstanding reputation in peacekeeping which is a legitimate source of pride to us all. INTERFET is an expression of the international community's commitment to peace in East Timor and for us in Ireland it is a demonstration of a co-operative approach to ensuring international peace and security.</P>
    <P>This year we celebrate 41 years of peacekeeping. The Defence Forces have served on 52 missions on four continents contributing 45,000 tours of duty and suffering 76 fatalities. There are 844 Irish troops serving on over 20 missions overseas. For a small force it is a big commitment. It is essential that the best equipment is made available and I urge the Minister to condense the purchasing programme for the armoured personnel carriers to enable our troops to continue their participation at the highest level.</P>
    <P>We are often quick to have a go at the Minister but I compliment him on keeping his commitment to increase overseas allowances. It is important in the current economic climate to pay more than lip-service to the service provided by our troops who make great sacrifices to serve overseas, often at monetary loss. I wish the families of those who will serve with INTERFET well and the troops a safe tour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and express the support of the Labour Party for the decision to send a contingent of Irish troops to serve with INTERFET in East Timor. This is the second occasion this year on which the Dáil has had to sanction the involvement of Irish troops in an international peacekeeping operation. As with the motion passed on 1 July sanctioning the participation of Irish troops in the KFOR operation in Kosovo, the INTERFET force is operating under a United Nations mandate and is entirely in keeping with the active role Irish troops have played in peacekeeping operations throughout the world for more than 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that Irish troops will face a difficult task in East Timor which is still recovering from the impact of almost 25 years of illegal occupation by Indonesian forces. The situation remains fraught with danger with armed militia groups still active in the background, ethnic hatred still very evident, tens of thousands of refugees returning to villages and homes destroyed by months of conflict. The aftermath of the activities of the Jakarta backed militias has left a huge humanitarian problem with hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps as many as 500,000, unaccounted for. These are the people who fled into the mountains or across the border into West Timor to try to avoid the murderous intention of the militias. When they do return many will find their homes have been devastated and their crops destroyed. They will face a fraught and uncertain future. Clearly an urgent priority for INTERFET must be to create the conditions where those who have left can return <Col N="58" /> to their homes and where the necessary level of food relief can be provided until the people of East Timor can cope for themselves. Some concern has already been expressed by relief organisations at what they see as the relatively slow pace of the INTERFET operation to date, but it is understandable that the force has to proceed with some degree of caution. Already there have been a number of clashes between INTERFET troops and East Timor militiamen, in which the militiamen died and Australian troops were wounded. Confusion over maps led to another clash between Australian troops and Indonesian forces in which an Indonesian policeman died. There is always the danger of accidental conflict between INTERFET and the pro-independence guerrilla movement, FALINTIL.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the difficulty and dangers facing the Irish troops going to East Timor. While the priority must be to restore order and provide secure and stable conditions, neither the Irish troops nor, indeed, any other troops with INTERFET, should be unnecessarily exposed to danger.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on our Government to ensure that when Irish troops serve abroad on peace-keeping operations they have the equipment and training necessary to guarantee the maximum possible level of safety and security. I know that training will not be a problem, as has already been stated by a number of speakers, as Irish troops have always been well prepared for operations abroad. This is acknowledged in the respect with which they are held by other contingents with which they have served.</P>
    <P>However, the situation in regard to equipment is much less satisfactory. In this regard the long delays in providing the Army with modern armoured personnel carriers is particularly unfortunate. Troops in such an area cannot rely on trucks and jeeps alone. The shortage of adequate equipment has meant that Irish troops serving abroad have had, to some extent, to depend on other contingents for protection. This is not operationally desirable and neither is it good for morale.</P>
    <P>If we want our troops to be able to play an active role in peace-keeping operations throughout the world, then we will have to provide them with the resources and equipment to enable them to do so. Money is available and, in particular, I would urge the Government to expedite the delivery of the long promised armoured personnel carriers.</P>
    <P>The death, earlier this year, of Private William Kedian in the Lebanon while serving with UNIFIL, illustrates the sort of dangers that our troops serving abroad face on a daily basis. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their willingness to put themselves in danger in the interests of bringing peace to the trouble spots of the world. The very least we can do to repay that debt is to ensure that they have the best possible equipment.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the East Timor oper<Col N="59" /> ation are somewhat unusual. As I understand it, the INTERFET operation is initially under the control of Australia but sanctioned by a UN resolution. My understanding is that at some point before the end of this year, the United Nations will assure direct control of this operation. I note from the agreement laid before the Dáil that the financial arrangements for INTERFET will be quite different from those operations under direct United Nations control, as for example the UNIFIL operation in the Lebanon, where part of the cost is reimbursed by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It seems from the documents laid before the House that the Irish Government will have to bear the entire cost, including wages, transport, equipment, food, lodging, utilities and medical care. I don't have any problem with the principle that we should pay for our own contingent, but I would ask the Minister if any estimate is available of the likely cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Of just this operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the whole operation. The Minister has, in fact, addressed some of those costs in his speech, for which I thank him. Will the funding arrangements, however, change when the United Nations assumes direct control? We have been clearly appraised as to what the present position is and I gather from the Taoiseach's response that the funding arrangements will not change. I would also ask if allowances have been agreed with PDFORRA and RACO on the allowances to be paid to our troops serving with INTERFET. The Minister is indicating that they have.</P>
      <P>Twenty five years ago the international community stood aside and took no action when Indonesia illegally invaded and annexed East Timor. For much of the past 25 years, the international community turned a blind eye to the suffering of the people of East Timor at the hands of Indonesian forces. A handful of journalists worked tirelessly to ensure that we were not allowed to ignore what was happening. In the case of Ireland, as has already been said, Tom Hyland and the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign have literally done Trojan work; initially in making members of the Dáil and the public aware of the problem of East Timor and, subsequently, in keeping us up to date with developments there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community is culpable for its failure to act over 25 years. Indeed, the United Nations is also open to criticism for its failure to take adequate steps to ensure that the people of East Timor were provided with adequate protection when they participated in the recent UN-sponsored referendum on the future of that territory. Sadly, as we all know, the people of East Timor, at the urging of the United Nations, put their faith in the democratic system. When they voted overwhelmingly for independence on 30 August, however, they found themselves at the <Col N="60" /> mercy of the murderous activities of the Jakarta-backed militias and, in some cases, regular Indonesian forces. There was nobody there to protect them.</P>
    <P>The international community now has an obligation to try to make up for the 25 years of neglect. We can do this in two ways. First, by mounting a humanitarian operation on the scale required to ensure safety, shelter and food for all of the people of East Timor, and, second, by ensuring that those who were responsible for the atrocities against the people of East Timor are brought to account.</P>
    <P>After 25 years of occupation and exploitation, and especially in the aftermath of the recent violence, East Timor &ndash; as we have heard from the Minister &ndash; is in a sorry state. With the withdrawal of Indonesian troops and many Indonesian settlers, much of whatever infrastructure there was, both physical and social, has collapsed. There was much looting prior to the Indonesian withdrawal. It seems that there will be no alternative to the UN taking over and effectively administering the territory until such time as a fully functioning, independent state can be established in accordance with the democratic wish of the people, as expressed in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Let the House be under no illusion, this will be a costly business. The cost, for example, of the United Nations civil administration which ran post-war Cambodia for 18 months in the early years of this decade, came to around $1.66 billion. Many of those countries which are most critical of the United Nations are also those who are slowest in paying their debts to that organisation. I would remind the House that during a recent visit to Washington, the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, pointed to the failure of the United States to discharge its debt of $1.7 billion to the United Nations. She said the failure was depriving United Nations agencies such as the Commission for Human Rights of the funding needed to discharge their tasks. I understand that the United States, which committed possibly hundreds of millions of dollars to the war effort over Kosovo, has yet to pay any of the approximately $40 million start-up cost of the subsequent civilian policing operation.</P>
    <P>The United States is not the only offender, but I hope that our Government will put pressure on all defaulters to fulfil their financial obligations to the United Nations. In relation to the United States, this is not a failure of the Administration led by President Clinton; this is the failure of the conservative, Republican-dominated Congress to vote the moneys necessary in successive annual budgets to meet their legal obligations to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>While this country has already made a modest contribution to the relief operations in East Timor, we are in a position to do much more and we should do it. Particular attention must be paid to the plight of up to 250,000 people who are still over the border in West Timor. Many of these <Col N="61" /> are living in appalling conditions in camps where they are still at the mercy of Indonesian forces and pro-Jakarta militias. Reports from reputable international relief bodies, like Trócaire, talk of Indonesian military and militias &ldquo;systematically raping, executing and disappearing prisoners in the camps of West Timor&rdquo;. The United Nations must insist on access to these camps and all those who wish to do so must be allowed to return to East Timor as soon as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland should be seeking first, the establishment of an independent international panel of experts and a war crimes tribunal, through the invocation of the Genocide Convention and second, there should be full access for UNHCR and the international humanitarian organisations to all the camps in West Timor; third, control over the safe and voluntary return of refugees should be given to an international body, specifically the UNHCR; and, fourth, all the militias should be disarmed and disbanded. In addition to taking this welcome initiative, which the Labour Party warmly supports, the Government must also mount a diplomatic initiative.</P>
    <P>I can think of few international incidents in recent times that have galvanised so much public and popular support here as the plight of the East Timorese. That was particularly the case due to the work done of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign in bringing to our attention the plight of the people in East Timor and of the United Nations, following the collapse of the Suharto regime, in inviting those people to participate in an exercise of democracy.</P>
    <P>As we move into a global economy and move to regulate and legalise international trade in the form of the World Trade Organisation and as we try to create a new global civic order for much of the commerce we, in Europe, take for granted and for much of the economic activities that now take place on a daily basis across the globe, we cannot pretend to try to have that kind of integration of the global market economy and not have it matched by the promotion of democracy and the rule of law nationally and internationally. East Timor is likely to be a test case for many people in East Asia in particular who note the commitment given by the West to free market economics but seem to think we can have such economics without functioning democracies running side by side. It is, therefore, not sufficient for us to do what we are willingly and happily doing here today in approving a motion to send 40 of our best trained troops to East Timor. We also must complement their work on the ground with diplomatic efforts within the United Nations, the European Union and the World Trade Organisation to copperfasten the foundations of democracy tentatively laid in East Timor on 30 August by a brave people only to be abandoned by the international community, the horrific results of which we all saw on television.</P>
    <P>I hope the force will be able soon to operate within the operational mandate of the United Nations and that it will be seen as a United <Col N="62" /> Nations force and not an Australian-led force because of geopolitical reasons. I hope the Minister will be able to report back to the House in the near future on how the operation is functioning and what the next step will be. As our troops seem to have been in Lebanon for a long time, an Irish contingent is likely to be posted in East Timor for a long time because that territory does not yet have the capability of becoming an independent State, given that it is so close to such a powerful neighbour.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion to approve the dispatch of an Irish Defence Forces unit to East Timor. The horrific pictures and terrible stories we saw and heard during recent weeks have sickened people throughout the country. While it is all very well to comment with the benefit of hindsight when we are well versed on East Timor, given that independent analysts predicted before the referendum was held what would happen after it was held, the terrible atrocities that have taken place since the referendum should not come as any great surprise. There can be no doubt but that the international community failed the civilian population of East Timor.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the decision to send this mission to East Timor to try to restore peace and security there, for many, such assistance will come too late. The purpose of this mission is to protect the civilian population, to ensure the safety of refugees as they return to their homes and to give them some hope for the future. I am delighted Irish troops will participate in this mission. As soon as the UN Security Council established INTERFET, the Government signalled its intention to support this initiative and this motion seeks the approval of the House to send an Irish contingent to East Timor.</P>
      <P>Other speakers mentioned our great tradition in peacekeeping, the type of person we send abroad and how well our peacekeepers have been accepted in many parts of the globe. This mission is a positive development and one I support. I am aware from those in Army circles and particularly from those in the ranger wing who will go on this mission that they are keen to participate. As Deputy Timmins, who has plenty of experience in this area, explained earlier, the ranger wing is probably the most highly trained unit within the Defence Forces and, fortunately, it is not called into action too often. Those in the unit are delighted to get this opportunity to put into practice what they have been training, over many years, to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important not to underestimate the risk this type of mission involves. Often, it is only when bodies are returned home that we realise the dangers troops are placed in when they serve overseas. These troops could not be heading to a <Col N="63" /> more difficult situation than that which exists in East Timor at present. While they realise that, they are prepared to make that sacrifice in the interests of bringing about peace in East Timor. That is something we should not take for granted.</P>
    <P>In terms of our participation in future United Nations missions, we must acknowledge that our capabilities are very restricted due to our lack of equipment. While I realise a programme is in place to re-equip the Defence Forces, it extends over too long a period. It is important the Minister shortens the period for the implementation of that programme to ensure our troops can serve overseas in a meaningful way in the future. We should not allow ourselves to be restricted to the extent to which we are at present due to a lack of equipment. Our troops have proved to be very acceptable peacekeepers in the past and it is important to uphold that tradition through continued participation.</P>
    <P>This mission is a positive development and I wish those taking part in it a safe tour. While the tour of duty will be four months &ndash; the Minister indicated our troops might serve for another four months &ndash; I hope it is not as long as Deputy Quinn predicted and that peace will be restored to this area that recently suffered such atrocities.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have praised Tom Hyland for the tremendous work he did. I would like to be associated with those comments and to pay tribute to the Members of the Dáil and Seanad who supported Mr. Hyland's calls for assistance. I am sure that for a long time they believed they were very much on their own and did not get the support they sought from the Government. Their efforts in that regard must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>On the day of the all-Ireland, Mr. Hickey made a case for Cuba. While the situation in Cuba has not received the attention it deserves, perhaps that protest could be the start of efforts to bring about major changes that must take place in that country. The US policy on Cuba is indefensible. Given the critical role the US plays in Northern Ireland and the wonderful efforts it has made there, we are reluctant to criticise its policy on Cuba. It is, however, important that we should reflect on these matters in isolation and not allow our views to be blinkered.</P>
    <P>The Cuban situation should not be tolerated. Many children and older people there are dying for want of basic medicines. The blockade in Cuba should not be allowed to continue. I would like the Government to raise this issue at European level.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for resolving the problem of overseas allowances, which a number of Members raised during debates in the House. The increases are acceptable to both RACO and PDFORRA. I wish those participating in the tour a safe journey and I thank them for the courage they are showing the rest of the world.</P>

      <P>On 30 August when the people of East Timor voted for independence I am sure <Col N="64" /> they thought that six weeks later they would be savouring the freedom of democracy. However, they are the people who are suffering and we could have anticipated it. From thousands of miles away, courtesy of people such as Tom Hyland, we knew the Indonesian authorities would not accept it. The world knew trouble would follow and the United Nations knew democracy would not be enforced as quickly, speedily or easily as one would have hoped.</P>
      <P>Who was given responsibility for security in East Timor following the elections? Indonesia, a country which closed off East Timor from 1975 to 1989 and arrested its own people if they were seen walking down the street with East Timorese, was given responsibility. That agreement was made by the United Nations, Portugal, the colonial power, and Indonesia, the departing power. The United Nations failed to exert its authority to recognise that trouble was imminent and did not include a safety clause or a fall back position in case security in East Timor did not work out and, as we have seen, it has not.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks those people have suffered murder, rape, maiming, genocide and the destruction and devastation of their country by the Indonesian authorities and militias backed by those authorities. They have witnessed the most gross violations of human rights. This could have been anticipated but the United Nations is guilty of the failure to anticipate these events. As a member of the United Nations, we had to wait until the United Nations was invited in, although we were willing to participate in any force. Why wait and witness these gross violations? Why wait for the genocide? Surely a case can be made for having an international peacekeeping force on standby which would not take six weeks to put together but would be ready to move in and protect these people? Some of the people who are now willing to participate in a peacekeeping force are exerting gross hypocrisy by funding and providing arms to the Indonesian authorities, while knowing they will be used against the vulnerable people of East Timor.</P>
      <P>Australia deserves credit for its role in establishing the initial force in East Timor. Today we are putting our money where our mouth is by agreeing to participate in the force. It was my privilege, as part of an all-party delegation, to meet Alexander Downer, the Australian Foreign Minister, prior to the vote on East Timor. He questioned why a small country thousands of miles away would be interested in East Timor and he wanted to know if we would be willing to take a proactive role. Today shows that not only do we talk about human rights and raise it at United Nations level, but we are also willing to send our forces. We have already sent gardaí to the area in a civilian capacity and we are now sending the Irish Rangers. I wish them well in their work. The gardaí have played a valuable role since they arrived but more needs to be done. This week we witnessed attacks on the Catholic church and the burning of radio stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Today I spoke with Tom Hyland who is in Darwin on his way to Dili. The message he wants to get across is that the 180,000 people who are trapped in West Timor and who want food, medicine and shelter also want to go home. That is the message we also want to send. They need aid and I commend John O'Shea and Goal who are active in this area. However, there are other ways we can help apart from what we are doing today. We must help to eradicate TB, which is one of the great scares, and to contribute to the long-term development of East Timor through education and training.</P>
    <P>As a country which made a peaceful transition to independence and democracy after our War of Independence and the Civil War, we can help this new independent state by giving it support and advice on how to run its Government and implement democracy. Reconciliation and rebuilding are the key words in relation to East Timor. Ireland is playing a role today. Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs we have continually highlighted the issues. I hope it is just the beginning of our commitment to East Timor to uphold democracy, to ensure that what has happened for the past 25 years and the trouble we could have anticipated in East Timor will not happen again because we and the United Nations sat back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which commits Irish troops to further peacekeeping work, which is not without its dangers. The last time we discussed sending troops abroad was in relation to Kosovo, another place which was not without its dangers. I commend the courage and willingness of the members of the Defence Forces to serve abroad.</P>
      <P>The international community watched with horror a number of weeks ago as the saga in East Timor unfolded. I agree with Deputy Hanafin that it was a tragic symbol of the ineffectiveness of the United Nations and it has done much to undermine the efforts of the UN to reform and rebuild. I hope that in the weeks and months ahead the UN peacekeeping force will do something to change that and to make up for what the people of East Timor suffered. We should have had a force ready to go in and the people should not have been left in such an appalling unprotected state.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the proactive role he took, both nationally and internationally, in relation to East Timor and Tom Hyland who has done so much over a long period to sensitise us on this issue. It shows how important one person's commitment and dedication to a cause can be in our world today. It is encouraging to know that one person can make a difference by his or her sense of commitment, expertise and willingness to highlight a particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion commits members of the Defence Forces to serve in East Timor. They and the Irish Rangers were not reluctant or did not hesitate to <Col N="66" /> put themselves forward for this mission. Similar questions to those on Kosovo arise about this mission. We are proud of the record the men and women of the Defence Forces have earned over the past 40 years. They have been heroes and they have suffered. Some months ago we sent our sympathy to the family of Private William Kedian who died in the Lebanon. When we send our troops abroad, the question immediately arises as to whether we are prepared for the mission and if we have sufficient numbers, resources and equipment to ensure they can participate safely. These are relevant questions when we send troops abroad for peace enforcement, which is more dangerous. We have seen on television in recent days how dangerous the mission in East Timor can be and we know how dangerous it was in Kosovo. These requests bring into sharp relief the type of tasks now demanded of our Defence Forces and how we need to invest in them. I recently visited Lebanon with Deputies McGennis and O'Sullivan and we saw the work being done there. We saw that resources for mine clearance and APCs were necessary for safety, given the explosion of mines and shelling.</P>
    <P>Our Defence Forces do not have adequate resources and this limits the role they can play. We must welcome the dispatch of the Army rangers to East Timor where they can play a major role in restoring peace in difficult circumstances. However, it is clear we will only be able to play a minor role in international peacekeeping unless the Government provides better resources to the Defence Forces. Much of the money promised from the sale of Army barracks for reinvestment in the Defence Forces must be front-loaded to allow the early purchase of necessary equipment. When the Defence Forces went to Lebanon, the equipment was supplied. In the new type of peacekeeping, we must carry our own costs and purchase suitable equipment for the terrain and tasks involved. At the moment we have only two APCs which are used for training purposes. This shortage of equipment has already prevented Irish troops from playing a major role in Kosovo where we only sent a transport company. We had to borrow the lorries in which troops trained for that mission.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces need a great deal of investment if they are to carry out international peacekeeping tasks. The Minister's gradual approach to signing a contract for new equipment means it will be up to six years before the Army gets it. In that context, discussion about our role in Partnership for Peace is rhetoric. There is no possibility of developing and fulfilling the promises we have made if we do not take on board the need to invest in the Defence Forces. It is unfair to send them abroad without the proper equipment and training.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we send the contingent of 30 soldiers plus ten support personnel. However, other forces apart from the rangers are needed in East Timor. We must put this in perspective. Australia has committed 4,500 troops to <Col N="67" /> INTERFET, of whom 3,000 are already on the ground. Its near neighbour, New Zealand, has committed 1,000 troops, including SAS units, to which the Irish ranger unit is to be attached. To maintain an acceptable force to space ratio, these combat troops are being deployed ahead of support personnel. The support units are at a premium, so much so that Australia is recalling reservists and ex-servicemen and women with medical and engineering skills to the colours to meet that need.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt as to where priorities lie. It is clear that the most pressing need is for medical and engineering units, not additional combat units which lack self-sufficiency. The UN has consistently said that the relatively ready availability of combat troops is rarely matched by an equivalent commitment of technologically sophisticated support and logistical troops whose presence is critical to the success of major relief operations such as the present one, where large numbers of people have been rendered dependent on the ability of the international community for the basics of life. As an industrialised nation, Ireland may reasonably be expected to provide soldiers with specialist skills in support and logistical technologies to operations such as INTERFET.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that this proposal goes no way towards meeting that expectation and need. This must be seriously considered and addressed in the longer term if Ireland is to maintain its reputation as a responsible member of the international community. Our growing prosperity has made it possible and practical to make good past deficits in the investment in our defence infrastructure. The resources are there and we do not have the excuse of relative poverty. We can and should do more to adequately equip our Defence Forces for peacekeeping operations. Fine Gael has long argued in favour of providing enhanced logistical, signal, police, transport and medical support to peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>This proposal is what Irish people want and it is clearly the will of the majority in this House that we should send troops abroad, as was evident from the debate on Kosovo and our willingness to join international peacekeeping missions. If we are to continue to do this effectively, given the change in peacekeeping operations, we will need to examine the resources of the Defence Forces. We also need to look at the number of troops we are sending, given the enormous range of needs in East Timor and the human rights issues at the core of the conflict there. As a nation moving into the 21st century, this is the very least we can do to fulfil our international obligations.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. As the Minister said, Ireland's participation in INTERFET is in keeping with its long and respected tradition of peacekeeping. I join in paying tribute to Mr. Tom Hyland, who is a constituent of mine. He has proved how the single-minded determination of one person can bring to prominence the plight of a country such as East Timor, not just here but worldwide. He has significantly contributed its achievement of independence.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the task of the force is threefold: to restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect and support the United Nations mission in East Timor and, within force capabilities, to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations. Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned our visit, along with Deputy O'Sullivan, to Lebanon. The Minister said the conclusion of the military authorities following reconnaissance is that risk to INTERFET personnel in East Timor is high and can be expected to remain so. It was presumed that because of the long period spent by Irish troops in Lebanon there was little or no risk. However, two weeks after our visit, Private Billy Kedian was killed during active service.</P>
      <P>When we decide to embark on missions which differ from our normal UN mandate, it is important people know the risk is significant and the force we are sending is different from those we sent to the Congo, Cyprus and Lebanon, which were unarmed missions. This is different and it is important people know that.</P>
      <P>The cost of the operation was referred to, which also reflects a change in our UN responsibilities. Although it is right that Deputy Quinn should bring this to our notice, the Irish people understand why this money needs to be spent, given the suffering of the East Timorese, as we have seen on television. Following the referendum it was hoped there would a peaceful transition to independence. However, what happened subsequently was unbelievable and the East Timorese now face a difficult future. We owe a debt of gratitude to one RTE correspondent who remained in East Timor for some time and reported on what happened. Bishop Carlos Belo described what happened following the referendum as &ldquo;a vision of hell&rdquo;. Deputy Dukes and I oversaw elections in Cambodia this year. We visited a number of places in that country to see where atrocities had occurred and we vowed silently that these would not be permitted to happen again. However, judging from the pictures on our television screens and what the Bishop described, the atrocities which were carried out in Cambodia so many years ago were recently repeated in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy Hanafin, Tom Hyland says the people of East Timor want freedom and independence. They are entitled to freedom and independence and, I hope they now see themselves on the road to achieving that. However, the huge humanitarian need there should be put on record. It should be our main reason for send<Col N="69" /> ing troops. The major health problems of the East Timorese are tuberculosis, malaria and HIV, while 44 per cent of the population sufferss from malnutrition. If that is the state of the health of the East Timorese, they must be urgently taken out of the refugee camps and returned to their homelands where the humanitarian organisations and the UN mission can provide them with basic sanitary and medical supports.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and I hope we can assist the East Timorese assume the tasks and burdens of independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which provides for the participation of Irish troups in the INTERFET mission. Some of my colleagues and I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia a couple of days before the referendum in East Timor. What was most striking about this affair was the relative unpreparedness of the international community for what became a humanitarian disaster on a scale to which, unfortunately, we have become accustomed.</P>
      <P>The United Nations and significant members of that organisation were caught napping yet again. It happened previously in the cases of Rwanda, Somalia and Kosovo. Whether it is due to the bureaucracy of the UN or the composition of the Security Council and the ability of large members to veto decisions, each time there is a significant international catastrophe as occurred in East Timor, the United Nations is ready &ndash; yet again &ndash; to do nothing. That should concern us. When we are discussing the future of Irish foreign policy, which is bound to arise later this week when the House discusses participation in PfP, this issue should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I pay tribute to the role played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, not only in his capacity as Minister but also prior to his appointment. He succeeded, with Tom Hyland, in highlighting the problems in East Timor which the international community should have been ready to confront. The Minister was highly regarded in his role as special representative of the EU when he visited Dili.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The INTERFET mission is high risk both for its participants and for the people of East Timor. The expectations of the East Timorese are high, and rightly so. They have been savagely and brutally treated. There is an issue of genocide here which should be addressed and I will refer to it again if time permits. I am delighted Ireland can send troops, albeit a small number, to participate in this mission. I agree with other speakers that we should be able to provide troops on a wider scale for peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions such as this. Ireland has built up a unique expertise in this area over the years and, as a mature democracy, we should not be afraid to participate as much as possible even if resources can be limited from time to time. We were very glad of the support of other countries <Col N="70" /> when we were going through the difficulties of the peace process and this is our opportunity to reciprocate.</P>
    <P>On the role Irish humanitarian organisations have played, Bishop Kirby and Justin Kilcullen of Trócaire and other NGOs managed to penetrate into East Timor long before the UN could. This is an example of a unique input which we, as a western democracy, can play in these situations. The international community should pursue the possibility of establishing a war crimes tribunal to investigate the crimes that have been committed against the people of East Timor by their oppressors. The pictures we saw on television and the reports in the newspapers over recent weeks are chilling. In terms of severity, unfortunately, they match the brutality and savagery of anything we saw in Kosovo and elsewhere. The establishment of a war crimes tribunal would be a positive contribution.</P>
    <P>I wish the Irish troops well. They will discharge their duties as well as other Irish troops and gardaí have done and are doing in other similar missions. As was said in one of today's newspapers, the international community must ensure that East Timor or Timor does not become a new Vietnam or Australia's Vietnam. It has the potential to spin even further out of control if the UN does not manage to focus its attention and use the INTERFET mission in the way the international community expects it to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government's proposal to send a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the multinational force in East Timor. I also share the motivation for this proposal as expressed by the Minister, my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald and other contributors to this debate. We are right to show our concern and to support that concern for the human rights of the people of East Timor, their civil rights, their right to live in peace and their right to personal safety and integrity. These are the reasons it is appropriate that we should participate in this operation.</P>
      <P>In doing this, we reaffirm our support for UN peacekeeping operations and our readiness to participate in them. That is entirely in keeping with the concept of an active foreign policy which most people in this country share. It is also in keeping with the belief that, however unpalatable it may be, there are occasions when the use of armed force is necessary to make or protect or keep peace. Ultimately, there are occasions when, even though it might be unpalatable, we need armed forces to vindicate the human and civil rights of ordinary people. We should ponder this in the context of the debates to be held in the House this week. It is not enough to be in favour of human and civil rights. We must be prepared to act in support, defence and vindication of those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extend my good wishes to the Irish personnel who will be involved in this mission, both those who will be part of the contingent that is due to <Col N="71" /> leave shortly and those who will participate in the second contingent which the Minister mentioned as a possibility in four months time. At the same time I remind the House that our defence forces have found increasing difficulty in recent years in filling contingents for peacekeeping duties overseas. It is no secret that it has become more and more difficult to ensure that our contingents are up to strength. The reasons for that are simple. Many members of the defence forces have a substantial number of missions of this kind under their belt. It is difficult to ask people who have already served on a number of occasions to go away from their families again and expose themselves to danger. Although they have never been reluctant to go, it is difficult to ask them to expose their families to the worry of having their loved ones away for a considerable period and all the other difficulties that arise as a result.</P>
    <P>This is a symptom of a serious personnel problem in our defence forces. We do not have sufficient personnel to comfortably meet the calls made on us or match the contribution we want to make. It is important to emphasise that now when we are expecting, in the near future, the publication of a White Paper on defence policy. I hope the Government is conscious of what it means that we are finding it difficult to fill contingents and that there will be positive action to address that in the White Paper. What it means, in simple straightforward terms is, we need more members in the defence forces and more people trained for the kind of operations that are involved here.</P>
    <P>Parallel with an increase in personnel there is a crying need for investment in equipment. I know armoured personnel carriers are on order. Deputy Fitzgerald reminded us of the delivery time for the current order. I am sure the Minister will say that things are being done as quickly as possible but the defence forces have been waiting too long for that equipment. It is only one of the many items of equipment they need. They need more equipment and they need it now to enable them carry out the duties we are asking them to do in a way they, as professional soldiers, would like to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned that apart from combat and mobility equipment we need to provide contingents that have abilities in logistics and signals. On the logistics side, we recently acquired some material for the KFOR force but, as far as I understand, all the equipment for that operation is now in use. We could not do that anywhere else without acquiring new equipment quickly.</P>
    <P>Our defence forces have no tactical airlift capacity of any kind, which a defence force like ours would need. It would be idle to speak of strategic airlift capacity. The Minister will contradict me if I am wrong but a substantial part of the operation of supplying Irish contingents to the Lebanon is by sea. When a supply mission of that kind is undertaken it immediately impacts on the level of activity we have in patrolling Irish waters. These are the kinds of problems of capacity that <Col N="72" /> we require our defence forces to deal with, day in, day out, and we are selling them short.</P>
    <P>Our participation in this operation is yet another reason for joining the partnership for peace. I have no doubt that this Irish contingent will acquit itself extremely well as Irish contingents in these operations always have but it is significant to note that it will be operating as part of the New Zealand battalion. It is a small contingent. Nonetheless it is useful and the operation will undoubtedly add to the level of expertise available for the defence forces in operations of this kind. This operation makes the point very clearly for those who want to see that the kinds of operations envisaged in our presentation to the partnership for peace are an essential part of day to day training and activity for the defence forces. If we are to have the capacity to train and hone the skills of our defence forces in the way that is required we will have to have a force of a size that will train and sustain the kinds of operations involved here. If membership of partnership for peace is to have any real meaning we must have that minimum critical mass in the defence forces to use it effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is on record as saying there will be no budgetary consequences from our membership of the partnership for peace. If that is the Government's view and approach to the matter then we will seriously undersell ourselves and let our defence forces down again in the process. To participate properly in the Partnership for Peace and in UN operations, to ensure maximum benefit for the purposes of the operations in which we are involved and the maximum addition to the skills and expertise of our defence forces we must provide the equipment required for the operations envisaged and ensure that our personnel levels are adequate to maintain the kind of training required.</P>
    <P>Irish and other European troops will be involved in East Timor, half a world away from them, as will US and Canadian troops. There were serious problems in the past in providing peacekeeping forces in Africa and Asia, to which other speakers referred. The UN has an enormous job to do in encouraging the development of regional organisations under its charter so that problems which arise in Africa and Asia can be dealt with expeditiously by forces originating in those areas. No matter how committed, enthusiastic or well-disposed we may be, it is extremely difficult for armed forces to work well half a world away from their countries of origin, and we will see that in East Timor. That is not, in any sense, to criticise or undervalue what is being undertaken but we must be realistic and look at regional operations under the umbrella of the UN.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Ahern. We are debating a serious motion of substance regarding the future use of our defence forces. Members of the defence forces, whether from the navy or army, cannot be <Col N="73" /> dispatched and sent on foreign missions unless the approval of this House has been secured in advance. If the House was not in session, for example during the summer recess, it would have had to be recalled to approve sending members of the defence forces abroad on foreign missions under the auspices of the United Nations. I fully support the motion. In essence, it approves sending more than 40 Irish Army personnel to take part in what is known as the INTERFET mission in East Timor. This is in accordance with the United Nations Resolution 1264 which was approved by the United Nations Security Council on 15 September last.</P>
      <P>The new leader of Indonesia, President Habibie, declared his intention to hold a referendum on East Timor and allow the people of East Timor to decide whether they wanted to support independence. This commitment was given earlier this year and the referendum was scheduled for the end of August. The United Nations agreed to send a monitor force to East Timor, known as UNIFIL, which was put in place to guarantee that these elections would take place in a spirit of democracy and universal suffrage, and that is what happened when the elections took place. Eighty per cent of the East Timorese population voted once again for independence. This independence had been taken from them by force in 1975. Within hours of the result, however, all hell broke loose. Pro-Indonesian military forces, backed in part by elements of the Indonesian army, began a rampage of looting, murder and general destruction. It appeared at one stage that the Indonesian government may have been forced not to recognise the result due to pressure from within its own army ranks.</P>
      <P>The credibility of the United Nations was at stake because it had sponsored an election which was in danger of being nullified by force. On 15 September last, by means of Resolution 1264 of the United Nations, the UN-backed security presence in East Timor, known as INTERFET, was born. INTERFET continues to conduct operations aimed at improving the security situation in East Timor. INTERFET forces deployed in East Timor now number about 5,400, of which there are approximately 1,300 personnel from many countries. These include Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. INTERFET is also overseeing, in part, the reconstruction of Dili, the main population centre in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>INTERFET was sent into East Timor because of the deteriorating security situation in the country. This was fully recognised in Resolution 1264 which also took cognisance of the responsibility of the United Nations to enforce the democratic decision of the people of East Timor of 30 August. INTERFET is also in place to reaffirm the right of refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes. We must remember that on 12 September, President Habibie of Indonesia <Col N="74" /> stated that he was willing to accept an international peacekeeping force, under the auspices of the United Nations, into East Timor. INTERFET has helped to reduce the level of violence in East Timor although the violence has not totally subsided. There is need for a greater co-ordinated humanitarian response to the problems in East Timor and the safe and unimpeded access by humanitarian organisations must be permitted into East Timor to oversee this important humanitarian exercise.</P>
    <P>From an Irish perspective, we should support the resolution because it comes within the overall parameters of Irish foreign policy. Ever since we joined the United Nations in 1955, we have taken part in humanitarian peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the UN. This included missions in the Congo and Cyprus while we currently have more than 600 troops permanently based in Lebanon. The Irish Army has observers in the western Sahara and, until recently, had observers in Angola, while members of the Army are also based in the OSCE. The difficulties in the many states that made up the Former Republic of Yugoslavia have also required substantial UN intervention. The Dayton peace agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia, included proposals to send a substantial peacekeeping force to the region to implement the provisions of the peace agreement. This force is known as the SFOR operation and more than 50 Irish Army personnel are currently taking part in that mission. This year we witnessed the awful war which took place in Kosovo. Once again, international intervention was required to implement the peace agreement which was put into effect to end the Kosovo war. Another peacekeeping force known as KFOR is now in operation and more than 100 Irish Army personnel are taking part in this peacekeeping, humanitarian and reconstruction mission in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>In many cases, these regional conflicts have brought about the need for peacekeeping operations to be brought into effect. Irish Army personnel can play an active and constructive part in bringing together the various aspects of such peace agreements which need to be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate which relates to sending Irish troops to East Timor. Since 1958, Irish peacekeepers and military observers have participated in 46,000 individual tours of duty involving 37 UN peacekeeping missions. Over the past 41 years, the Irish Defence Forces have garnered the highest accolades due to their professionalism, fairness and commonsense. The rangers and the other personnel who will be sent to East Timor will continue to uphold those high standards on their tour of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Taoiseach took a proactive role following the outbreak of atrocities in East Timor. They contacted a number of their counter<Col N="75" /> parts to mobilise international support for the establishment of a multinational force. Ireland also pursued the matter directly at the United Nations Security Council in calling for the establishment of such a force. From a layman's perspective, the standing of the UN has decreased because it only seems to react when violence erupts even though, in many cases, such violence is predicted. Changes need to be brought about in the UN. I am proud that Ireland is not standing idly by while another nation is being subjected to murder, pillage and destruction. The numbers of personnel we are sending to East Timor may not be large but we are sending a signal that Ireland cares about this problem and that actions speak louder than words.</P>
    <P>I join the other Members who praised Tom Hyland who, for many years, highlighted the problems in East Timor. His tenacity shows that one person can make a difference. I wish him continued success in his mission. Trócaire, GOAL and Concern deserve our praise also because they have come into the breach at a time of need. I ask people to support these worthy organisations which are doing so much good for those in need. Another issue which needs to be highlighted is the trade in armaments. This is a massive industry to which we can shut our eyes but we must not do that. It is our moral duty to continue to raise the immorality of the arms trade throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government is evidence of its readiness to play a full part in addressing the humanitarian, political and security challenges arising from the crisis in East Timor. I extend my good wishes to those members of the Defence Forces who will travel to East Timor. I hope they will all come home safely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this praiseworthy motion. This is a token force but, nevertheless, it is a meaningful contribution to the attempt to solve the problem on hand, which is considerable. I do not know whether this has been referred to or whether people share my view, but in Indonesia we are dealing with a totally different type of civilisation and politics. It is not democracy as we know it &ndash; the army calls the shots. From news reports, it appears that President Habibie's position is in jeopardy because of his agreement to hold a referendum in which the people of East Timor decided their fate. The result of the referendum went against the wishes of the hardliners in the Indonesian Government, particularly the army generals. If he is deposed and the army asserts itself, as it can quite easily do, the future will be very bleak for East and West Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to see how the proposed 8,000 troops in INTERFET will be able to deal with the situation because there is a standing army in Indonesia of 400,000. To date, only 5,300 of the INTERFET forces are in position in East Timor. If the militants in the Indonesian regime get their way, the people in that area will face an awful future. <Col N="76" /> There will be no future for the United Nations forces because one cannot compete with an army of that size in that type of terrain. It would not be a viable option.</P>
    <P>The Australians are providing the backbone of the force. Some South-East Asian countries are also providing a significant number of personnel and we are providing a smaller number. However, the great powers, particularly the United States, are not going to get involved. They have had their fill of trying to plug holes all over the world where there are tyrants and vicious regimes, such as Pol Pot in Cambodia and, more recently, the Balkans. They are no longer going to get involved in these conflicts &ndash; they had enough of that in Vietnam &ndash; and it is hard to see anyone else filling the void.</P>
    <P>There were frightening pictures on television last week of the Chinese celebrating the 50th anniversary of their liberation. They were frightening displays, in that its armed forces are so huge. It also makes its presence felt on the Security Council in terms of thwarting others from trying to do what is necessary in these troubled parts of the world. However, what, in reality, is China doing to try to resolve any conflict, particularly this one which is so close to it? Has anyone asked why China is not playing a part in providing some humanitarian aid and physical assistance to people who are being downtrodden, murdered and raped, instead of strutting its military power in public? It is a disgrace. The Chinese, along with the Russians, criticised KFOR when it went into Kosovo to sort out the slaughter that was going on there. We must get our priorities right and pinpoint the people who are not playing their part. As small as the part we are playing is, it is a significant effort.</P>
    <P>The days of the West getting involved in these situations are coming to an end because people are not prepared to see tens of thousands of their soldiers being killed in what many of them regard as futile exercises. I do not regard this as futile, but many countries which do not have our record of trying to help others in need would look upon it as futile. They would regard the Cambodian situation and all the wars which are still raging in Africa, such as in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Liberia and even Algeria as futile. They do not want to get caught in the middle of a no win situation.</P>
    <P>If we are to resolve the situation in Timor, East Timor should not be taken in isolation. The UN mandate should be extended to include West Timor. We know from reports that there are approximately 230,000 East Timorese in concentration camps in West Timor. The word &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; has been used but it is clearly not correct. According to a television report yesterday, soldiers in the Indonesian army, primarily, and the pro-Indonesian militias which have caused so much havoc, are rampaging through these camps, day and night, raping and killing as they wish. Who is doing anything to stop that? The remit of <Col N="77" /> the United Nations is merely to take back East Timor and conform with the result of the referendum. However, there is just as major a problem in West Timor.</P>
    <P>Who will have these people brought before a war tribunal for the crimes they are committing against humanity? Will General Wiranto, the leader of the Indonesian army, the President or the other army personnel involved be apprehended and brought before a tribunal? We see how difficult that is in Bosnia. It would be much more difficult in terrain such as Indonesia and Timor. I would like the Minister to refer to this in his reply. What sanctions are going to be taken against the people who have been murdering, maiming and raping at will for years?</P>
    <P>This goes back to 1974, when the Portuguese, who should never have been there in the first place, left East Timor. They left it in disarray and allowed the situation to arise where the Indonesians were able to walk in, take over and persecute people for 25 years. Nobody has ever been prosecuted for the atrocities that occurred in that time. This has not been happening for just the past two or three months or since the referendum was held in August, but for 25 years. I would like that point to be raised with the Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has done an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Everyone associated with or knowledgeable about the Timorese situation agrees that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, has done an excellent job. Ireland, given its size, has been particularly vigilant and to the forefront in bringing the issue to the front of world affairs and to the attention of the world community. We, in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, have met Tom Hyland and his associates who have done wonderful work on behalf of East Timor. We would not know what is happening there if it were not for their bravery and diligence. The non-governmental agencies, such as Trócaire, GOAL, Concern and others, have also done great work.</P>
    <P>It is up to us to keep highlighting the injustices that are taking place out there and to see that the 230,000 people in concentration camps in West Timor are allowed return. They were dragged and hunted out. We saw them being driven off in lorries. They were afraid to speak to television reporters or to face the television cameras because they knew the sanction for so doing would be death. Many of them were killed. We have a duty to see that the mandate is extended to West Timor.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the full backing of this House. We appreciate the work being done by the Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and also to welcome, <Col N="78" /> once again, the readiness of the Army to contribute to what has been a consistent policy, which is much recognised and respected throughout the world, since our first undertaking in the Congo almost 50 years ago. This fact demonstrates beyond doubt that there is no barrier to the Army contributing to peacekeeping under current arrangements. It is significant that we have the seventh highest level of peacekeeping commitment in the world and, in terms of our size, that means we have proportionately the highest level of peacekeeping commitment in the civilised world. That is a vindication of our consistent foreign policy over the years and of the readiness of our Defence Forces and successive Governments to make that commitment. I say that because there are some who have retired from the Army and who, acting as spokesmen, imply that we have a disability, that we cannot fulfil a fully effective peacekeeping role, if we do not enter into other organisations such as that which we will debate tomorrow. This motion demonstrates that we can and do, and that the world community especially welcomes Ireland in that role. I know that, in terms of the professional capacity of the first troops to go out, the Ranger corps, whom I was pleased to meet on a professional level two or three years ago, it is a well equipped and committed elite corps and I have no doubt it will further enhance the role and status of the Army in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, I note in the course of the debate so far that there has been an understandable tendency to blame the United Nations for what people see as the belated response to the awful oppressive brutality which has been inflicted on the innocent wretches of East Timor by a brutal Indonesian regime over the past 20 years. It is too easy to blame the United Nations. We can target the blame much more precisely because, for the past 20 or more years, the United States, for example, has supplied the brutal Indonesian regime with the armaments which helped it maintain its oppressive hold over the innocent wretches in East Timor and the United Kingdom has supplied that brutal oppressive regime with the armaments which enabled it to inflict unspeakable horrors on the innocent people in East Timor. These facts have been known throughout the world. We do not need the intelligence services of either the British Government, the American Government or many European Governments which were major players in the armaments export trade &ndash; that unspeakable trade of death. They knew &ndash; if we knew, they certainly knew &ndash; what the oppressive Indonesian regime was up to. It is a little off the mark to blame the United Nations, which is the world community of nations, when we know the supporters and suppliers of arms for this brutal regime. Incidentally, other brutal regimes around the world, which are not now at the same stage as Indonesia but whose problems will surface tomorrow or the day after, are being supplied with the weaponry of death, destruction and suf<Col N="79" /> fering by countries which are democratic and are friends and partners in many ways. We owe it to the world, as a small nation with a consistent voice, to speak out against this kind of unspeakable trade which has caused the problems in countries such as East Timor.</P>
    <P>The world woke up and became aware of what was happening. About four weeks ago, we belatedly received statements from the British and American Governments and others, but those two particularly. It was as if they had only then become aware. In my experience, the Democratic Party Administrations in the United States have had a much more sensitive awareness of this type of issue than their Republican Party predecessors. I especially commend the former President Jimmy Carter for that. The current President is probably much more sensitive to it than some of his Republican predecessors. However, President Clinton belatedly stated about four weeks ago that the Indonesian Government and military are responsible for the East Timorese and the UN mission there and that, if Indonesia did not end the violence, it must invite the international community to assist in restoring security. They were the very ones who created the violence and who supported the brutal militia and they are now the ones to invite us to assist in restoring security. Those who caused the violence are to ask us to restore security. I find that, to say the least, a little cynical and a little contradictory.</P>
    <P>Indonesia has been one of the constant beneficiaries of the export of small arms &ndash; that is the term used for anything short of nuclear weaponry &ndash; weaponry, ammunition and their components. I find it extraordinary that those who supplied them find that Indonesia has been undergoing an important democratic transformation recently. They say this when they have intelligence services and know the reality. What was the response of the British Government when they held their big international trade fair in the past four to five weeks? It withdrew the invitation to the Indonesians who were welcome visitors and purchasers every other time. This is the opportunity for us to say that we reject that type of scandalous international trade where the victims are always the same. The Minister stated that East Timor was devastated as result of pro-Indonesian military activity and the destruction caused by departing Indonesian security forces. From where did they get the weaponry for that destruction and brutality? I would like to see that addressed.</P>
    <P>We will not change the brutal regime in Indonesia. Its spots will not be scrubbed off. One thing we can do is to ensure that the Indonesian regime, which, as the Minister pointed out, forced the predecessor of this organisation, UNAMET, to be retrenched in the face of the violence against its personnel and facilities, is no longer supplied with the arms which enabled it to do that. I hope our presence here will enable us to speak out even more loudly against those who <Col N="80" /> supply that unspeakable weaponry of death to brutal regimes such as Indonesia and of which there are many more throughout the world.</P>

      <P>I support the motion for the dispatch of a force from this State for service in East Timor under a United Nations mandate. The Irish people have been to the fore among those worldwide who expressed solidarity with and have given practical help to the East Timorese people long before the latest crisis in their history.</P>
      <P>I understand that Tom Hyland, who is travelling from Darwin to East Timor tomorrow, has raised a number of important issues which need to be factored into our discussions this evening. What needs to be pointed out most urgently is that the genocide has not stopped. The East Timor (Ireland) Solidarity Campaign reports that more than 200,000 East Timorese people have been forced out of their country and are held in concentration camps in West Timor. These camps are being run by the very people who wreaked so much havoc during and since the referendum. It is reported that there are very few men in these camps and the fear is that thousands have been killed. The people of East Timor are also being exiled to other parts of eastern Indonesia. This is part of an official Indonesian policy as expressed by the Indonesian Minister for Transmigration. The people are not being given a choice to return to East Timor and are being exiled in fear of their lives. An estimated $27 million has been allocated by Indonesia for this forced exile.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to assure the House that Irish taxpayers' money, either through IMF or the World Bank, will not be used to finance this forced transmigration programme of the Indonesian Government against the people of East Timor. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and ask the Taoiseach to instruct the Minister for Finance, to get a written agreement from the IMF and World Bank on this.</P>
      <P>The INTERFET mandate only covers East Timor and the UN Resolution places responsibility for repatriation of refugees on the Indonesian government. The Jakarta regime cannot be trusted to return these people. Pressure must be placed on them to ensure that refugees are placed under international protection, that is, under the protection of the Irish and other UN forces. I urge the Government to fully support and promote the demands of the East Timor (Ireland) Solidarity Campaign, including a repatriation agreement with full access to West Timor for UNHCR and other agencies, humanitarian assistance and a humanitarian corridor between West and East Timor to allow refugees to return safely.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am opposed to this motion. The last thing the people of East Timor need now is more military units. Conor O'Clery, Asia correspondent to <i>The Irish Times</i>, wrote a few days ago on 7 October: </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> East Timor has been reduced to a wasteland. Public buildings are in ruins. The food distribution system is non-existent. The telephone, electricity and water supplies are in danger of collapse. The roads are in an advanced state of disintegration. Almost everything of value, from cars to television sets, has been looted.</P>
    <P>And we propose to send a number of soldiers. What the people of East Timor need now is massive reconstruction, food, medicine, shelter, heat and, of course, self-government.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of Australian soldiers in East Timor, and the Australian and United States governments are attempting to portray themselves as the saviour and friend of the East Timorese people. The nightmare for the people of East Timor &ndash; I say it calculatedly &ndash; would never have occurred if the United States and Australia had not, from the inception of the dictatorship, supported that dictatorship, given it aid, arms and comfort, from the bloody coup in 1975 which saw one million people slaughtered by General Suharto, according to the CIA, one of the worst mass murder campaigns of the twentieth century and one of the ghastliest and most concentrated bloodletting of current times. The United States, since that day, has supported the Indonesians, has given them arms, and so has Australia. When they went in, in 1975 to crush the rights of the people of East Timor, they were also supported by the United States and by the Australians. Only a matter of weeks after another bloody massacre of the people, of 270 men, women and children in November 1991, they signed contracts in relation to massive oil reserves that were divided up between the Australians, the United States oil companies and Indonesia, putting into effect the Timor Gap Treaty which was robbery of the resources of the East Timorese people. The militias were straw men created by the Indonesians. They would not exist but for the arms that were sent by Britain and the United States to arm Indonesia.</P>
    <P>What are the needs of the people of East Timor? They want independence. Why does this Government not give official recognition to East Timor? That should be done immediately. They want protection, but when the people of East Timor needed guns and arms to protect themselves, where were the arms manufactured by the so-called democracies of the United States and Britain? They were in the hands of the Indonesians and the militias. I call for a democratic defence force of the people of East Timor themselves who can save themselves from the nightmare. I call for their self-determination and a constituent assembly freely elected by those people. I am alarmed at talk of putting that back years. That was not the aspiration of the Irish people when we had to fight a brutal empire here as well.</P>
    <P>The fundamental agenda of Australia and the United States is to protect the economic interests of their multinational oil companies and other <Col N="82" /> interests, not primarily to defend the people. If the democratic will of the East Timorese people is to take into public ownership those oil reserves, they will come up against the opposition of Australia and the United States. What should we send? The Irish people will agree to sent funds, but we should send it in the form of massive reconstruction, equipment and skilled personnel, engineers, skilled building workers, materials, heating appliances and so forth, and hospital and medical personnel, doctors, nurses and medicines. That is how we can as a people, assist the people who have been so brutalised, not in the way that is being proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their valuable contributions. There was virtually unanimous support for the motion up to the end when Deputy Higgins made his contribution and, obviously, he is entitled to his view as well.</P>
      <P>Ireland is increasingly being called upon to participate in United Nations mandated multinational peacekeeping and peace support operations set up to address crises and to help to contain conflicts. The oppression of a people, genocide, ethnic cleansing or whatever, all present a challenge to countries such as Ireland that are spared such barbarities and which are in a position to offer help through participation in such missions under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's willingness to participate in missions such as INTERFET in East Timor is motivated as much by a firm belief in the obligation on the international community to play a part in helping our fellow human beings in times of trouble as by the terrible sense of outrage which situations such as that in East Timor provoke in our minds. We feel we have a moral imperative to respond. Participation in INTERFET is an expression of solidarity by Ireland with the people of East Timor. It shows a willingness on our part to live up to the ideals and principles of the charter of the United Nations. Security and democracy go hand in hand. The horrendous violence visited upon the people of East Timor as they seek to pursue their legitimate right to self-determination through democratic means has stunned people everywhere.</P>
      <P>In many places in the world, armed conflicts have caused and continue to cause great human suffering. Tragic examples in recent times are Rwanda in 1994 and Kosovo this year. People have been killed, maimed and expelled. The trauma among those who survive the violence deepens hatreds and rifts between people. Humanitarian tasks go hand in hand with military tasks in such crises. The multi-functional nature of UN mandated peacekeeping in recent years facilitates to a much greater degree than hitherto, civil military co-operation, including co-operation in the humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Deputies referred to human rights violations. The UN Secretary-General has asked the High Commissioner Mrs. Robinson to establish a commission of inquiry and for it to report by the end of December. This Government welcomes and fully supports this approach. It was a commission of inquiry that led to the establishment of the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia. The commission of inquiry for East Timor could lead to a similar conclusion, and the report is expected at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The refugees in West Timor were referred to. As a result of international pressure Indonesia has started to give access to international agencies and to allow refugees to return. The Government believes this pressure must be maintained for as long as it is necessary and continues to press this view at international fora.</P>
    <P>INTERFET is a challenging mission. One cannot downplay the inherent risks involved. Safety of Defence Forces personnel serving in missions such as INTERFET is always a matter of priority. In recommending that the Irish contribute a contingent to INTERFET, I am cognisant of the current assessment of risk attaching to this mission as advised by the military recognisance party which visited the area from 19 to 30 September 1999, and I will continue to be briefed on the ongoing risk assessments. While no guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in any missions overseas, particularly missions such as INTERFET, it is my policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. I am satisfied that the proposed role of the contingent of Defence Forces personnel which will serve with INTERFET is in keeping with their training and experience to date. I am also satisfied that they will be well briefed and will have undergone the necessary acclimatisation in Australia before being deployed to the mission in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to a point made by Deputy Higgins, in our experience it is impossible to carry out work in any of the war torn countries where we have served under the UN unless there is a semblance of peace and normality. It is not possible to talk about infrastructural development on any wide scale until such time as a sense of peace has been restored and where people are free to return to their homes.</P>
    <P>I again thank all the Deputies who contributed. Deputy Kenny referred to those countries who supply armaments and warfaring facilities to the countries concerned. This has been raised by the Government at international fora and the hypocrisy involved must be attacked at every forum.</P>

      <P>Since the foundation of the State, nurses have been the least militant group in the public service in the fraught areas of industrial relations and pay negotiations. Their almost unanimous vote for strike action is a consequence of a gross failure of management skills at Government level. The strike now fixed to commence next Tuesday, if it takes place, will rock the foundations of our public health service and will have disastrous consequences for many patients originally scheduled for surgery in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The inability of the Minister's representatives, the Health Service Employers Agency, to agree with the Nursing Alliance treatment protocols for the care of patients during the pending strike, should it take place, compounds the tragic difficulties with which those who require hospital care are confronted. The withdrawal of public health nurses from their community duties presents a serious threat to the health and well-being of many of our elderly within local communities whose health is dependent on their regular visits.</P>
      <P>The effects of this damaging dispute are already being felt. Patients are being sent home from hospitals, hospital beds are being left vacant, scheduled operations are being cancelled, people with life threatening illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, are being told that essential in-patient hospital procedures are either being postponed or cannot be scheduled. It should never have come to this, but it has because of the gross incompetence of the Minister for Health and Children and his failure to play a proactive role in the running of our health service.</P>
      <P>The nursing dispute should be put in context, it cannot be understood in isolation. As at 30 June last, 34,000 patients were waiting for in-patient hospital treatment during the term of office of the Minister and at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity. The public in-patient hospital waiting lists grew from 29,000 to 36,500. In June 34,000 patients were affected, 5,000 more than at the date of the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the waiting lists effected between December 1998 and June 1999 resulted in both health boards and hospitals across the country exceeding their Department-allocated service plan expenditure. As a consequence, theatres, wards and beds were closed during the period June to September 1999 resulting in a loss <Col N="86" /> of 35,463 bed days. Operating theatres and beds, which could have been used to confront the waiting list crisis, were taken out of commission in a cost-cutting exercise at a time when the State's Exchequer surplus was double that originally predicted by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement last December. In the first eight months of this year a total of 53,982 bed days have been lost in our hospitals. The number lost in the June to September period amounts to 65 per cent of the overall total bed days lost to date in 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition to existing theatres, in use for many years, temporarily closing, there is the scandal of newly constructed theatres and hospital units not being utilised. Limerick Regional Hospital has two main operating theatres out of a total of seven and one day theatre out of two in operation. In addition, two renal dialysis stations, which have been available for occupation since 1998, have still not been brought into use. In the same hospital two radiology rooms, which have been available since December 1998, also remain unused. As at the end of June, 1,570 patients were on the hospital's waiting lists.</P>
    <P>University College Hospital Galway has two operating theatres out of a total of nine available for occupation since October 1998, one 26 bed ward available for occupation for use since March 1999, ten observation beds in accident and emergency available for use since June 1999 and two X-ray rooms out of a total of seven available since May 1999. None of these facilities has been brought into use. At the end of June 1999 the hospital had 2,867 patients on its waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Tallaght Hospital has four theatres out of 12 uncommissioned since its opening in June 1998. Other units also remain either unused or under-utilised. At the end of June 1999 the hospital had an in-patient hospital waiting list of 1,658. If a private business invested substantial moneys in the construction of additional facilities and left them unused for such a long period of time, either the business would collapse in financial difficulties or the management would be sacked and replaced.</P>
    <P>At a time of economic plenty not only are the hospital waiting lists escalating again, but the times people must wait for essential operations in a number of the national target specialities is also increasing. Some 75 per cent of adults who require cardiac surgery must wait between 12 months and two years for essential life saving operations; 79 per cent of children awaiting cardiac surgery must wait for in excess of six months, some for between one to two years; 65 per cent of those awaiting vascular surgery must wait between 12 months and two years; and 52 per cent of adults awaiting orthopaedic surgery must wait between 12 months and three years. Last June 470 adults who fall into this category were waiting total hip replacement operations and 340 were waiting for total knee replacement operations. More than 2,000 other adults were awaiting other orthopaedic procedures. Some 78 <Col N="87" /> per cent of children awaiting orthopaedic procedures must also wait between six months and two years; 55 per cent of adults awaiting ENT &ndash; ear, nose and throat procedures &ndash; must wait between 12 months and two years and 68 per cent of children awaiting ENT procedures must wait between six months and three years. Last June this included 1,120 children awaiting tonsillectomies.</P>
    <P>This is just a selection of the waiting times being experienced by adults and children waiting life-saving or pain-ending operations. Those people are leading diminished lifestyles as a consequence of the State's inability to provide them with the medical service to which they are entitled. These waiting times are the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children who, in his third year of office, has abysmally failed to achieve waiting time objectives that should have by now been readily achieved. Public hospital objectives are that no child should wait more than six months for essential surgery and that no adult should wait more than 12 months. While endorsing these objectives, the Minister has proved so incapable of properly managing his Department there is no possibility they will be achieved during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is the contribution of a Minister for Health and Children who has in recent weeks been talking confrontation rather than consultation with nurses. He and his colleagues have the audacity to accuse nurses of putting patients' lives at risk. By his gross incompetence, lack of commitment and lack of management skills, the Minister put the lives of hundreds of patients at risk as he has complacently presided over the continuing waiting list crisis. This from a Minister for Health and Children who should have, if he was properly managing his Department and on top of his brief, anticipated the concerns of nurses and the difficulties under the public spotlight in recent days, and should have many months ago engaged in dialogue and put in place structures which would have addressed the outstanding concerns of the nursing profession and ensured that what could potentially be a disastrous strike did not occur within a week.</P>
    <P>Public discussion in recent days has focused on the nurses' rejection of the recent Labour Court recommendations. However, the difficulties within nursing and the problems being experienced within our hospitals did not start with the Labour Court recommendations last September. It does not require great insight to recognise that nurses generally believe the fundamental manner in which their profession has changed is still not fully recognised and that their skills are under-valued. The dramatic changes that have occurred in nursing are well documented in the report of the Commission on Nursing, as are the further substantial changes envisaged that will occur in the implementation of the 200 recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>Well before the recent vote on the Labour <Col N="88" /> Court recommendations and the nurses strike ballot, the growing nursing shortages in major hospitals responsible for national specialities clearly illustrated this fact. The shortages are particularly acute within the Eastern Health Board region. The extent of the difficulties was well posted in surveys undertaken by the Health Service Employers Agency in the first part of this year. At the end of April last, the Mater Hospital had a shortfall of 67 nurses; Beaumont Hospital a shortfall of 60 nurses; St. James's Hospital a shortfall of 35 nurses and St. Vincent's Hospital a shortfall of 44 nurses. The April nursing shortages do not reveal the full story. Within the particular hospitals concerned, the shortages were not simply of nursing numbers but of nurses with specialist qualifications, trained to participate in complex and lifesaving surgery. The consequences of the nursing shortages are that hospitals with major national specialties have been unable to operate at their maximum potential and have fallen short of completing the numbers of crucial operations which they originally anticipated could be undertaken by them. For example, the Mater Hospital, due to nursing shortages last year, fell short of its target number of open heart surgery operations, performing 873 against a target of 1,000.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember, as we focus on the statistics and the numbers, that for each statistic given, for each number given, there are patients who fear for their lives, there are patients in pain, patients in general hospitals for many weeks awaiting transfers to hospitals who specialise in targeted specialities. For every seriously ill person awaiting inpatient hospital treatment, there are family members &ndash; wives, children, mothers, fathers, grandchildren, aunts and uncles &ndash; who await anxiously the provision of essential medical care. For every patient on the hospital waiting lists there is also the knowledge that if they could afford private medical insurance, or if they were financially better off, instead of waiting months and years, surgical and medical treatment which they require could be undertaken within a matter of days. For them there is the knowledge that at a time of extraordinary economic prosperity, we have a Minister for Health and Children who is prepared to sit on the sidelines and institutionalise a two tier health service &ndash; one for the rich, one for the lesser well off.</P>
    <P>Nursing shortages in our hospitals nationally, which totalled 566 last April, have grown worse since then. It is estimated that they currently exceed 800. During the April to October period there have been further beds and theatres closed as a consequence of nursing shortages. The Mater Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin are among the hospitals that have had to close beds and function with reduced theatre capacity. Nurses have been walking away from our public health care service, going to better paid and lesser pressurised employments. Pharmaceutical companies are offering well qualified nurses salaries they will never achieve <Col N="89" /> within our public health care system. Hospital and medical services outside the State are also offering Irish nurses opportunities of which they could never avail in the State and the possibility of working in a less pressurised environment with greater ancillary support services.</P>
    <P>Confronted by the nursing shortages last April, the Minister behaved in his usual manner &ndash; he did nothing. He simply watched the nursing crisis develop. Astonishingly, he did not even take steps to ensure that there would be available to him and to his Department current information on the extent of the nursing shortages, indicating whether the position was deteriorating or improving. When asked, by way of parliamentary question, by me on 29 September last upon the Dáil reconvening after the summer recess, to detail the nursing vacancies in each hospital and within each health board area and the specialities to which the vacancies related, the Minister's response was that the most recent survey of nursing vacancies related to the position at the end of April 1999. As a consequence of the parliamentary question, he replied that he would ask the Health Service Employers Agency to carry out a further study of the position as at the end of September. This Minister, confronted by growing nursing shortages for more than a year and knowing the shortages to be damaging the capacity of major hospitals to undertake crucial specialised surgical procedures, did not even have the wit to ensure the situation was being monitored.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, by crass and insensitive comment, exacerbated, rather than ameliorated, the current difficulties. The time that elapsed between the date of the nurses rejecting the recent Labour Court recommendations and the results of the strike ballot, afforded a window of opportunity to the Government to enter into dialogue with the nursing unions to find a formula to resolve the present dispute. The Government chose instead to launch a public campaign to vilify nurses. In doing so, it not only further alienated nurses, but soured the atmosphere to a degree that it has to date tragically proved impossible to put in place a treatment protocol detailing the arrangements to apply in our hospitals should a strike take place. The behaviour of the Government to date guaranteed that nurses would overwhelmingly vote in favour of strike action. By acting like bully boys and lager louts, Government Ministers stung nurses into casting more votes in favour of strike action than were originally cast in rejection of the Labour Court recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is essential a formula is now found to resolve the nursing dispute. If the strike proceeds, in so far as is possible, national treatment protocols should be agreed to ensure essential care to patients whose lives are at risk. However, even at this late stage, the nurses strike should not be regarded as inevitable. Time remains to pull back from the brink. Seven days remain during which constructive dialogue can be undertaken to agree <Col N="90" /> a resolution of this dispute. It is the solemn duty and responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to use these seven days wisely and constructively. Sadly, to date, the Minister has failed to behave either wisely or constructively and has essentially abdicated his public duty. A strike is only inevitable if the Minister continues to do nothing and he and his colleagues in Government continue to target and vilify nurses. It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance has to date shown more compassion and consideration for alleged Ansbacher tax evaders and non-residential deposit account tax fraudsters than he has for our nurses. The more conciliatory tone of the Taoiseach which was partially evident this afternoon was in marked contrast to that of the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance. The communication breakdown between the Government and nurses must be remedied.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael calls on the Government to immediately enter into constructive dialogue with the nursing unions. If such dialogue commences, Fine Gael asks that a cooling-off period be agreed to facilitate a resolution of this most damaging dispute before strike action is implemented. Fine Gael asks all Members of this House, including all opposition parties and all Independent Deputies, to support its motion in the vote tomorrow night to force the Government to finally enter into a constructive dialogue which may at the eleventh hour allow us to avoid this very damaging strike occurring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach and the Government stand indicted for not doing anything to avert the nurses strike. On the contrary, the negative statements from the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government have aggravated the situation. It appears that the Minister for Health and Children deliberately went out of his way to ensure that the nurses would ballot for strike action. Is the Minister aware that he has a statutory obligation to ensure proper cover in hospitals? At the moment there is not adequate cover in hospitals, even before the strike takes place. There are 37,000 people currently on waiting lists even though wards are closed. The Minister has allowed no leeway for discussion but has simply closed the door on any talks with the nurses. This dispute must be settled by dialogue, therefore the Minister should enter into dialogue straight away.</P>
      <P>At University Hospital Galway, the casualty department has been overcrowded, night casualty has been overcrowded on a regular basis over the past two weeks, yet two new wards which have been completed since May have not been opened. One-third of the nurses at this hospital are temporary and the hospital management are not replacing nurses on sick leave and are letting temporary nurses go in order to break their service. This dispute has now reached a serious point and I challenge the Minister of State who is present and who represents the constituency, what he intends to do about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> Nurses will not be paid during the strike. They will provide emergency cover without pay. In the Western Health Board area there are about 1,000 nurses in acute hospitals, 250 in district and in community work and about 700 psychiatric nurses. If the duration of the strike is for one month, up to £2 million will be saved in nurses' wages alone in the Western Health Board area. This seems to suit the Minister who this time last year refused to give the Western Health Board £1 million to continue its services for the last two months of the year. The same situation would have prevailed again this year, and the Minister may now be using the nurses' strike to balance the health board budget at the end of the year at the expense of patients.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister and the Minister of State, elected for the constituency of Galway West, preside over a health service which is allowing two wards to remain closed at our major hospital, temporary nurses to be laid off, waiting lists to build up, casualty to be overcrowded on a regular basis, and which is putting the health of patients and those on waiting lists at risk? In the Western Health Board area non-emergency surgery beds and day patient beds are not being refilled. The waiting lists in the Western Health Board area show that for ear, nose and throat surgery there are 585 adults and 167 children on the waiting lists, with 55 per cent of the adults waiting more than 12 months and 67 per cent of the children waiting more than six months. For ophthalmology services, there are 917 people on the waiting list, 78 per cent of whom have been waiting for more than 12 months. There are 292 on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery with more than half of them waiting for more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>The nurses' strike is not about wages. There are 201 recommendations in the report of the commission, most of which have not been addressed by the Minister. The key points sought by the nurses in the dispute are, further recognition of staff nurses with broader application and recognition of promotional grades. If the strike proceeds &ndash; and I hope the Minister will see his way to opening meaningful talks &ndash; the Minister cannot blame the strike for lack of cover in hospitals as there is no cover in them even now in advance of the strike. Services have been allowed to run down.</P>

      <P>Okay, I will conclude. On a recent visit to Galway the Taoiseach closed the door on nurses, giving the same &ldquo;No surrender&rdquo; message. I call on the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State to open immediate talks and finally settle the dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This day week a crisis will hit our health services unless the Minister uses these <Col N="92" /> last few remaining days to re-open talks with the nursing unions. A strike by nurses will lengthen our ever increasing public waiting list by 18 months, thereby intensifying the anguish being experienced by individuals awaiting elective surgery. Tonight, and every day, we hear of the increasing numbers on our public waiting lists. However, I want to humanise some of these statistics. Seán is suffering from prostrate cancer. He is awaiting an out-patient appointment so that he can be called for an operation. Sarah has been waiting for the last four years for orthodontic treatment. When she was eventually told she would be taken for treatment she was informed that she would have to wait until this dispute was settled. Michael has a heart condition. He has been told that if he does not have this operation there is a 95 per cent chance that he will be dead within five years. These are the victims of the dispute.</P>
      <P>The nurses have voted overwhelmingly for strike action because they feel they have no other option. The dispute has arisen due to the neglect by numerous Governments of the basic entitlements which many other groups in the public service have as a right. We must recognise that nurses believe they are undervalued, their skills and experience not acknowledged or rewarded. The nursing profession plays a vital role in the community and in our hospitals. We have now reached the ludicrous situation where the health authorities have to advertise nursing posts as far away as Iceland and Finland. Matrons are unable to find nursing staff, with the situation now reaching crisis in many of our hospitals. Unless the profession is made more attractive, Irish nurses working abroad will not return home. Our health services urgently require these people.</P>
      <P>What will happen the elderly man with leg ulcers, with nobody to clean or bandage his wound? He will have to queue for hours to see his GP, or more likely will have to go on a further waiting list, and wait for a number of days to see his GP. Without this treatment the man could be another statistic on our hospital waiting lists. What will happen to the woman taking care of her incontinent mother? Where will she get the nappies and other materials required to keep her mother in a comfortable state for her remaining days? The Minister has talked himself into this current situation. There still remains a window of opportunity and I urge the Minister to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I take the opportunity in the few minutes at my disposal to beg the Minister to intervene in the dispute, because I genuinely believe the forthcoming nurses' strike is a monument to bad planning by him and his Department. Everybody fully realises that the job of a nurse in 1999 is entirely different from what it was in 1979. The demands of the job are also entirely different. It requires much more training, seeks much more responsibility and demands even greater commitment. There was always great commitment in the nursing profession, but <Col N="93" /> that commitment constitutes an even greater calling at present. The new developments in medicine, patient care, drugs and in the interpersonal skills nurses must have in dealing with people who are ill have meant there is an increasing strain on nurses and when they look around at others in comparable employments who seem to be getting on better, is it any wonder they said they had to blow the whistle?</P>
      <P>When the Commission on Nursing examined the entire situation it should have been clear to the Minister and the Government that structural adjustments should have been made and procedures put in place at that time. Had the Minister acted on these issues at that time we would not be here tonight under the pressurised system we have. I know it is particularly difficult to provoke the nursing profession into picketing. As Members are aware, this is their first official strike. The many nurses I know would much prefer to do what they are good at and like best, namely, caring for the aged, the sick and the distressed in our community. Although we are only seven days from action, there is still time for the Minister and the Government to act. It is possible to reach a solution if a bit of compassion and goodwill is shown.</P>
      <P>This impasse between the nurses and the Minister has as much to do with the structural adjustments I spoke about in the nursing profession as it has with pay. If the Minister had shown the sort of compassion and understanding I speak off, and as would be expected from a Minister for Health and Children, we would certainly not find ourselves in this position.</P>
      <P>It must appear unusual to the Minister that during his term of office, with the passing of every month and year, there are fewer nurses available for the various nursing duties around the country. It is very difficult to understand but, it is true. There must be some reason for it and the Minister is the only person in the House who can provide the answer.</P>

      <P>Hospital patients for the first time ever are faced with a nurses' strike. I call on the Minister, the Government and the Health Services Employment Agency to re-open talks with the nursing unions. There is still some time left. I am unhappy with the hard-line attitude of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Government since this problem initially arose. The comments of some members of the Government, including the Minister for Finance's claim that the nurses are &ldquo;claim jumpers&rdquo;, have caused considerable anger in the nursing professions. Comments of that nature only add to the sense of grievance felt by nurses, increase the likelihood of a strike and it certainly led to the increased numbers who finally voted for strike action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently there are 33,400 people on hospital waiting lists. With all elective operations now being postponed, a very difficult situation will be made much worse. It is essential that the Minister <Col N="94" /> for Health and Children, the Health Services Employers Agency and the nursing unions enter discussions before the strike commences, because certainly on the commencement of the strike discussions will have to take place. It is essential discussions take place now, not later when considerable damage and upset to patients has been caused. There has never been a national nurses strike. The nursing profession does not want one. It is essential therefore that every effort is made to avoid this strike. I call on the Government, from whom good will is required, and the Health Service Employers Agency to enter into discussions immediately. Five hundred and sixty-six nursing vacancies remained unfilled. Nurses are leaving the profession. It is obvious therefore that there is a problem and the Minister and the Department should address it rather than adopt a hard line attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>To use the words of another, this truly presents an appalling vista. The Government should make one last ditch effort to deal with the matter. The Government, of which I was proud to be a member, when confronted by the possibility of a nurses strike paid out £85 million on the recommendation of the Labour Court and following the involvement of others, but more importantly established the Commission on Nursing to analyse and consider the structural deficiencies in the nursing profession and to make recommendations on how these could be rectified. The Government has said that it will pay the full amount recommended by the Labour Court, but the key to settlement of this dispute lies in dealing with the structural deficiencies in the nursing profession, including the recognition of expertise and incremental payments in respect of courses followed at one's own cost.</P>
      <P>This House is expected to tear itself asunder on this issue with Members on this side sinking their claws in Members opposite, but this party, through Deputy Shatter's motion, has been very responsible in understanding the sensitivity and seriousness of the matter. If the strike lasts six or ten weeks the House will look back when it is finally settled and ask the question, what was it all about. There is great anger among the nursing and medical profession at the attitude of the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, and there is anger in the community at the fact that there is agreement that a strike should take place. There is also fear among patients.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I was contacted by a woman who had a mastectomy a fortnight ago and is due to start a chemotherapy course this week. I was also contacted by two people with brain tumours who wish to be admitted to Beaumont Hospital but whose admittance has been deferred until after Christmas. People will die if the strike goes ahead and the first case that can be attributed to it will have the most serious consequences for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This weekend the Minister, who has been <Col N="95" /> around a long time, should call all the parties together and deal with the structural deficiencies in the nursing profession on which the nursing commission has made recommendations. Therein lies the solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government adopting a macho image on this issue? If anything, the intemperate statements made last Friday acted as a further flashpoint for nurses. The statement made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in Luxembourg in which he described nurses as claims jumpers could only be described as provocative in dealing with such a sensitive issue on which delicate negotiations are required. The Taoiseach later said in Limerick that he agreed 100 per cent with him. Perhaps the Government is adopting a macho image to show its authority in this matter rather than enter serious negotiations.</P>
      <P>There are 13,000 admissions each week to our hospitals, including 6,000 emergency cases to our acute hospitals. Already there have been 3,000 cancellations. There is anger and concern in the community and my colleagues have stated what is likely to happen if the strike goes ahead. We are not talking about a militant group of people. The 27,000 nurses are only looking for what they believe they rightfully deserve. It is important that the 200 recommendations of the nursing commission are implemented.</P>
      <P>I would have been delighted if the Taoiseach had announced in Limerick last Friday that the good work done by Deputy Noonan with regard to the development of the regional hospital was being continued by opening the 30 bed paediatric ward, the two operating theatres and the radiology and renal dialysis rooms with their specialist equipment, all of which have remained unused for the past year, in a serious effort to reduce the backlog of 1,600 on the waiting list in Limerick for operations. The Minister has been negligent in his duties. I am certain that he would not allow similar units and hospital wards in his constituency to remain unused for over one year.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for placing this important issue on the clár. He has highlighted the record of the Minister on waiting lists and the serious problems that have been encountered as a result. The Minister sat on the problem, in the process putting lives at risk and causing much pain, before there was any suggestion of a nurses strike. Over 90 per cent of nurses have voted to go on strike. They did not take this decision lightly. Wards in hospitals such as the <Col N="96" /> Mater remain closed and services unavailable because nurses are not voting with their feet and returning home in spite of the advertisements and the pressure exerted on them to do so. Their skills and length of service are neither acknowledged nor recognised.</P>
      <P>In the North-Eastern Health Board there are 1,076 more on the waiting list than in June 1997. That is how serious the situation is. One patient was guaranteed in September 1998 that he would have a hip replacement operation in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, before the end of that year. If the Minister allows the strike to go ahead the individual concerned will not be seen before the end of this year. He was to have the operation on 24 October but has now been informed to ring back after the nurses dispute has been settled. If the Minister was to visit that man's home he would recognise that the opportunity is his to sort the matter out and save him pain.</P>
      <P>In the two years from June 1997 to June 1999 the number on the waiting list in Monaghan General Hospital has increased by 60.8 per cent; Cavan, 78 per cent; Our Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, 94.7 per cent; and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, 41.6 per cent. I am quite sure that, because of the problems that have arisen in the past few months, it will be shown even more clearly that the figures will have increased even further before they are resolved.</P>
      <P>District nurses, like all other nurses, are very angry at the Minister's lack of understanding of their needs. They feel there is a serious lack of support for a job that is saving the country an enormous amount of money by making sure that as many people as possible are looked after in their own homes. I have had some personal experience of that recently.</P>
      <P>Some nurses do not even have sufficient bandages with them when they go out to work, and must travel at their own expense to rectify such shortages. As regards the number of nurses available, one must question the entry procedure for the nursing profession. While some trainee nurses have been called for duty in recent times, many young people who passed the nursing examinations and interviews for entry to the profession were subsequently told there were no places for them. The Minister should examine the possibility of recruiting extra nurses.</P>
      <P>The Minister's visit to Monaghan was much appreciated by myself and others, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. A minimum of £5 million was required, yet the Minister gave only £500,000. I appreciate that he has provided a further £500,000 since then, but the balance is still needed and the Minister has sufficient funds to provide it. The dispute will be settled, and the Minister should settle it now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledging that the Government has accepted Labour Court recommendation No. 16261 of 31 August 1999 on nurses' pay and allowance claims;</P>
    <P>&ndash;noting that the Labour Court itself has stated that recommendation No. 16261 is &lsquo;the culmination of many years of discussions and negotiations on nurses' pay and conditions';</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognising that the Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Nursing, which are designed to address the underlying problems within the profession and develop nursing as a key profession within the health services;</P>
    <P>calls on the four nursing unions to call off the threatened all-out nurses strike and to pursue their case in the context of forthcoming discussions between the Government and the social partners on a new national programme to succeed Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to set out in clear and unambiguous terms the position of the Government on nurses' pay and, in particular, to reiterate our determination to protect social partnership.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has delivered major benefits. For this country, it has been a winning formula, and there is no reason to believe that it cannot continue to do so. It has provided the framework within which economic and social goals can be agreed and achieved. The benefits we now enjoy through high levels of employment, low inflation and reduced taxation did not happen by accident. By co-joining the partners in setting overall goals for ourselves, we have empowered people to have a greater say in shaping their own destiny and a greater interest in maintaining the conditions which will make it possible to achieve these goals. Because it is a winner in so many ways, the Government is acting in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the people in seeking to protect social partnership and to deal with challenges which may be posed to its continuation and development.</P>
    <P>The success which social partnership has enabled us to achieve is not confined to the economic sector. In the social area, including health and social services, significantly increased resources have been targeted at areas of need, most of them the subject of prior agreement among the social partners. While there are still and always will be some unmet needs, very considerable progress has been made by successive Governments in addressing the needs of the eld<Col N="98" /> erly and disabled, the handicapped, children and other groups in need of special care and support.</P>
    <P>The overall numbers employed in our health services are now at an all time high, including the number of nurses employed. Social partnership and its fruits have given us the confidence to embark on long-term strategies to tackle the main causes of sickness and death: cancer and cardiovascular disease. There is scarcely an area of the services that is not enjoying a period of development.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has also helped develop the attitudes and structures through which we can plan and implement real change. We have seen that it is possible to bring about planned changes in our society. The nursing profession has, particularly over the past five years, embarked on an agenda for change. The conditions and structures which have evolved out of social partnership have helped the profession to make considerable progress in advancing that agenda and laying the foundations for the further development of nursing. The range and scope of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing could scarcely be contemplated in the days prior to social partnership and it is a certainty that no Government could, at that time, have so readily agreed to fully fund their implementation.</P>
    <P>Outside social partnership, it is difficult to envisage how we could find a formula through which we can, in a controlled way, break out of an iron circle of pay relativities in the public sector and agree a basis on which reward is more closely linked to contribution and performance. Within the social partnership framework, we have found better ways of planning for the future, sharing the fruits of success and settling disputes. Our structures have been designed to settle disputes without causing hardship or inconvenience to the wider community. Most people, including Members of this House, would agree that invoking the strike weapon within a social partnership context represents an attack on an edifice which has been painstakingly constructed by people from all sectors of society. It is within that edifice, rather than outside it, that each group can best advance its agenda, provided that others accept the justification for their advancement. It is against this background, therefore, that the Government must stand firm in this dispute, which is not of its making.</P>
    <P>The history of nurses' pay talks is a long one, punctuated by a series of offers followed by rejection. In order to provide a context for the situation now confronting us, it is necessary to go back to 1994. Discussions with the Nursing Alliance under the PCW restructuring clause commenced in late 1994, when management offered nurses a down payment of 1 per cent, effective from 1 April of that year, the same as had been offered to other public sector groups. This was accepted by the nursing unions who then broke off talks <Col N="99" /> to consider progress. Talks resumed in February 1996, during which management tabled a conditional offer of £20 million. This offer was rejected following a ballot by nurses. In March 1996, following intervention by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, talks took place at the Labour Relations Commission, which resulted in agreement on a set of proposals costing £33.5 million. This enhanced offer was rejected by the Nursing Alliance following a ballot.</P>
    <P>Direct discussions between management and the nursing unions were resumed in June 1996. The nurses' pay issue was subsequently referred to an independent arbitration board established by the Government and the Congress of Trade Unions to hear outstanding pay disputes. This adjudication board recommended a package worth some £50 million to nurses. This package was accepted by SIPTU and the PNA, but rejected by the INO and IMPACT. Strike notice was then served to expire on 10 February 1997. The Labour Court then intervened and on 7 February 1997 issued a recommendation containing a package costing £85 million. This was accepted by nurses on the basis that a commission on nursing would be established to examine and report on the role of nurses in the health services.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court finding of February 1997 provided for special pay increases of up to 17 per cent for the grades of staff nurse and ward sister, with similar level increases for other grades. These increases were substantially in excess of the 5.5 per cent cap on restructuring deals under the PCW agreed by the then rainbow coalition Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Labour Court justified the award of such large pay increases to nurses on the basis that their pay scales, to quote directly from the court's recommendation: &ldquo;have fallen significantly behind other groups&rdquo;. This statement clearly demonstrates that the Labour Court regarded nurses as a special case deserving a special pay award.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight one particular aspect of the court's finding relating to long-service increments at that time. The adjudication board had recommended a salary scale for staff nurses with two long-service increments. The Labour Court subsumed those two increments into a new ten-point salary scale for staff nurses and added a new long-service increment to the new scale. I am left wondering to what extent staff nurses were made aware that long-service increments had been conceded to them at that stage.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing was established in March 1997. Its membership included representatives of the four nursing unions. Seven of the 14 ordinary members of the commission were drawn from the nursing profession. The commission's final report, entitled A Blueprint for the Future, was formally presented to me in September 1998. <Col N="100" /> At the launch of the report, I announced, on behalf of the Government, that it had accepted the broad thrust of the report and that it was committed to implementing its recommendations. That remains our position.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing made some 200 recommendations for tackling the underlying problems within the profession and developing nursing as a key profession within the health services. While only three of its recommendations related to pay, these have overshadowed everything else since the report was published.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of misrepresentation about what the commission recommended on the three pay-related issues. In order to set the record straight as to what it recommended, I want to quote verbatim from the relevant sections of the report. Paragraph 6.64 of the report states: &ldquo;The Commission recommends that the question of additional recognition of long service for staff nurses be examined through the established structures.&rdquo;  Paragraph 6.66 states: &ldquo;The Commission recommends that outstanding claims for allowances should be referred to the Labour Court for argument and determination as a matter of urgency.&rdquo;  Paragraph 7.50 states:</P>
    <P>The Commission recommends that differentials and incremental annual leave in promotional grades be examined as a matter of urgency, before the end of December 1998, through the established structures. To this examination should be added the effect of the enhanced role for ward sisters and higher grades which has been recommended by the Commission earlier in this chapter.</P>
    <P>The fundamental fact that needs to be emphasised here is that the Commission on Nursing did not recommend that staff nurses should be given additional long service increments.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Commission on Nursing report, there were three residual pay-related issues to be addressed. These were referred to the Labour Court for determination. On 9 February 1999, the Labour Court issued two recommendations covering all three pay issues. The court awarded significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas and who hold special qualifications &ndash; allowances were to be increased from £333 to £1,000 where nurses work in a specialist area, and to £1,500 where they have a specialist qualification. Thousands of staff nurses and a significant number of ward sisters stand to benefit from this increase. This finding was accepted by the Government on 10 February 1999.</P>
    <P>Part of the claim lodged with the Labour Court by the Nursing Alliance was for three additional long service increments &ndash; each of 6 per cent &ndash; for staff nurses. This claim was rejected by the Labour Court on the grounds that, to quote directly from the court's recommendation, &ldquo;The <Col N="101" /> pay scales for staff nurses were addressed in Labour Court Recommendation No. 15450.&rdquo;  That was the February 1997 award, which gave staff nurses a special increase of up to 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the third pay-related issue, that of differentials, the Labour Court, while accepting that there were grounds for salary increases in promotion grades, believed that these must be based on negotiation and implementation of the Commission on Nursing report, which had not yet been discussed by the parties. Accordingly, the court established a negotiating process to address the implementation of the commission's report. While some progress was made in direct discussions between the management and union sides, there was no agreement on pay and the matter was referred back to the court.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court issued its final determination on the nurses' pay issue on 31 August last. The court's package included an average increase of about 10 per cent for ward sisters and higher grades; a lump sum payment of £1,250 for every nurse employed in the public health services, conditional on acceptance of the Labour Court recommendation; additional annual leave for all nurses linked to service, up to three days for staff nurses and up to four days for ward sisters and higher grades; a personal allowance payable on a red circle basis to serving nurses in certain grades to compensate for the apparent loss of existing differentials under the proposed pay structures; and an interim award of 4 per cent to nurse tutors pending the report of the Nursing Education Forum.</P>
    <P>In its summary, the Labour Court states that its recommendation &ldquo;is the culmination of many years of discussions and negotiations on nurses' pay and conditions.&rdquo;  The court goes on to say that it &ldquo;believes that the package now proposed, in addition to the concessions already received on pay, conditions and allowances, represents significant improvements in the financial package for nurses.&rdquo;  It also points out that the &ldquo;issue of nurses' pay and conditions has taken up more of the court's time in recent years than any other issue.&rdquo;  It is vital to highlight these salient comments made by the Labour Court in order to counteract the suggestions made in some quarters that the court did not understand fully the issues involved and that its finding was less than favourable to nurses.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the value of the final package produced by the court is more than three times what the HSEA tabled in direct discussions with the Nursing Alliance. Moreover, the Labour Court did not exclude staff nurses from its final determination, notwithstanding its earlier ruling that their pay scales had been addressed in February 1997. The lump sum payment and the additional annual leave, taken in conjunction with the significant increase in allowances awarded by <Col N="102" /> the court earlier this year, ensures that staff nurses stand to gain as well as other nursing grades.</P>
    <P>Within 24 hours of the Labour Court issuing its finding, I brought the finding before the Government which accepted it on the basis that it brought to an end a protracted negotiating process on nurses' pay going back to 1994. Within days, three of the four nursing unions had decided to recommend rejection of the finding to their members. Having insisted on the three residual pay-related issues going before the Labour Court and having had those issues fully considered by the court, it seems the union leadership then had a change of heart. Not only were they recommending rejection of the Labour Court finding, but the Irish Nurses Organsiation then started looking for parity with paramedic grades in the health services, while the Psychiatric Nurses Association have been talking about parity with teachers. Neither of these aspirations, however, formed the basis of their claim before the Labour Court. At the February 1997 Labour Court hearings, the Nursing Alliance sought to link the pay of staff nurses with that of the Grade Vs in the health services, which is a supervisory-administrative function. Moving the goal posts like this is a totally unacceptable way of conducting industrial relations business. They want to negotiate, in effect, another new claim, having rejected the arbitration finding in respect of the claim they argued for four years on a totally different basis.</P>
    <P>I have been portrayed as having being opposed to negotiations. The issue of nurses' pay has been four years in the negotiating process. I have spent more time on industrial relations issues relating to nursing since I became Minister than on any other industrial relations matter.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the nurses' pay issue and the threat of an all-out strike is correct and responsible. It is consistent with the position taken by the rainbow coalition Government in 1996. It is a pity, however, that some of the Opposition Deputies seem to be suffering from selective amnesia. Deputy Noonan, in replying to an Adjournment Debate on nurses' pay in this House on 26 November 1996 when he was Minister for Health, made the following statement:</P>
    <P>I would obviously be deeply concerned at the impact of strike action on the health service and on patients in its care. It is also clear that an industrial action of the type now apparently being contemplated by the NIO could have serious ramifications for the prospects of any new pay agreement based on social partnership. For these reasons, I would again appeal to the leadership of the Irish Nurses Organisation, and the other nursing unions, with the assistance of ICTU, to reconsider their strategy and to adopt an approach in keeping with the partnership model of industrial relations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn's own views on the management of public service pay were published in a report of an interview with him which appeared in the 5 February 1998 edition of <i>Industrial Relations News</i>. He is quoted as saying that as Minister for Finance &ldquo;he looked at the economy both as the ringmaster and the paymaster&rdquo; and that it took him &ldquo;about 15 months to realise that there was no one managing the public sector side of the equation.&rdquo;  I want to inform Deputy Quinn that we did not take 15 months to figures that one out.

      <P>Deputy Quinn also talked of the management negotiating teams not being sure of the political mandate they had. He also spoke of weak management enfeebled because when they did take a stand, they did not get the back up. I assure Deputy Quinn that the teams that negotiate on my behalf know exactly what political mandate they have. In dealing with this dispute, health service managers are very much aware of their responsibilities and have not been afraid to hold a position in the interests of the public at large in areas like the provision of emergency nursing cover to ensure that patients' lives are not put at risk.</P>

      <P>The record shows that when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, he was not anxious to move beyond the £50 million package that was on offer to nurses in late 1996 and early 1997.</P>
      <P>In a radio interview on 12 November 1996, Deputy Quinn said:</P>
      <P>As far as the Government as management are concerned, we have exhausted all of the room for manoeuvre that existed for us as one of the signatories to the PCW and I would not like any impression to be given that one extra push or shove might result in additional monies being put on the table. That would be an error of judgment if people were to think that such an additional movement or push would bring about extra money.</P>
      <P>When the £85 million package was finally agreed in February 1997, Deputy Quinn levied public services to pay for the nurses' pay increase.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to compare his stance then with his recent statements which called on the Government to give nurses what they are looking for and worry about relativities later. This opportunistic and simplistic approach to an issue which has far wider implications than Deputy Quinn now appears to admit is in marked contrast to the more measured response of his party colleague, Deputy Rabbitte. He was prepared to admit in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week that this dispute cannot be solved in isolation from the pay determination system that governs it, with all the attendant relativities that implies. What some members of the opposition need to realise is that when it comes to defending the wider common good, the same fundamental considerations continue to apply regardless of where they sit in this House.</P>

      <P>This is on top of the £85 million award of February 1997. The combined value of all these improvements on an ongoing basis is more than £150 million and equates to an average increase of approximately 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is in stark contrast with the restructuring increases to other groups of workers which were limited to 5.5 per cent under PCW. The restraint shown by the rest of the trades union movement in accepting this difference in recognition of the exceptional position of nurses is not likely to extend to any increase above and beyond the recent Labour Court finding. Everybody needs to understand that under the present arrangements it is not possible to disregard existing relativities. Nurses' pay cannot be dealt with in isolation from other public service groups. As the Taoiseach recently pointed out, it is implausible in the present context to suppose that developments in any part of the public service can be viewed in isolation and will not have a domino effect on other groups, sectors or on society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Given the enormous amount of time and effort devoted by the Labour Court to finding a solution to the issue of nurses' pay, it is a matter of deep regret, as a former Minister for Labour, that three of the four nursing unions saw fit to recommend rejection of the court's package so soon after it was issued. This demonstrates a lack of respect for or a lack of understanding of the key role of the Labour Court in relation to the resolution of industrial relations issues under social partnership.</P>

      <P>The HSEA entered the process last autumn on what it believed at the time would be the same basis as the Nursing Alliance. That was that both sides would argue their respective positions and that the Labour Court would decide on the merits or otherwise of the claims before it, having considered those arguments. It was perfectly reasonable for the HSEA to assume this, based on comments made by Mr. Liam Doran, chairman of the Nursing Alliance, when interviewed on the &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; radio programme on 21 September 1998. He said and I quote from the transcript of that programme:</P>
      <P>We are following exactly what was laid down by the Commission of Nursing, exactly what's contained in the Commission of Nursing Recommendations . all the recommendations stated was that these matters should be referred to the system as it were, that's how we do our business week in, week out, we don't see why there should be any difference in relation to the three recommendations . ... that's all we are seeking, due process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Doran has been critical of me recently for continually quoting the Labour Court recommendation. However, he appears to have forgotten that at the time of the launch of the report of the Commission on Nursing he insisted that the <Col N="106" /> three pay-related recommendations be referred to the Labour Court for independent arbitration. Mr. Doran wanted the three residual issues, the three key recommendations on pay, &ldquo;referred to the system&rdquo;. That was what he sought. On 31 August last this process gave three times the increase management had offered. Having got such a good result, the union leadership almost immediately rejected it.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted the Labour Court's findings and has honoured everything it has been asked to do by way of independent arbitration. We have no option but to stand firm on the outcome of the Labour Court proceedings. As the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;to do otherwise, would be to act against the interests of the community, interests that will be irrevocably damaged by the inevitable knock-on effects of paying more than recommended by the Labour Court&rdquo;. I reiterate that the Government is committed to paying the full terms of the Labour Court finding and, as far as the Government is concerned, that offer remains on the table. However, there is no possibility of improving upon the terms of the Labour Court finding.</P>
    <P>An all-out nurses' strike would be a clear breach of the industrial peace clause in Partnership 2000 and previous programmes. The absolutist and uncompromising stance being adopted by the leadership of the Nursing Alliance threatens the foundations of the real and substantial progress we have made, as a society and an economy, over the past 12 years through the development of our social partnership. Social partnership and its practical application of wage moderation in return for tax improvements has been a key feature of this amazing transformation in our economy and the wider social benefits. The Taoiseach and the Government are extremely concerned that this vital partnership is now under threat from the actions of groups in the public service and most immediately from the nursing unions. Nobody should doubt, however, the resolve of this Government to protect social partnership.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, there is a better approach to public sector pay. The almost mathematical method of applying relativities and analogues is not appropriate in today's changing world. The Taoiseach has outlined a credible alternative to confrontation in this case and a way forward that will provide a better outcome for us all. That alternative is renewal of our commitment at national level to social partnership and a series of practical steps to a new partnership agreement. That national position must be combined with an approach to public sector pay which is imaginative in ensuring that the income of public servants should more closely reflect their performance and not be based on so-called traditional relativities. This is the context within which the aims and aspirations of public servants, including nurses, can best be met.</P>
    <P>Discussions are under way at present with representatives of the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about <Col N="107" /> developing a new approach to public service pay determination. The intention is that the outcome of these discussions could be reflected in any new national programme which might be negotiated as a successor to Partnership 2000. A considerable amount of preparatory work in connection with discussions on a new programme has already been undertaken by the social partners and a special ICTU conference seeking a mandate to enter talks on a successor to Partnership 2000 is scheduled for 4 November. The nursing unions are represented at the discussions with the public service unions and it would make more sense for them to work with their colleagues and the Government on developing an agreed framework on public service pay within which the reasonable aims and aspirations of all public servants, including nurses, could be met in a way which respects the needs of our ultimate paymasters, the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, appeal to the Nursing Alliance to call off the threatened all-out strike and to pursue its case in the context of the forthcoming discussions between the Government and the social partners on a new national programme to succeed Partnership 2000. A strike is a blunt weapon which has no place in a modern industrial relations process. The Government does not believe it will advance the aspirations of nurses. On the contrary, it will inflict hardship on patients and other clients of the health services who are in need of nursing care.</P>
    <P>Nurses represent the largest single group of health care professionals. They are, therefore, a powerful group, but this power must be used constructively. Resorting to all-out strike, even if conducted in the most benign way possible, will disrupt the continuity of care to many vulnerable members of society, including some of the elderly or those suffering from a mental handicap or a mental illness, and is not a constructive use of power. Such a course of action, which is totally unnecessary, would lead nurses down a cul-de-sac. I am alarmed by some of the statements emanating from the leadership of the Nursing Alliance. Phrases such as &ldquo;war on the streets&rdquo; and &ldquo;upping the ante&rdquo; have a consequence of imposing hardships on patients. This is not what nurses want to do. The Government believes that the interests of nurses would be better served by their union leaders using their influence positively to shape the new partnership agreement in a way that ensures a new approach to public service pay determination, as proposed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court said in February 1997 that a nurses' strike could damage, perhaps irreparably, relations between claimants and their employers and inflict unnecessary hardship on the community. The strike weapon has no place in social partnership. The alternative route which the Government has proposed will not involve the public. There is no need to disadvantage the public. The public is entitled to ask why are they <Col N="108" /> being involved by the nursing unions in a strike campaign where there is an alternative route available to the unions that does not involve the public.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that progress in implementing further recommendations of the report of the Commission on Nursing is being held up by the failure to reach agreement on the deal brokered by the Labour Court. While I fervently hope that the threatened strike does not go ahead, I would be failing in my statutory responsibilities if I did not initiate contingency planning arrangements for the provision of emergency and essential cover in the event of an all-out nurses strike. I am concerned at the continuing failure to agree a national framework for the development of emergency cover for the duration of the strike. There is a meeting tomorrow and I urge the leadership of the Nursing Alliance to agree its approach despite the important issue so we can all agree at national level, given that everybody claims that the objective is not to put patients at risk during the course of any strike.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus today referred to GPs and family doctors not yet being informed about emergency cover arrangements. In the absence of nursing union agreement to a national framework, health agencies are not in a position to be definitive as to the likely cover that will be available. The Department wrote to the IMO last week to appraise it of the situation and will be meeting the IMO on Thursday, the day after it meets the Nursing Alliance, for further discussions on a national emergency plan.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the health service is hugely important to the community and to each individual. We have all benefited from the service at some stage in our lives. It is an unfortunate fact of life that good things are seldom said about what is, by any standards, a good service. The national development plan will be further testament to the importance the Government attaches to building up our health services and improving equity of access to these public services. Nurses do not have to go on strike to have their rightful place in the management of the health service. I want to see nurses and other health care professionals have a real involvement in the running of their own institutions. I want to get rid of hierarchies. I want to give nurses more power in decision making in their own wards and units. All this is possible without recourse to the strike weapon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, when the four nursing unions gave notice of strike action commencing next Tuesday, I appealed to them to call off their action and to see that there is a better way. What is about to befall our health service in less than a week's time is extremely serious. Much has been said about the threat to patient care and even lives. Very <Col N="109" /> little has been said, however, about the effect the strike will have on the profession of nursing.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech was disappointing. It was comprehensive as regards history and, as usual, criticism of the Opposition but sadly lacking in any new thinking or possibilities of a resolution. It underlined the urgency of dialogue between the Minister and the unions to establish if it is possible to prevent a strike. It is clear from the Minister's speech that we are facing a strike and an unprecedented situation in our health services which is a direct result of the attitude being taken by the Minister for Health and Children. Nothing that has been said tonight negates that in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this debate and I wish to put it into context. Irish health care has a distinguished history of which we can be proud. Our health professionals, including nurses, have a track record second to none. Many of them worked in other countries and built up a reputation of excellence. They are valued abroad and rightly so. Because they have not been valued enough at home a nightmare scenario is unfolding which, unless averted by political leadership &ndash; there is no other way &ndash; will cause irreparable harm. It is clear that the role played by nurses in the delivery of medical services, coupled with the expanded range of skills they have acquired in recent years, points to the need for a fundamental reappraisal of their position in the health services pay hierarchy. However, this dispute is not just about money. Anybody who has taken the time to listen <Col N="110" /> to what nurses have to say is aware there are a number of elements in this dispute.</P>
    <P>The need has not been met and for the first time we are facing an all-out strike by nurses. If, as is likely, it goes ahead, this strike will have an unprecedented impact on our health services. If it is a long strike &ndash; all the indicators are that this is what the Government intends &ndash; it will do incalculable long-term damage to the fabric of health care. The tragedy is that if we had a good and creative Government we would not be contemplating such a prospect. Even if we had a competent one, it would mean we would not be here seeking an eleventh hour reprieve from a Government that seems incapable of understanding what is required of it. Perhaps I should spell it out.</P>
    <P>What we do not need is intimidation, neither do we need abuse, aggression or arrogance. We do not need escalating bad relations between nurses' representatives and Government representatives. Yet, so far that is the main message which has come from this Government. Instead of dealing with the problem over the past week and longer, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, have retired to the bunker. Their response to the deepening crisis is to keep out of sight while lobbing verbal grenades at nursing professionals. Today's veiled rebuke by the Taoiseach of both Ministers, made in temperate language, was too late to undo that damage, although it is noteworthy in itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We got no such rebuke, the record will show that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning the Minister for Health tried a different tactic, he pleaded with the nurses, rather like the battering husband who deludes himself into thinking that all will be forgiven if he cajoles his wife. The Minister is not unintelligent, he must know neither ploy has the slightest chance of success and is no substitute for equal and open dialogue. Has he not realised the enormity of what is ahead? Is he incapable of coping with it or is it that deep down, he does not care enough? We are all aware the Minister is in the wrong Department, but surely this is more serious than one's predilection for a particular Department. We are all aware of the complexities. Nobody underestimates the difficulties and we know it is not a new problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, nursing has been a largely female profession. Like thousands of other women who contributed their labour to building up the State and who helped to make it the success story it is, nurses were poorly recompensed and poorly recognised. For generations, they were unable to find the voice and the means to carve out their rightful place in society. What is different is that they have done so now, all 27,500 of them, some of them men, most of them women. Talking down to women may have worked for Fianna Fáil politicians in the past but no longer. It is time the <Col N="111" /> Government got this clear, unequivocal message &ndash; women will not be patronised again.</P>
    <P>In 1997, when Roy Porter's<i> History of World Medicine</i> was published there was only one significant contribution accredited to Ireland, the creation of the nursing profession. The founders of the great orders, Catherine McAuley and Mother Mary Aikenhead appear in this book as the giants of Irish medical history. That tradition of professionalism has held true despite the lack of official recognition of its worth. However, what was once sustained by a sense of vocation needs sustenance of a different sort now. Political recognition must be given to the fact that the world has changed, nursing has changed and that has meant, at times, unbearable stress for those who helped to save lives and alleviate suffering.</P>
    <P>A recent study carried out by the Department of Nursing Studies in UCC showed nursing is still attracting highly motivated students, the majority of whom would be eligible for arts degree courses at university level. There is also a high level of job satisfaction. That is the good news. The bad news is that the vast majority complain of poor working conditions, bad pay and a lack of promotional opportunities. We are fortunate that nursing can still attract people of such calibre. However, it is clear that without new thinking and incentives, the central role of nursing is in jeopardy. The Minister holds the key to a resolution of these issues. He bears the responsibility. That is what Governments are for &ndash; they must solve problems and find political solutions that will enable society to function fairly and efficiently. This Government won the last general election on the basis that it would meet serious health challenges. It promised to tackle waiting lists but it has failed to do so. Waiting lists, despite the money thrown at them, are still higher by 4,000 or 5,000 than when the Government took office.</P>
    <P>Now we face a health care crisis that is almost inconceivable in its extent and, so far, the Government is proving itself grossly deficient in the task of preventing it. The Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children has been quoted in the newspapers as saying that the strike may well extend to three weeks. If it does, it will result in more than 3,000 new patients being added to the waiting lists per week. One hundred thousand appointments every week will be cancelled. It is happening already. Necessary surgical procedures for cancer patients have been cancelled. In County Wicklow, I am aware of cancer patients who have already been informed that they cannot now have the operations they need. This is the cause of great anguish to them and their families. As a result of the action of Labour Party members, an emergency meeting of the Eastern Health Board is being held to try to cope with the cancellations of services.</P>
    <P>This prospect has the hallmarks of a catastrophe, both for individual patients and for the health services in general. If industrial action <Col N="112" /> takes place and lasts three weeks, it has been calculated that it will take more than a year to get back to the point at which we are now, which is already a breaking point that is characterised by waiting lists of approximately 35,000 patients and hospital wards closing due to staff shortages. In 1998, the Mater Hospital carried out only 873 of its target 1,000 open heart operations due to a lack of nurses. On one day recently, 38 patients were treated on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital because of overcrowding. The staff at Loughlinstown Hospital is down by 25 nurses and in other hospitals it is down by considerably more. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association has estimated the actual need of nursing spaces at about 3,000. That is the current state of the health services. On top of that, we are approaching the time of year when accident and emergency units will be under particular pressure due to seasonal demand.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the lack of preparation for this strike and I do not accept what the Minister said in that regard. The national emergency plan has not yet been drawn up which is, in itself, symptomatic of a lack of drive. Most importantly, family doctors and general practitioners have not been included or informed about anything to do with the strike even though they will feel the load and will have to carry the burdens that will arise as a result. Basic information, even at this late stage, would be extremely useful for such doctors.</P>
    <P>Saving lives and alleviating suffering is the work of our health services. However, that work is being severely undermined by a lack of strategic planning and strong investment. It is extraordinary that this is the legacy of a Government which presides over the richest Exchequer returns in the history of the State. The kitty is overflowing with money yet the sick and disabled and those who care for them are denied proper support and resources, even though they know that politics holds the key to their requirements and that political decisions can make all the difference to their lives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody, whether sick or healthy, is conscious of what is possible. A desire to save lives and to alleviate suffering in Northern Ireland led to extraordinary political effort and, at times, superhuman political courage by Governments. That continues to this day. Politicians went the extra mile and the result was a milestone, the Good Friday Agreement. The evidence is there to remind us that Governments can resolve even the most intractable difficulties and that initiative, imagination and, most importantly, political will can lead to a breakthrough of historic importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it that the same spirit of political achievement cannot be applied now to save lives and to alleviate suffering? I do not know of any nurse who would prefer to be on a picket line than doing his or her job. However, neither do <Col N="113" /> I know of any nurse who is intimidated by the threatening talk and the unscrupulous use of language by the Minister for Finance. In their line of duty, nurses can experience violent attacks, bullying behaviour and the sheer unpleasantness of tending to basic human functions. They are trained to have stamina as well as sympathy and they will not be cowed into submission.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later a deal will have to be struck with the nurses. The only question is whether it will be now, before the strike takes place, or after a long drawn out, damaging and painful strike. That choice is being made by the Government. To say there is no alternative is simply wrong. In politics there is always an alternative. The Labour Court has a fine record but when a recommendation is rejected by a nine to one margin, it is evident that an initiative must be taken.</P>
    <P>There is much to be won by a Government initiative. Resolving this dispute would bring hope to a health service that has serious problems which need to be addressed. A resolution that prevents a strike by nurses would do great good and would be the strongest signal possible to those who avail of our health services and those who work in them that the Government, at a time of plenty, is seriously committed and dedicated to real health reform. It is not too late. It is possible to draw back from the brink. The Government has the money, resources and expertise to do the business for which it was elected. I call on the Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to get down to doing that business.</P>

      <P>We are on the brink of one of the most serious industrial relations disputes in the history of the State. The health care services will be plunged into crisis in a week from today and some of the most dedicated and committed professionals in the country will be forced on to the picket line in their ongoing campaign to achieve a fair wage and fair play from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seriousness of this crisis cannot be understated. A Sunday newspaper reported that a senior official in the Department of Health and Children spoke recently of his belief that the strike would last for up to three weeks. In the three weeks, the senior official estimated that up to 50 lives would be lost. Fifty lives are at risk. In any other situation where this serious risk to human life existed, a responsible Government would do all in its power to avert it. However, this Government will not even enter into dialogue with the nurses. Instead, senior members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children, have lectured the nursing profession and used the past ten days to begin their public relations assault on that profession. It is a grossly irresponsible and highly insulting way to address the crisis and it only strengthens the resolve of <Col N="114" /> the nurses to resist the arm twisting tactics being used against them.</P>
    <P>The motion calls on the Government to reverse its damaging and insensitive policy. It calls on the Government to do all in its power to avert the crisis in these last important days and to enter into dialogue with the nurses. The call has been echoed by senior church figures and leading trade unionists but it has fallen on deaf ears. The effect of the Government's approach to this dispute is already causing widespread hardship. In recent days elective procedures, for which people have waited for months and years, have already been cancelled.</P>
    <P>Many speakers in this debate have referred to the changing nature of the nursing profession. I support the professional and determined manner in which the nursing unions have pursued their claim. For too long they have been treated like socially concerned volunteers who are paid a stipend to make ends meet. I am delighted the nurses are determined to rid officialdom of this image and attitude. Nurses are skilled professionals who deserve to be treated as such by their employers and are entitled to use their collective strength to pursue fair play and a fair wage. I urge the Government to recognise this and to engage immediately in dialogue with the nursing unions.</P>
    <P>The impending withdrawal of services by the nurses constitutes our greatest crisis ever in health care and hospital services. Irish nurses have a proud record in the health care system. Due to the lack of proper recognition for their skills over the years, many thousands of qualified Irish nurses have found employment in Britain, the USA and throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered that from the day each public sector worker entered employment, income tax and other taxes were deduced from their wages at source with no opportunity for tax evasion that was rife among elements of the Irish business elite. The onus is on the Government to find a solution to the nurses' claim and avoid the frightening consequences of patients being left without nursing care. The impact of a nurses' strike on the health services is unimaginable. The Government knows that it will have to strike a bargain at some stage. It should do so now before plunging the nursing profession and those who depend on public health care into a strike which will be a nightmare for all involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children is ultimately responsible for the care of every patient in this country and there is an onus on him to find a resolution to this dispute. If he fails to do so it <Col N="115" /> will represent a most serious dereliction of duty by a Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Coveney. Last Wednesday the workers in Sealand, the freight distribution centre in Cork, were told their jobs were to finish in January. This came as a great shock and surprise to them because Sealand, which had set up within the past four months, had been taken over by a Danish company, Maersk. We are told the reason for the proposed closure is that the company preferred to maintain its distribution centre in its own country. The workers had recently taken up employment with Sealand and many of them had left good jobs to do so. These are people, not statistics. There are 160 people involved many with mortgages and other commitments. They did not expect this to happen. I understand from speaking to the IDA that it will go to Denmark to try to get the company to reverse its decision and see if it is possible for it to stay in Cork. This is what the IDA hoped for. I would like the Minister and the Tanáiste to take an active role in trying to persuade Maersk to stay in Cork. It is not good enough to say to these people that they are victims of an international business deal.</P>
      <P>Three weeks ago the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business visited this site and were told that it was a jewel in the crown of Cork Airport Business Park and that it was to extend its facility there. Suddenly, out of the blue, three weeks later there is a proposed closure. Will the Minister give a commitment that the Tanáiste will become involved with the IDA in discussions to try to reverse this decision. It can be done if a Government approach is taken. I would like a commitment from the Minister on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday evening, 160 people in Cork were asked to accept that they would lose their jobs in the new year, only three <Col N="116" /> months after being employed. Three months ago Sealand shipping group officially opened a centralised management centre in the new Cork Airport Business Park. The location seemed ideal, the skilled workforce suitable. The company was expected to employ up to 300 people in the next three years. We are told the reason for the closure is a takeover by a Danish company, to which Deputy Clune referred, that does not seem to have a policy of centralised management within Europe.</P>
      <P>There are questions I would like answered. For how long has the IDA been aware of the takeover of Sealand by Maersk? Did the IDA meet Maersk management at the earliest opportunity to find out its future plans for the Cork offices? If not, why not? Has the IDA met Maersk management since the announcement? Has it had any success in reversing this decision? If the Sealand jobs are gone, and being realistic they probably are, what is perhaps most worrying is that these jobs were ideally suited for Cork and Ireland, requiring the technology, skilled workforce and quality of infrastructure that makes Cork so competitive as an investment location for employers. In short, these are the types of jobs that we should attract because they are secure and sustainable.</P>
      <P>Is the Tanáiste taking an active role in trying to replace these 300 jobs? May Deputy Clune and I take home some good news to the 160 workers who may face unemployment in January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. My colleague, Deputy Flynn, raised the matter last week. I share fully the Deputies' concern and disappointment over the announcement that Sealand has decided to close its operation at Cork. I am conscious of the effect this will have on Cork and, most immediately, on the employees concerned. I hope I can answer the questions raised by Deputy Coveney, at least in a broader sense, to try to give him the sequence of events.</P>
      <P>In June, 1998 the Government approved grant aid to the company which would have resulted in the eventual creation of up to 300 jobs within three years, with additional jobs later. Securing this project for Cork was a significant achievement by IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>At that time, Sealand Service Inc., based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was the largest US flag container ship operator and one of the three top international container shipping companies in the world. Its fleet of 99 ships serves 120 ports in 80 countries, employing 9,105 people. Sealand was wholly owned by CSX Corporation, a US public company in transportation employing 46,900 staff, with sales of $10.62 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to its decision to locate this facility in Cork, the company operated its customer service <Col N="117" /> and documentation handling at local office level in 13 European countries. Sealand decided to rationalise its administrative and customer service functions and centralise them in a new shared services centre in Cork. This new operation was intended to have responsibility for customer service, finance, procurement, claims documentation and information technology and could have led to the future establishment of a new tele-sales function. At full operation the centre would have involved the use of a total of 12 different languages.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, Sealand has had an operating alliance with Maersk Lines, the Danish carrier, as Deputy Clune pointed out, sharing vessels and equipment and enabling it to provide a global network with greater scope and operating frequency at reduced costs.</P>
    <P>The company commenced operation in the Cork Airport Business Park and currently employs a total of 168 staff. However, Sealand was taken over by its alliance partner, Maersk, in August last. That company operates on the basis of local offices in each country rather than on the basis of a centralised shared services operation which was favoured by Sealand. In addition, different computer systems are used by the two companies and the Maersk system will now be adopted. Accordingly, the new owners have decided to close the Cork operation with effect from January next.</P>
    <P>The IDA is meeting the new owners in an effort to retain some business activity in Cork and I hope there will be a positive outcome to these discussions. I would emphasise that the closure does not reflect on the workforce nor on the contribution they were making to the company. It is an unfortunate result of a different business strategy being adopted by the new owners.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this serious blow, there has been a significant upturn in the employment position in Cork in recent times. The Government has been able to announce very significant new employment projects in recent years and especially this year. In May last, the Tanáiste announced that the American Bankers Insurance Group was setting up a data processing and claims operation in the city which will provide 300 jobs. In July last she announced a 350 job project at SMT which is engaged in electronic contract manufacturing; 100 software jobs in the Pilz company and 50 new software jobs in Datastream Systems Inc. In the same month she opened the Stryker premises in Carrigtwohill. That company will generate a total of 290 new jobs there. Last month, the Tanáiste also announced a 250 job software project at CMG Telecommunications. Other investment projects which were secured this year include Infor Business Solutions, IMTF, Nycomed and Siemens. These latter projects will generate a total of 375 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>The Tanáiste has asked FÁS to ensure that <Col N="118" /> everything possible will be done to enhance the employees' prospects for re-employment. Given the continued improvement of the economy as a whole, the promising trends in Cork in particular and the ongoing efforts of the State agencies, I hope the Sealand workers will be able to obtain alternative employment with the minimum of disruption.</P>

      <P>The annual report of the Health and Safety Authority, which was published last week, informed us that 70 people died in 1998 as a result of accidents at work and 6,512 workplace accidents occurred. In the words of the chairman of the authority, these figures are totally unacceptable. While 26 deaths occurred in the agricultural sector, 22 people died last year on building sites. The report of the authority is well presented but there is a litany of neglect. I do not intend to go into that in detail &ndash; the Minister has the report and he knows what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>One death at work is a death too many. Each accident that occurs in the workplace is an accident that should have been prevented. The heartbreak, pain and suffering that occurs after each accident affects hundreds of families and can last for years. Indeed, the pain and suffering as a result of a death of a loved one at work may never end for those left behind. The cold statistics in this report do not tell the full story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn to the situation in the construction sector. There were 22 deaths in 1998, 12 so far this year, and 92 since 1994. I acknowledge that both the trade unions and the Construction Industry Federation are very concerned and many companies have committed considerable resources to raise awareness and improve safety on building sites. Where companies take safety seriously we find accidents are either very few or eliminated altogether. Employees and employers must take safety seriously. Many do but where carelessness and dangerous practices exist and lives are put at risk, it is the duty of the State, as represented by the Health and Safety Authority, to intervene and take whatever action is necessary to prevent accidents and deaths. In order to intervene effectively, the Health and Safety Authority must be provided with the resources to do its job properly. I understand it has approximately 65 inspectors to monitor every industry in the State. The Minister might correct me, but it is my understanding that only seven of these inspectors are engaged in the construction industry. When asked on the radio recently the number of inspectors working in the construction industry the Minister said that there are 135 in total work<Col N="119" /> ing in the HSA, he did not answer the question properly. Perhaps he will tell us tonight the number of inspectors who are engaged in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The 1998 figures indicate that there are 138,000 workers in the industry. It is the job of the Minister to ensure that the HSA has the resources to do its work properly and he should acknowledge that it is under-resourced. I must acknowledge the excellent work being done by the staff of the HSA on meagre resources. It is not the fault of the people of the HSA if safety on some sites is neglected. It is my understanding that the staff in the HSA are stretched to the limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about having discussions. Instilling a sense of responsibility and using words like &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; and &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; are all very well, but the contractor who cuts costs by neglecting safety and who is able as a result to undercut his competitors is playing a very dangerous game and is putting pressure on other builders to do the same. The employee who disregards mandatory safety measures is a danger to himself and to others and should either change his ways or be barred from construction sites.</P>
    <P>It is the role of the HSA to advise and supervise with regard to health and safety matters on sites, but it cannot do that without resources. At least 40 inspectors with back-up staff should be dedicated to the construction alone. The HSA would then have the wherewithal to carry out its statutory functions as required under the law. If the Minister does not fight his corner at the Cabinet table in order to radically increase the resources of the HSA, the Government must shoulder much of the blame for the deaths and accidents that may occur in the future in the construction industry. The Minister will no longer get away with blaming employers or employees in order to cover up his own inaction.</P>
    <P>This issue is too serious for fancy words and flowery speeches by the Minister, it is a matter of life and death for many people. The Government has no excuse. It has the money. Window dressing will no longer be enough. It is time for real action. I challenge the Minister to put his money where his mouth is and take action now. Give the HSA the resources and I am sure it will deliver. If that is done many deaths will be avoided and injuries prevented. The terrible heartache that many families experience will not occur in the future if the Minister moves to ensure that one of our largest industries is a safer one in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter on the Adjournment. Unfortunately, we do not have enough time for a real discussion on it but I assure the Deputy that I <Col N="120" /> intend to announce some initiatives in the coming days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep the Deputy informed. I will try to get most of my reply on the record.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety. It sets out in clear terms the responsibilities of both employers and employees in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment. Under this Act, the primary duty of care to provide a safe and healthy working environment rests with the employer. The 1989 Act specifies the duty on an employer to provide a written safety statement outlining the manner in which the health and safety of employees is to be managed.</P>
      <P>The construction sector is specifically addressed in the context of the Construction Regulations, 1995. These regulations deal with the minimum safety and health requirements on construction sites and are the most detailed legislation dealing with any one specific industry. Under these regulations, construction work is regarded as more of a project than a job. These regulations introduced the concept of a chain of responsibility, thus making health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception through to completion.</P>
      <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally sound legislation which provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety. Inspection is but one element in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, joint responsibility, commitment and participation from all sides is necessary to foster safe work practices at ground level. Nowhere is this more vital than in the construction sector.</P>
      <P>There is already a high level of trade union and employer representation, as the Deputy knows, throughout the activities of the Health and Safety Authority as they relate to the construction sector. The board of the authority is a tripartite board with equal representation from trade union and employer sides. The Construction Safety Advisory Committee is also composed of representatives of both sides of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Construction Action Programme was designed to address some specific issues surrounding health and safety in this sector. It was drawn up in 1998 by the Health and Safety Authority after consultation with both sides of industry. The main elements of the programme include the establishment of a team of inspectors dedicated to the inspection of construction sites, especially in Dublin and Cork; all public sector clients have been asked to ensure that construc<Col N="121" /> tion contracts are awarded only to firms or contractors with a safety statement in place; the development of a code of practice and accompanying video on safe scaffolding, which is a major problem; and the preparation of a code of practice for fragile roofs with a view to improving safety standards.</P>
    <P>One of the primary purposes in devising this action programme was to involve all the players in the construction sector from State to client, but there is still an unacceptably high rate of death and injury in the construction sector and the progress made in raising awareness in the context of the construction action programme must now be built upon and broadened.</P>
    <P>In view of the most recent construction related deaths, I met with the Health and Safety Authority and also with representatives of both sides of industry to discuss the overall approach to health and safety in the construction sector. I have asked both sides to meet with a view to further expanding the process of discussion and dialogue and to develop suitable mechanisms by which a national partnership approach to health and safety can be successfully transferred to site level. I want to see the creation of realistic and comprehensive programmes which will galvanise the existing national consensus on the importance of proper construction sector health and safety and which will lead to genuine improvement at site level. I expect to be in a position to announce progress in this area in the next few days.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources, I would point out to the Deputy that I am fully aware that this is an important and relevant issue. I have asked the authority to carry out an indepth review of all its present and projected staffing needs in the context of its statutory remit and responsibilities. This review will form the basis for detailed discussions with relevant Government colleagues on the question of additional resources. The Health and Safety Authority has a sanctioned staff complement of 132, 13 of which were sanctioned late last year. The authority undertook an extensive recruitment campaign earlier this year to fill all sanctioned posts and offers of employment have now been made in respect of all the advertised posts.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that prevention is the most important element of all our work. I assure the Deputy that part and parcel of the new proposals we will be announcing will be a key emphasis on prevention. We will also be concentrating on resources.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of inspectors, the figures I get from the authority vary. I will simply say that there are not enough. It is, perhaps, time to look at employing on short-term contracts retired people with experience in the building area, such as foremen, as inspectors. However, we will make an announcement on this issue in the next day or two, which I hope will bring progress <Col N="122" /> to this very important matter. I thank the Deputy for raising this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to what must be one of the most bizarre and unacceptable cases of ill-treatment of a group of Irish citizens abroad by the forces of a friendly Government that has been brought to our attention. This incident merits the delivery of the strongest possible protests by the Irish Government to the Israeli authorities.</P>
      <P>The Pilgrim House Community has been operating for a number of years from Inch, near Gorey, in my home county of Wexford. The community has been active on what would be described as a broad humanitarian agenda, campaigning for more humane treatment for asylum seekers and working with those with a mental handicap and children with HIV. The community has been in touch with me on a number of occasions over the years in my capacity as a Deputy for the constituency of Wexford. I know little of their religious beliefs, but I note that the local parish priest in Castletown said of them in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that &ldquo;they are a very committed group of people, looking after handicapped children and handicapped adults in a very dedicated way&rdquo;. He stated:</P>
      <P>They are not an extreme Christian cult. That description is way over the top.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the community decided to make a pilgrimage to Israel to visit the holy sites and mark the millennium. Accommodation had been arranged and financial arrangements were in place to support the group during its stay in Israel. There is confusion about how long they intended to stay. Some reports suggest that they intended to stay for three months, others suggest that it was eight to nine months. In any event, if the visit was to be for longer than 90 days, a visa would have been required from the Israeli authorities. The group, apparently, had no visa, so it may have been guilty of a technical breach of the immigration regulations in Israel. However, that technical breach can in no way justify what I have to describe as the appalling treatment it received at the hands of the Israeli authorities when it attempted to land at the port of Haifa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been held initially for a number of hours, members of the community were then forcibly put back on the boat on which they had arrived from Greece. They say they were punched and kicked by Israeli police and pulled <Col N="123" /> along the ground by the hair. Parents were hit with batons and punched and kicked in the ribs in front of their children, it is alleged. The door of the bus is reported to have been broken in the struggle. Two members of the group were allowed to go to the local police station to telephone the Irish ambassador to Israel, Mr. Brendan Scannell. According to their version of events, they were told to get off the telephone as there was no time. They say, &ldquo;When we objected they rushed at us, some of them had batons drawn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept the Israeli Government needs to take precautions against the activities of extreme religious cults which may use the millennium to provoke violent incidents. However, I do not accept that there were any grounds for the Israeli authorities to believe that the Pilgrim House group fell into this category, particularly given that the Irish ambassador, Mr. Scannell, devoted considerable time and energy to explaining to the Israeli authorities that they were a bona fide group and posed no threat to anybody's security. Ambassador Scannell is entitled to full credit for the actions he took to try to assist the group. However, it is deplorable that the Israeli authorities should have dismissed the ambassador's views and spurned efforts to have these Irish citizens treated in an acceptable manner.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already raised the matter with his Israeli counterpart, David Levy, at a meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. However, the matter cannot be allowed to rest there and a formal protest must be made to the Israeli Government.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who, for many years, advocated the establishment of diplomatic relations on a residential basis between Ireland and Israel. The establishment of such relations poses an obligation on each country to treat each other's citizens with civility and courtesy. In this treatment of Irish citizens and the Irish ambassador, Israel has fallen short of what we would expect of a friendly, democratic Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this important matter on the Adjournment. The Government learned yesterday morning from the Irish ambassador in Israel, Mr. Brendan Scannell, that a group of 25 people from the Pilgrim House Community in Inch, Gorey, County Wexford, including seven adults and seven children with disabilities, had arrived on a ship in Haifa the previous day. The group comprised 18 Irish citizens and seven foreign nationals. They had telephoned the ambassador to complain that some of them had been beaten, abused and traumatised. The ambassador travelled to Haifa to investigate the matter and was given further details of rough treatment meted out to members of the group by Israeli officials which resulted in two members of <Col N="124" /> the group being taken to hospital. The ambassador immediately contacted the Israeli Foreign Ministry and emphasised strongly that the manner in which members of the group were mistreated and mishandled was unacceptable.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Andrews, availed of the opportunity presented by the presence of his Israeli counterpart, Mr. David Levy, at a meeting of the EU General Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday &ndash; the latter part of which I attended &ndash; to have a special meeting with him to convey the Government's concerns that the dispute could damage relations between our two countries and to ask for an urgent review of the decision of the Israeli authorities not to allow the group to enter the country, so that the situation would be defused. The Israeli Foreign Minister undertook to do everything he could to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>The Pilgrim House Community is an independent Catholic group which wanted to bring its mentally handicapped members to the Holy Land for the jubilee year. As that would involve a stay of more than three months, it applied for visas to the Israeli Embassy in Dublin in July. In mid-September it was informed by the embassy that its applications were refused. The community then contacted the Irish ambassador in Tel Aviv, who wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 15 September asking that the refusal decision be reconsidered. When it contacted the ambassador again on 29 September, he told it the Israeli authorities were still reviewing the matter, that it would be some further time before there was a final decision and that the Israeli authorities had advised that members of the community should not arrive in the country by air on 30 September as they had planned. The community agreed to that but said that, as it had already made commitments, the group was setting out by road instead, that it would reach Haifa by 12 October and would keep in contact with the Israeli Embassy in Dublin in the meantime, and that it hoped that the visa issue would be resolved by then. The ambassador advised them not to travel and I understand that they were also strongly advised by the Israeli Embassy not to do so. The Israeli authorities view the arrival of the community in Haifa without visas as a provocative step.</P>
      <P>The ship on which they arrived in Haifa left yesterday at 7 p.m. Irish time with the group still on board and it will arrive in Greece on 14 October. In the meantime, the Irish ambassador is continuing his efforts to persuade the Israeli authorities to allow them to visit the country, even for a period shorter than the eight months they had planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, in addition, to pay tribute to Ambassador Scannell. He upholds the very highest traditions of our foreign service and his efforts on behalf of the pilgrims are much appreciated. <Col N="125" /> Deputy Howlin has rightly acknowledged this fact.</P>
    <P>I am aware of media reports just to hand that the group may have experienced difficulty in gaining access to Cyprus on its way to Greece. The ambassador in Athens has been asked to establish contact with the Greek immigration authorities, with a view to helping the group before its arrival there on Thursday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Parents caring for children under two years of age at home do not qualify for domiciliary care allowance. The original Department of Health circular, No. 24/73, was issued as far back as 25 November 1973. Parents find it difficult to come to terms with the problems which arise in the early years of a child born with a disability. The historical reason for the State not extending DCA to cover children under two years was based on the then medical assumption that many of these children would not survive to come out of the maternity hospital. However, with advances in medicine, there has been a dramatic decrease in the incidence of infant mortality. Many handicapped children under two years have disorders which put great pressure on their parents. Some suffer from epileptic seizures or need, usually a parent to change a nasal gastric tube. Some children suffer seizures from as early as four weeks and need 24 hour a day attention. One parent has described coping with a child under two years with such an ailment as living on a knife edge with a huge weight pressing down on one's head.</P>
      <P>The Jack and Jill Foundation, established to help parents with disabled children at home, estimates that it alone will have 120 families under its wing before the end of the year. More children with handicap are being born and surviving because of the advances in medical care. The rate of domiciliary care allowance is £111.20 per month so the overall cost of addressing this anomaly &ndash; we supposedly treat all children equally &ndash; is not a large financial sum, and the Minister has received the findings of a review of the matter which was completed more than 12 months ago. I hope he can inform the House that he will be in a position, possibly in the upcoming budget, to address this injustice affecting parents caring for disabled children under two years of age at home. These parents have a worthy case. I do not intend to take up the time of the House other than to hear from the Minister that he can address what is a genuine and pressing need of these parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, fully understands the Deputy's concerns. He fully appreciates the demanding role facing parents and <Col N="126" /> guardians of children of all ages with a disability, and he is very conscious of the dedication and commitment demonstrated by these carers. For many, this commitment is a life-long dedication and is not only confined to the childhood years.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile, however, to explain the nature and background to the scheme. The domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The scheme operates under section 61 of the 1970 Health Act. This section empowers a health board to make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of a sick or infirm person, a dependant of such a person, or a person who, but for the provision of a service for him under the section, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home. Eligibility is subject to a means test but only the means of the child are taken into account. For example, a child who receives a payment of compensation resulting in an income in excess of the allowance does not qualify. The rate of the allowance is £111.20 per month. More than £12 million was paid out under the scheme in 1998 in respect of 9,108 children.</P>
      <P>The criteria under which the scheme operates state that the handicap must be present at the time of the application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date and be likely to continue to last for at least another year. The necessary medical assessment is carried out by health board medical personnel. In some cases, depending on the medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals. Following such a review, if a child's condition has improved, he or she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility. These reviews also provide an opportunity to ensure that the services available and the care plan in place meet, to the extent possible, the needs of the recipient on an ongoing basis. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained in institutions. However, where a child is at home for a continuous period of more than two months, for example, summer holidays, the allowance may be granted for that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of the many requests made by concerned individuals and representative organisations urging that the scheme be extended to cover severely disabled children under two years of age. The guidelines state that &ldquo;children below the age of two are not regarded as eligible as such children normally require constant care and attention in any event&rdquo;. However, there is a view that children under two years who have a severe disability need a greater level of care than a healthy baby. The Deputy will appreciate that any decision to extend the domiciliary care allowance to children under two years of age who are severely disabled will impact not only on the scheme itself but on the provision of other assistance provided by the State in the sphere of care and income support. Issues such <Col N="127" /> as means testing and appropriate medical criteria require also to be addressed in this context.</P>
    <P>As indicated in replies to recent parliamentary questions, the Minister arranged for the issue of an extension of the domiciliary care allowance to be examined. This examination involved consultation with the health boards, concerned groups and other Departments. The review concluded that best international practice recognises the additional care required for children under two years of age with a disability. The Minister accepts that very often it is not simply a matter of care but the kind and intensity of the care required. While the international experience var<Col N="128" /> ies in the type of and eligibility for schemes, the underlying trend is to offer some support to children under two years of age. Having examined the findings of the review, the Minister remains sympathetic to the principle of extending coverage of the scheme. Consequently, he has instructed officials within the Department to consider the possibility of granting such an extension sooner rather than later. In this context, these officials are discussing the possibility of funding being sourced in the Estimates for the year 2000. I take on board what the Deputy said in regard to the forthcoming budget and consideration will be given in the Estimates.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 295 together.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am determined to ensure that every individual in this country is treated equally before the law regardless of his or her ethnic origin.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are committed to ensuring that members of the Garda Síochána receive training in race relations in view of the changing nature of Irish society and that the content of this training &ndash; for recruits and serving members &ndash; is kept under ongoing review.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all student and probationer gardaí receive instruction in the area of race relations as part of their two year education and training programme.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the social studies element of the programme deals with discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping and best practice for policing interaction with ethnic minority groups. It includes a seminar on ethnicity, traveller culture and discrimination against the traveller community. Pavee Point makes a presentation at this seminar. The social studies course also covers instruction in human rights conferred by the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights and deals with policing and human rights.</P>
    <P>The legal studies element of the training and education programme provides instruction in the relevant provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Appropriate training is also provided for Garda supervisors and managers.</P>
    <P>In April of this year, the Garda authorities hosted an international conference, co-funded by the EU Commission and the Government, entitled &ldquo;providing a police service in a developing multi-ethnic and multicultural Ireland&rdquo;. They are to be congratulated on this early initiative and their foresight and openness in addressing this question. The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a multi-ethnic, multicultural society. In particular, the training currently provided for student and probationer gardaí is to be reviewed and enhanced in the light of the outcome of this conference.</P>
    <P>In fact, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a working group has been established to review all aspects of Garda training in this area and to develop best practices in the light of ongoing changes in the policing environment. The group has an ambitious work programme and its activities are ongoing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give detailed information to the House about an individual Garda investigation or operation except where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>All I propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the cattle seizure in question is still the subject of a full and detailed Garda investigation. I understand that a file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions on completion of the investigation.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the smuggling of cattle and the implications for the contamination of the food chain are taken very seriously by the State agencies concerned. As the Deputy may remember the Garda implemented Operation Matador in 1996 as a response to this specific threat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the youth diversion programme operated by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>My Department funds a number of Garda special projects which are targeted at specific large, high density urban areas where there is a combination of a large young population, high unemployment and a lack of basic amenities. These community based, multi-agency projects have a very particular focus being directed at young people who are either involved in, or seen to be at risk of getting involved in, crime. The projects are also used to target juveniles who are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely, or are in need of emotional and developmental support due to family circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently funding 29 such projects, five of which are being co-funded by the European Social Fund and by the Exchequer. These five particular projects are being established at present. The ESF funding has been secured on the basis that the projects will have an integrated long-term employment focus to prepare participants for the workplace. The allocation of ESF funds to these projects is particularly welcome in that it is the first occasion that ESF funding has been made available for initiat<Col N="132" /> ives in the Garda area. The five projects are based in Ballinasloe, Galway, Ballybane, Galway city, Jobstown, Tallaght, Navan, Meath and Tullamore/Clara, Offaly.</P>
    <P>Details of the 29 projects, and the annual cost in each case, follow.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the numbers catered for can vary depending on whether the work is of a prevention or intervention nature. In the case of prevention fairly large numbers of young people at risk would participate. During summer programmes, up to 60 young people per project could be involved. In the case of intervention smaller numbers participate in an indepth way and numbers can vary from six to 20.</P>
    <P>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that the activities in which young people get involved are very wide ranging and would include literacy skills, numeracy skills, carpentry, art, soccer skills, hill climbing, swimming, canoeing, mechanical skills, music and personal development generally. In all projects misbehaviour is challenged and worked through.</P>
    <P>My Department has commissioned an evaluation of the Garda special projects by the Children's Research Centre, Trinity College, and I am expecting a copy of its report shortly.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have expanded the number of projects from 12 to 29. This is testimony to the fact that I value the work being done in this area by the Garda, statutory agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups. The programme is the subject of ongoing review and the potential for further development is always a factor in these deliberations. The report of the Children's Research Centre will also be a factor in regard to the future direction and content of the programme.</P>

      <P>Having comprehensively analysed the board's submission, I can confirm that I fully accept the board's case for additional resources. As a consequence, my Department made a detailed and substantial case to the Department of Finance and has indicated that it is regarded as a priority issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in reported rapes in recent years seems to be due to a number of factors which I have outlined before in the House. Among these factors are the higher incidence of rape in the present day, historic cases from previous years being reported in the present day and, perhaps, an increased willingness on the part of victims to report rape which may be due to the availability of better services for victims in the present day.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda Síochána actively pursues and investigates all reported crimes of a sexual nature, including rape. The domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit, which was established in 1993, was given a national remit in 1997 in the area of sexual crimes. I have been advised that the Garda Síochána continues to enhance its knowledge and expertise in the investigation of such offences by ongoing training.</P>
      <P>I have spoken in the House before of a number of research projects which have been undertaken in recent years some of which are still ongoing. The Garda research unit has undertaken research into rape statistics following an increase in the number of crimes reported to the Garda in this area while the figures for crime generally were on the decrease. The results of the research were published in early 1998. It was subsequently decided to extend the research and phase two is currently under way. The current research project will focus on the experiences of victims of rape who report to the Garda. It will also try to quantify the attrition rate at each stage from reporting a case to case outcome and to suggest how the processing of cases might be improved with particular reference to Garda practice.</P>
      <P>The publication of the findings of the &ldquo;Legal Process and the Victims of Rape&rdquo;, a GROTIUS funded research project, was launched on 25 September 1998 and it was jointly carried out by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the school of law, Trinity College. The research project reviewed the legal process and victims of rape in all 15 EU member states.</P>
      <P>Finally, my Department is funding a research project into the reasons why there are high attrition rates in bringing prosecutions in rape cases. This research is being carried out by University College Cork and the Cork and Kerry Rape Crisis Centres, and I expect that its findings will be published early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to introduce a register of sex offenders. In February last I sought and obtained Cabinet approval for the <Col N="136" /> preparation of heads of a Bill to provide for the establishment of a register of sex offenders, the principal focus of which is to be on offences against children. On 1 June, following consideration by the Cabinet of the heads, I received approval for the drafting of the Bill. In addition to the register, the Bill will deal with post-release supervision of sex offenders by the probation and welfare service, and separate legal representation in certain circumstances for complainants of rape and serious sexual assault.</P>
    <P>These measures arise, in the main, from the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I published in May of last year, and are in line with the responses received to that paper. Preparation of this legislation is being given a high priority within my Department and I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill during the current Dáil session.</P>

      <P>There is a traffic corps with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement in each Garda division.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 57 sergeants and 364 gardaí are assigned to the traffic corps. In addition to traffic corps members, all uniformed gardaí throughout the State are involved in road traffic enforcement as required.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to increase the overall strength of the force to 12,000 by the year 2002. This increase would ultimately allow for some flexibility for deployment of additional gardaí to traffic law enforcement should the Garda Commissioner consider it necessary.</P>
      <P>I might add, however, that the question of the deployment of gardaí is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiting times for appointments with solicitors at each of the 30 law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board as at 31 August 1999 are set out in the table which I will have circulated in the Official Report. In three law centres the waiting time for an appointment was one month or less, in eight law centres it was between one and three months, in four law centres it was between three and six months, in ten law centres it was between six and 12 months, in three law centres it was between 12 and 18 months and in two law centres the waiting time was greater than 18 months.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Legal Aid Board I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres. I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources. However, where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board intends to extend the scheme on a nationwide basis in the coming months. The private practitioners scheme provides a complementary legal service to that which is already available from the law centres. The expansion nationwide of the private practitioners scheme should increase the throughput of legally aided cases and also enable the law centres to devote <Col N="138" /> more resources towards non-District Court matters.</P>
    <P>Also the board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis. For example, 1,879 of the 8,722 appointments offered in law centres in 1998 were for priority matters. None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists. In the Dublin area, 911 appointments were offered through the private practitioners scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board in 1998.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the increase in waiting times I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million and I further increased the allocation to £11.953 million this year, an increase of 24 per cent on the 1998 allocation. In addition I allocated £1 million for legal services for asylum seekers, bringing the total current allocation to £12.953 million, an increase of 34 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>The board has sanction for 89 solicitor posts. Recently a recruitment competition was held which resulted in the filling of all existing solicitor vacancies in the board apart from the vacancy at its Dundalk Law Centre. I believe that these appointments are helping to alleviate the situation with regard to waiting times in the law centres.</P>
    <P>In concluding, it should be noted that in the eight months to the end of August 1999, waiting lists in 17 law centres were reduced, significantly in some cases, while increases were experienced in ten law centres.</P>

      <P>There are two reasons which resulted in the delay in bringing the new prison in Cloverhill into usage. A difficulty arose with certain areas of flooring which subsequently resulted in extensive testing being carried out. Independent professional advice had to be sought. As a result, corrective measures have been suggested. The proposed solution has been tested on certain floors in Cloverhill and I am awaiting the final test results.</P>
      <P>Snagging took longer than anticipated to complete. All building works in a prison are a security and safety issue and it is, therefore, vital that all snagging works are completed before offenders are taken into the prison.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that in any major building project, in line with international prison practice, certain security works do not form part of the contract and are undertaken by the prison authority. These security works, which include lockings, can only be undertaken when all contractors and subcontractors are off site. These security works are nearing completion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>There are ten offenders undergoing the dedicated group sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison. At present there are 25 offenders on a waiting list for the Arbour Hill programme.</P>
      <P>However, this number is not static and may rise or fall depending on the motivation of any individual offender at a particular time. Where the number of suitable applicants exceeds the number of places available on the programme, priority is given to offenders whose release dates are closest. All those who apply and who are deemed suitable for group treatment are accommodated prior to release.</P>
      <P>In addition the probation and welfare service and the psychology service in my Department provide one to one counselling for offenders. The number of offenders undergoing one to one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided for sex offenders in prison. Such counselling can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling.</P>
      <P>There were 341 convicted sex offenders in custody in Irish prisons on Thursday, 7 October. They were housed in the following institutions:</P>

    <P>It is not possible to quantify the number of rehabilitation places in each institution. All prisoners are involved in a rehabilitation programme of one type or another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> Since coming to office I have made it a priority to enhance the treatment options available to all prisoners, including sex offenders. To this end I approved the establishment of an expert group on the probation and welfare service in November 1997 and a group on the psychology service in December 1998 to examine and report on the future needs, structure and organisation of both services. The final report of the expert group on the probation and welfare service was published recently and the report of the group examining the psychology service is under consideration at present and should be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>Both of these services are recruiting extra staff at present. This will enhance the range of one to one counselling available to offenders. In addition, it is intended that the Curragh place of detention will have priority in the allocation of resources to enable the introduction of a dedicated sex offender treatment programme in the prison, similar to the programme which has been operating successfully in Arbour Hill for a number of years. I must point out, however, that the absence of generic psychological services in the Curragh Prison will, in all likelihood, delay the establishment of a full programme until next year.</P>
    <P>I have instructed the newly appointed director general of the Irish prison service that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is to be given priority attention. In the meantime, all convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are housed, are invited to take part in the programme in Arbour Hill.</P>

      <P>There are currently no plans to provide for the transfer of members of UK police forces to An Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, as amended, prescribe the criteria for admission of trainees and appointment of members to the Garda Síochána. While the regulations make no provision for direct transfer to the Garda Síochána from UK police forces, they do not include any requirements as to nationality or residence. Similarly, I am not aware of any facility for direct transfer of members of the Garda Síochána to UK police forces or for transfers between EU police forces, generally.</P>
      <P>In the context of training, the Garda authorities avail themselves, as far as possible having regard to operational commitments, of opportunities which arise for exchanges of personnel between the force and other law enforcement agencies. There are numerous examples of such arrangements. These include exchanges between gardaí in the Garda Training College and their counterparts in other police training colleges and exchanges of personnel for the purpose of language training. These exchanges facilitate the study of criminal justice systems in other jurisdictions and help to establish useful police contacts.</P>
      <P>There are also more structured exchange arrangements in place. During its Presidency of the European Union Ireland brought forward proposals in the Justice and Home Affairs Council for the establishment of a framework, including funding arrangements, to develop and enhance co-operation between European Union police, customs and other law enforcement authorities. This initiative, known as the OISIN programme, was adopted at the Dublin Council on 20 December 1996. The programme envisages co-operation between member states' law enforcement authorities in the form of exchange and training.</P>

      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of underage drinking are included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. The primary purpose of those statutory controls is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it, or to consume it other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>I also made arrangements earlier this year to introduce a voluntary national age card scheme which will greatly strengthen the existing measures aimed at curbing the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age. Any person who has attained 18 years of age is entitled to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station. The introduction of the scheme will make a significant contribution to the continuing fight against underage drinking.</P>
      <P>Of course measures aimed at curbing the supply of alcohol to young people cannot, on their own, be expected to solve the underage drinking problem. Measures are also required which deal with the demand for alcohol among under 18s. The Garda plays a prominent role in this regard in participating in school programmes which deal with the abuse of alcohol by young persons. The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are also very much involved in measures that address the demand side of the problem.</P>
      <P>Statistics for each of the past five years where proceedings were taken against the holders of on-licences and off-licences relating to the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years are as set out below.</P>

      <P>The core recommendation of the 1998 annual report of the director of the prison medical service is for an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. This recommendation was echoed in the recently published report on the prevalence and risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV in Irish prisoners. I have no hesitation in accepting this recommendation and I have asked the director general of the prison service to bring forward proposals for a multidisciplinary review group as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the director general will continue working with the director of prison medical services to improve the prison medical service. In particular, work is continuing in the recruitment of nurses. Twenty-three nurses have been recruited to date with further recruitment due in November. Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance on the recruitment of a pharmacist and a nursing co-ordinator. A multi-disciplinary prison service steering committee is continuing to oversee all aspects of communicable diseases. Research has been completed on the prevalence and risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV in Irish prisoners. This report was published in late August and the recommendations are under consideration in my Department at present. I have approved an action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system. The action plan builds on the agreed medical policy between my Department and the Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
      <P>The comment of the director of prison medical services that a situation may arise in the near future where it would not be possible to meet statutory or other obligations in the medical sphere was made specifically in the context of the impending opening of large new prisons and the relative scarcity of medical professionals. This shortage also causes recruitment difficulties for the prison service. However, every effort will be made to ensure that all prisoners can continue to avail of the required level of health service while in custody.</P>

      <P>The offences referred to in the Deputy's question are all covered by the terms of the Bail Act, 1997, which, following the 1996 constitutional amendment on bail, provides in section 2 that a court may refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act, or any provision or provisions of it will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the full implementation of the Bail Act is not yet possible because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>The Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 governs gaming and lottery activities, other than the national lottery, and is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental review group. The group is due to report by the end of this year and its terms of reference are as follows: to review the regulatory environment within which gaming and lottery activities are carried out with particular reference to the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act, any other relevant or proposed Irish legislation, and international developments in the gaming and lotteries area; to identify the issues arising from such a review and to make recommendations designed to address these issues in the context of securing a modern regulatory environment while fulfilling necessary social policy objectives; to furnish a report on the above for consideration by the Minister and by Government by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>As regards gaming machines in public houses, gaming is expressly prohibited in licensed premises under section 9 of the 1956 Act, and I am informed by the Garda that there have been a total of 203 prosecutions under the Act in the years 1997 and 1998 of which 148 have resulted in convictions. The number of prosecutions in respect of licensed premises during the same period was 51.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware of reports that gaming machines are operating openly in some licensed premises and that tokens or credit systems are sometimes used in lieu of cash in the operation of these machines, thereby frustrating prosecutions under the Act.</P>
      <P>It is in the light of such enforcement difficulties as well as the broader issues now emerging in this area that I decided on a comprehensive review of this Act.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that over the last two months the Garda has been called on 22 occasions to attend at the building site of the new Dáil Éireann offices.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that upon arrival at the site on each occasion, the Garda discovered the protesters walking in front of vehicles entering and leaving the site. I understand that when the protesters were asked to move away by gardaí, they did so, with the exception of one occasion on Monday, 4 October 1999. On this date, 19 protesters were arrested for wilful obstruction of a garda in the execution of his duty. I understand that the 19 protesters were released when their names and addresses were verified at Pearse Street Garda station and proceedings are to be instituted by way of summons.</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed to learn, yesterday, of the rejection by the membership of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, of the recommendations of the adjudication board on the final phase of the local bargaining clause of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
      <P>The pay element of the adjudication board's recommendations, which included substantial retrospection, was a very significant award and was linked to productivity elements identified and agreed in discussions between management and the GRA, including proposals for new fostering arrangements in designated urban areas. It should, also, be remembered that the award is in addition to the interim pay deal valued at 9 per cent which was agreed with the association last year and which included an advance payment of 2 per cent on future productivity.</P>
      <P>I believe the leadership of the GRA is as aware as I am of the extent to which the Government has gone to try to resolve the Garda pay issue and, indeed, the association's central executive committee recommended acceptance of the recommendations of the adjudication board to its members. I must categorically state that the Government cannot go beyond the adjudication award and I would strongly urge the GRA to review its position and, like the vast majority of the public service employees, accept the pay settlement within the parameters of the PCW, which in this case is the adjudication award.</P>
      <P>As guardians of the public interest and in fairness to all employees who have resolved their claims under the PCW, the Government is not prepared to contemplate any improvement on that award.</P>

Following representations made by my Department, the UK authorities advised that they are in the process of collating the necessary documentation and reports required and, when that has been completed, they expect to be in a position to forward their applications for my consideration.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the convention on the transfer of sentenced persons requires that extensive documentation be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place i.e. from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents &ndash; assuming they will be forthcoming &ndash; an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his-her continued detention here.</P>
      <P>These procedures are as required under the convention and must be adhered to in considering any application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for these applications to be considered.

      <P>I dealt with this matter at some length in my reply to a priority question on 5 May last. I then outlined that the allegations referred to by the Deputy related to the method of investigation of crime, including an allegation that bomb making material had been planted so the Garda could claim credit for it.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that investigations led by an assistant commissioner into all aspects of the allegations are continuing. This is a very complex investigation and extensive inquiries remain to be carried out. However, I am assured by the Garda authorities that every effort is being made to bring all the matters currently under investigation to a conclusion. If appropriate, criminal prosecutions and disciplinary action will ensue.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that there are obvious constraints on what I can say on the matter while the investigation is continuing. I must also have regard to the fact that matters at issue are the subject of civil actions, and complaints made to the Garda Complaints Board are also being investigated.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have further informed me that arising from facts established to date the Commissioner decided to suspend a member from duty. The member remains suspended and a file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>A very wide range of legal and technical difficulties are experienced world-wide in effectively policing the Internet. However, following the report last year of the review group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet, a system of self-regulation by the service provider industry is now being implemented. In this regard, my Department has been informed that the industry will shortly establish a public hotline for reporting complaints about child pornography on the Internet. Following on the recent decision by the industry to provide the hotline, a special Internet advisory board <Col N="154" /> will now be established to overview the implementation of the self-regulation arrangements, as also recommended by the review group. International co-operation both by the hotline and the board will be crucial to addressing the overall problem of child pornography on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Apart from its proposed membership on the lnternet board, the Garda is involved on an ongoing basis with the investigation of child pornography on the Internet. Its powers in relation to this jurisdiction are provided by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998. I have no plans to increase these powers.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply of 15 June, the Garda Commissioner had been urgently undertaking a comprehensive review of Garda &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; arrangements in the child care area generally. This review is clearly of the utmost importance relating as it does to the security and safety of children but inevitably quite complex, as it is also essential to safeguard the privacy and other rights of individuals. Accordingly, the modalities for operating the extended Garda clearance arrangements envisaged require very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that this review has now been completed and is with the Garda Commissioner who is considering the operational procedures and resource requirements to support the Garda clearance system in the area in question. I expect to be hearing from the Commissioner in this matter shortly after which I will make a further statement.</P>

      <P>The accommodation requirements of the Garda Síochána were the subject of an in-depth examination in 1992-93, which sought, among other matters, to assess how the existing stock of Garda accommodation meets Garda needs, having regard to the changing nature of the force and the necessity to make the most efficient use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Arising from this study, comprehensive briefs of requirements were prepared for each type of Garda station, specifying required facilities in a modern policing arrangement. Every Garda station built since has conformed to these specifications, and major refurbishments of existing stations take account of these comprehensive briefs, where circumstances allow.</P>
    <P>Moreover, my Department is continually engaged in evaluating and monitoring progress in the Garda building programme and maintenance plan, with a view to enhancing the standards of Garda accommodation, as resources allow and overall priorities dictate.</P>

      <P>Committal statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. In 1994, the latest year for which the information sought by the Deputy has been published, the total number of persons committed to prison for default of fines was 2,173. This represents 21 per cent of the total number of offenders committed in 1994.</P>
      <P>The following figures, as yet unpublished, give details for 1995 and 1996. The figures are not yet available for later years.</P>

    <P>It is worth noting that, at any one time, approximately 1 to 1.5 per cent of prison spaces are taken up by persons committed for non-payment of fines.</P>
    <P>A new £6 million information technology programme for the prison service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database will be deployed across the prison service early next year. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation.</P>

      <P>The service is organised into five regions with 19 local offices and there is an office in each of the 15 penal institutions.</P>
      <P>The workloads of service personnel assigned to courts are demanding and vary from area to area. The figures in the following table include pre-sanction reports ordered by the courts, probation orders, community service orders and deferment of penalty. The figures shown are as at 1 August 1999 as they are the most up to date available and will vary slightly from month to month. The figures for those in custody show the number of staff working in each of the fifteen penal institutions.</P>
      <P>The workloads in some areas are much heavier than in others, but every District Court district area has at least one officer.</P>
      <P>The following table does not include the one senior probation and welfare officer and three probation and welfare officers assigned to work with young offenders in special schools, neither does it show the two probation and welfare officers assigned to staff development or the one senior probation and welfare officer and two probation and welfare officers assigned to the research unit or staff assigned to the Adoption Board.</P>
      <P>The agreed increase of thirty nine posts, earlier this year will enable a more comprehensive service to the courts reducing workloads significantly.</P>

      <Quest>if the shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of An Garda Síochána for dealing with CCTV applications has been resolved; and if he is considering an application for the extension of CCTV to Navan, County Meath.</Quest>

      <P>The telecommunications section in the Garda Síochána is responsible for the planning and implementation of town centre Garda CCTV systems. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. I am having this problem addressed as a matter of urgency through the recruitment of 27 additional technicians. The recruitment process is now almost complete and 17 new technicians have been appointed. However, given training needs and so forth, it will, realistically, be some months before the new technicians will be available to commence work on new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV systems as an aid to policing and to evaluate each application has received in excess of 40 applications &ndash; including one from Navan &ndash; for the installation of Garda CCTV systems. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing by the CCTV advisory committee. The list of locations, in alphabetical order, is as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin south central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick. Currently the Cork city and Dublin south central Garda CCTV projects are being processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining applications, including Navan, are still under consideration by the committee and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as staffing and budgetary resources permit. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and my Department. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera. Each application for a Garda CCTV system must also be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda <Col N="159" /> district and divisional officers and receive their full support.</P>

      <P>The incident referred to by the Deputy arose in the wake of an assault by one prisoner on another. When prison staff intervened, they in turn were attacked by a group of prisoners. Order was quickly restored and a number of prisoners were moved to other parts of the prison. Eleven prison officers and one seriously injured prisoner required hospital treatment.</P>
      <P>Two investigations are under way into the incident &ndash; an internal investigation by the Governor of Mountjoy Prison and a Garda investigation. The principal focus of both investigations is the assault on the seriously injured prisoner. I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot comment further at present as both investigations are ongoing.</P>

      <P>My Department published a report of a survey of equal opportunities in semi-State bodies on Tuesday, 5 October 1999. The survey is the third survey commissioned to monitor progress in relation to equal opportunities in the State sponsored sector. The evidence of the survey is that, in general, little progress has been made in the sector since the 1993 survey which related to 1990 data.</P>
      <P>Arising from the survey, I have asked the Equality Authority designate to act as a locus for facilitating the systemic change required in many of our State bodies, if equality of opportunity is to begin to become a reality. I will be communicating the results of the survey to my ministerial colleagues in the case of each State sponsored body under the aegis of their Departments. I have arranged also for officials to give performance feedback to State sponsored bodies on an individual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> The primary responsibility for implementing and progressing the equality agenda at the level of each State sponsored body rests with the body itself. The work which requires to be done calls for resources of expertise, personnel and funding. It is clear that quite a few of our State bodies have yet to devote the resources needed to advance equality in their workplaces. Others may need to give more priority to equal opportunities policies as part of their strategic management plans. The specifics of any new process will fall to be worked out between interested State enterprises and the Equality Authority. My Department will ensure that progress continues to be monitored and reviewed until we have effective equal opportunities policies and practices in place in our State bodies.</P>

      <P>Funding for peer reviewed basic and strategic research is provided by this Department through the Office of Science and Technology to the National Research Support Fund Board, an independent board under the aegis of Enterprise Ireland. It is this independent board which decides on the allocation of funds, following an annual call for proposals. The board was established to decide on the allocation of funding for research projects under the operational programme for industry. The board is, accordingly, constrained by the necessity to avoid supporting research which falls more directly into the responsibility of the Health Research Board, which is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The proposal for the funding of the Ocular Genetics Unit in Trinity College Dublin at a rate of approximately £500,000 per year for five years was outside the normal process of the annual call for proposals. Notwithstanding that, I asked Enterprise Ireland to examine it in order to identify its potential for assistance. Following the examination, it became apparent that the type of research involved came within the area of responsibility of the Health Research Board. In this circumstance, funding was not possible through the National Research Support Fund Board.</P>
      <P>However, Enterprise Ireland identified two areas where assistance could be provided and the proposers were advised accordingly. These were the identification of potential opportunities for funding under the European Union Fifth Research Framework Programme; and assistance with the setting up of a campus company and the related support in raising venture capital. This would allow focused research to be undertaken which would be aimed at developing products. I understand that the proposers have made preliminary enquiries with Enterprise Ireland in relation to the above.</P>

Many women returners avail of the services of FÁS, either for employment placement or for training, and such supports can frequently be more appropriate than going onto schemes such as community employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The return to work programme, for which there is no live register requirement is particularly suited to women returning in that it helps participants to develop the confidence necessary to re-enter the labour force, and is also an <Col N="164" /> important bridging programme for progression onto other FÁS programmes. The programme is delivered on a part-time basis within local communities and in 1998 was completed by 1,065 women. Others move directly into skills training programmes and into enterprise training and from there directly into employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>As of now, I have no plans to further expand the eligibility conditions for community employment or associated programmes. However, a working group, representative of the social partners is currently considering the issue of access by women to labour market opportunities and any further change that might be contemplated in eligibility conditions to active labour market programmes will be considered in the light of the outcome of that study.</P>

      <P>There is no database kept by my Department or by the enterprise development agencies of raw materials used in manufacturing here. I am not, therefore, in a position to definitively answer the Deputy's question in this respect. I am aware, however, that a company in Wicklow produces mercuric iodide soap which is used in the treatment of tropical skin conditions.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority, which comes under the auspices of my Department, is the national body responsible for the promotion of occupational safety and health and related matters, and for the administration and enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions in this area. Under current legislation administered by the authority, there is no statutory requirement for companies involved in the manufacture of products containing mercury to be licensed by the authority.</P>
      <P>The EU list of dual-use goods &ndash; i.e. goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes &ndash; which are subject to export control contains two items with &ldquo;mercury&rdquo; in their title. These are mercury amalgam pumps and mercury cadium telluride crystals and epitaxial wafers. My Department has never issued export licences in respect of either product. My Department is not aware if any other controlled products contain mercury as a component.</P>

      <P>Community employment is primarily a transitional programme to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. The main criteria for the approval of CE projects is the support they provide for the re-integration of the participant back into the labour market. The need to support the re-integration of disabled persons is also taken into account here. There are no quota arrangements for the individual groups currently accessing the CE programme, and there is no proposal to introduce such an arrangement at present. However, it has always been the practice to accept, as immediately eligible for CE, persons with a disability who are certified by the NRB and to endeavour to place them on a suitable project as soon as possible. I do not anticipate any change in these arrangements either in the context of the restructuring of CE or of services for persons with a disability.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. There are ten inspectors operating at present. As well as the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, the labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the enforcement of worker rights set down in a variety of labour legislation and of statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers employed in sectors covered by employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans to upgrade and strengthen the Department's labour enforcement staff are well advanced. It is hoped that their present numbers can be significantly expanded in the not too distant future in the context of the new and expanded responsibilities foreseen for them in <Col N="167" /> the context of the enforcement of the national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>Of the 872 inspections carried out under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, in the period 1 January to 31 December, 1998, non-compliance with the Act was revealed in 44 instances. There have been 474 inspections concluded in the year 1999 to date. There have been no prosecutions taken to date in 1999 but consideration is being given to initiating prosecutions in a number of cases. A successful 1998 prosecution wherein fines totalling £4,500 were imposed, has been appealed to the Circuit Court. That case came up for hearing on 4 October last and is currently adjourned for hearing on 18 October next.</P>
    <P>Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur a follow-up inspection is usually carried out after a suitable lapse of time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work in relation to the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996 is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes most efficient use of the enforcement resources available to me. A comprehensive, six-month long, enforcement campaign commenced by the labour inspectorate in April and focusing on the catering sector nation-wide is continuing. It is expected that 1,000 cross legislation inspections will be carried out in the course of this campaign, particular attention being paid to compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns expressed by various groups in relation to the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons and would urge anyone with information in relation to breaches of the Act to notify the employment rights division of such breaches. I am confident that all such reported breaches will be dealt with expediently and that every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with this and indeed any other employment rights legislation.</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed to learn of Sealand's decision to close the Cork operation. The Sealand facility was <Col N="168" /> intended to centralise the company's administrative and customer service functions in a shared services centre in Cork. The closure of the operation arose as a result of the takeover of the company and the fact that the new owners preferred to have offices in each country of operation rather than a centralised service. The IDA will hold discussions with the new owners, the Maersk shipping group, to assess the feasibility of maintaining a presence in Cork. In the event that this proves unsuccessful, the IDA will concentrate its efforts on securing a replacement investor to provide additional jobs in Cork.</P>
      <P>On a more positive note, I am pleased that there has been a significant upturn in the employment position in the region in the last few years. So far this year alone, over 1,100 new jobs have been announced for the Cork area and I am confident that additional investment projects will be secured.</P>

      <P>Information from our embassies and consulates indicates that there are about 770 Irish persons in prison abroad. When it comes to their attention that Irish citizens are in custody for any reason, Irish embassies and consulates ensure that they have access to a lawyer, that they can communicate with relatives or friends if they wish, that they are not discriminated against on the grounds that they are foreigners or Irish and that they can benefit from any offer of bail. Embassies and consulates, which normally offer to visit citizens in custody or in prison, inform them about the local prison regime, its welfare service, entitlements as regards medical attention, visits, telephone calls, post and money transfers and about the possibility of legal aid. They also usually have direct contact with the lawyers acting for the Irish citizens.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>I visited the United Nations General Assembly in New York from 20-30 September last. As in previous years, my attendance offered an ideal opportunity to have discussions on important issues of bilateral and international concern with Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and other representatives of more than 60 UN member states as well as the UN Secretary-General and other senior UN officials.</P>
      <P>These discussions were extremely productive in terms of exchanging views on many of the issues currently on the international agenda, including the challenges facing the international community as we approach the new millennium; the role and effectiveness of the UN in implementing the goals and principles of the charter; and more immediately, efforts to resolve ongoing humanitarian crises such as in East Timor and in many parts of Africa. The meetings also afforded the opportunity to promote our Security Council candidacy among the broad UN membership.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Security Council election is a contested one. I am reluctant, therefore, to enter into the precise details of contacts which Ireland is having with other states in this regard. I can say, however, that I am gratified by the broad support that Ireland's candidacy has attracted and which was evident during my visit to New York.</P>

      <P>I fully recognise the difficult conditions under which the regional airports operate and I am very much aware that the abolition of duty free has added to their difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to supporting the regional airports and has stated so in the Programme for Government. As the Deputy is aware, the Government has maintained and enhanced a range of regional airport grant schemes with a view to sustaining the regional airport network into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1996-99 marketing scheme, an annual sum of £588,000 was made available to assist the airports with the very necessary work <Col N="173" /> of winning new customers and exploiting new markets. The sum was, in fact, increased to £700,000 this year. A further provision of marketing funds will be proposed by my Department for the year 2000, to be considered by Government in the context of next year's Estimates for Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government also made Exchequer funding of £5 million available last year, to enable the regional airports carry out a range of infrastructural developments. In the context of the National Development Plan, which is currently being finalised, proposals are being considered in my Department for further capital expenditure assistance for the regional airports. Of course, any recommendations made by me in this regard, will be a matter for the consideration of the Government.</P>
    <P>In addition, four of the six regional airports are served by a public service obligation route under the essential air services programme. This programme receives an annual subvention of £3.3 million.</P>

      <P>A considerable amount of physical work has been undertaken on the Maynooth line during 1999, concentrating on site preparation including the slewing of the existing track, laying of ballast, drainage and the lowering of tracks at bridges. Some platforms have been lengthened and the remainder will be finished in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Almost eight miles of new track will be laid during 2000. Iarnród Éireann plans to have the whole infrastructure project completed on schedule by the end of 2000. New rolling stock for use on the service is also expected to be delivered by late 2000.</P>
      <P>When this work has been completed, it will be possible to introduce improved and more frequent services. It will not be possible for Iarnród Éireann to increase the number of services in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in order to augment capacity during peak hours, Iarnród Éireann intends to increase the Longford morning and evening train by two carriages. As the train length will then exceed the platform length, the company has agreed a safe method of operation for this service with the rail<Col N="174" /> way inspecting officer in my Department. The necessary technical work to comply with this agreement is expected to be completed within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Safety at level crossings is being addressed in the implementation by Iarnród Éireann of the Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003. The company plans to invest some £88 million over that period to mitigate safety risks at over 600 level crossings which were identified in a special study carried out for Iarnród Éireann by consultants A.D. Little. Risk mitigation measures have already been carried out this year on 40 crossings and work is expected to be completed on a further 30 before the end of the year. This is in line with the target for 1999 in the railway safety programme.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has instituted an internal inquiry into the accident at Woodfarm level crossing near Dromkeen, County Limerick on 5 October 1999. The company will take account of the findings and recommendations of that inquiry in its ongoing evaluation of level crossing safety.</P>
      <P>I have received a preliminary report from one of my railway inspecting officers who travelled to the accident site on the morning it happened. She will follow up any relevant matters with the company and in due course review the findings and recommendations of the Iarnród Éireann inquiry.</P>

In so far as agriculture is concerned, the General Affairs Council confirmed the position adopted by the Agriculture Council on 27 September, 1999 that: the negotiations on agriculture will be based on the mandate provided in Article 20 of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture which conditions the long-term objectives of trade liberalisation by other concerns, notably the experience and effects of implementing the commitments agreed in 1994, non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to establish a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system; the EU position will be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council in Berlin in March, 1999; the EU will be prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided the concept of the blue and green boxes will continue; similar instruments to the peace clause and the special safeguard clause will be needed in the future; the EU will take forward the multifunctional role of agriculture, food safety, food quality and animal <Col N="179" /> welfare, and the EU will actively promote special and differential treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries.</P>

However I understand that most exports of cattle to the Continent, other than calves, consist of weanlings.

Written approval to commence the investment works issued on 30 November 1990 with a stated lapse date of 8 June 1992.

It is a condition of the scheme that land taken on lease must be for a minimum of five years from the date of first setting up as a full time farmer. In this case, the applicant's five year lease commenced prior to the date of setting up and therefore an extended lease is required to cover the period 1/1/1998 to 31/12/2003 to enable the application to be further examined.</P>

    <P>*The person named lodged this 10 month application on 5 August 1998 for 17 animals. He subsequently wrote to the special beef premium unit on 21 August outlining that there was an error on two cards submitted. He again wrote on the 24 August 1998 and requested that those two animals be withdrawn from the application. The special beef premium unit then deleted the two animals from the application and paid the remaining 15 animals without penalty. In accordance with the EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme those two animals while not paid special beef premium must be counted for stocking density purposes.</P>

      <P>An area aid application form was not received from the person named by the closing date for receipt of appli<Col N="182" /> cations of 15 May 1998. However, on the basis of the postal certificate submitted in May 1999, it was agreed that a late application would be accepted. The area aid application for the person named was subsequently processed, and some payments were made.</P>
      <P>While the person named applied on 30 suckler cows under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme, payment is based on his suckler cow quota of 26 cows. At the time payments under this scheme commenced last year, my Department did not have any record of an area aid application in respect of the person named. As EU regulations provide that a person may qualify for payment of premia up to a maximum of 15 livestock units where there is not a valid area aid application, the person named was initially paid his grants under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme based on 15 suckler cows. He was paid an 80 per cent advance of £1,564.97 on 15 January 1999 and the balance of £391.24 on 3 February 1999, with both amounts subject to a 7 per cent late application penalty because the composite application form for suckler cow premium and cattle headage was received seven working days after the official closing date. A supplementary payment of £1,434.55 will now issue in respect of the remaining 11 suckler cows.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of £2,287.19 under the 1998 cattle headage scheme on 13 May 1999. The grant was subject to a 7 per cent late application penalty and to forage area limits as set out in clause 27 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme. He was paid his full entitlement of £722.02 under the 1998 extensification premium scheme on 15 June 1999.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under the provisions of section 268(1)<i>(d)</i> Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 a building in use for the purposes of the trade of hotel keeping is regarded as an industrial building. A person who incurs capital expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of such a building qualifies for capital allowances at the following rate: Year 1, 15 per cent; Year 2, 5 per cent; Year 3, 15 per cent; Year 4, 15 per cent; Year 5, 15 per cent; Year 6, 15 per cent; Year 7, 10 per cent.These capital allowances can only be given in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of the building or structure occupied for the purposes of the hotel trade and are not extended to other investments or activities carried out by the party claiming the allowances.</P>
      <P>There is no ring-fence on the offsetting of the capital allowances against non-rental income in the case of hotels of a three star standard or higher which are located in seven counties in the north and west of the State, including County Sligo, apart from any designated seaside resorts located in these counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballymote, County Sligo is qualifying rural area for the purposes of the scheme of tax reliefs <Col N="188" /> aimed at invigorating certain areas of rural Ireland. Section 372N of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for accelerated capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of certain commercial buildings or structures such as retail shops, restaurants or offices which are used for the purposes of a trade or profession.</P>
    <P>Further information would be required in order to determine whether, and to what extent capital allowances would be available for the coach museum mentioned by the Deputy. If the developer wishes to discuss the project with the Revenue Commissioners he should make contact with the direct taxes incentives branch of the Revenue Commissioners about the matter.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that in addition to the capital allowances regime the taxpayer may be able to avail of the scheme of tax relief for investment in corporate trades, more commonly called the business expansion scheme. The benefits of the BES apply to certain tourist traffic undertakings involved in export tourism. Under the scheme individual investors may obtain tax relief on investments they make in certain tourism companies. In order to qualify for BES the tourism company must obtain a certificate from Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>

      <P>The first £1,000 of a chargeable gain accruing to an individual in a year of assessment is exempt from capital gains tax. This annual exemption was introduced in the Capital Gains Act, 1975 at £500, was increased in 1982 to £2,000 and changed to £1,000 in 1992. However, since 6 April 1998 the transfers of all or part of one spouse's unused exemption to the other spouse is now no longer allowed. Of course, where assets are held jointly then both individuals are entitled to make use of their individual exemption of £1,000.</P>
      <P>I am informed that in the United Kingdom an individual has an annual exemption of £7,100 which is allowed against the chargeable gain. Both spouses are entitled to this annual exemption amount. While this limit is significantly higher than the rate applying in Ireland, most capital gains in this country are charged at a rate of 20 per cent as opposed to 23 per cent and 40 per cent in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to exemption limits applying in <Col N="189" /> other EU member states, I regret to inform the Deputy that it has not been possible in the time allowed to ascertain the limits, if any, that apply in these countries as this information is not readily available.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's proposal for an increase in the current exemption limit, I have no proposals to increase the exemption limit at present.</P>

      <P>The ESRI consultancy, &ldquo;National Investment Priorities for the Period 2000-06&rdquo;, and the Fitzpatrick studies commissioned by the two regional assemblies recommended, in the context of the National Development Plan 2000-06, the application of a gateway approach to balanced regional development. Gateways are centres which have a strategic location relative to the surrounding territory, have the potential to open up their zones of influence to further development by providing transport links with contiguous zones and possess good social and economic infrastructure and services. In this regard, the Government is conscious of the relevance of a national spatial framework to act as a context for the co-ordination of policies aimed at achieving balanced and sustainable regional development. The implementation of such a framework would require the preparation of a national spatial strategy. These issues, including the development of gateways and the designation of growth centres, are under consideration by the Government in the context of the finalisation of the national development plan which will be published in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent working group which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me last October. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The chairman of this group, supported by the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU), recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. However, this was not the unanimous finding of the group.</P>
      <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, a point that must be borne in mind is the fact that there is an EU dimension which must be carefully examined. While the EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid, one consideration, I believe, which influenced their decision is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax. This is a point which should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the working group. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to meet with the ILCU in this regard.</P>

The implementation of the commission's recommendations has been under examination by an interdepartmental task force and the costs of disability payment is one of the items under consideration. The task force will be issuing a progress report in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>Since this Government took office in 1997 a total of £38.162 million additional funding has been provided for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In line with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, this funding has mainly been allocated to address historical deficits in the voluntary sector, to address identified core underfunding of existing services and to develop a number of services such as respite, residential, home support, including personal assistance, day care, therapy services and sheltered employment. Once-off funding has also been provided for the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 1998, a total of £2.762 million has been provided for respite and residential services; £841,000 for day activity/day resource services and £902,000 for home support services, including personal assistance services. This year capital funding of £457,000 is being provided for respite and residential services and £1.477 million for day activity and day resource services. The allocation of development funding provided to the health boards in 1999 &ndash; £3 million, with a full year cost of £6 million in the year 2000 &ndash; is being finalised by a number of the boards in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Since 1997 an additional 87 respite care places and 46 residential places have been put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle which underpins the development of services for children and adults with disabilities is to enable each person with a disability to live as full and independent a life as possible. The provision of appropriate day, residential, respite and support services is essential to meet this objective. Community based services are now the preferred model of care and most families are anxious to care for their children at home for as long as possible, with the assistance of appropriate day services and back-up support. The availability of respite care in particular is essential to support the family in looking after a child with disabilities. In a minority of cases, depending on the needs of the child, longer term residential placement in either a campus based setting or community housing may be required. Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, and despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of additional residential, respite and day services for both children and adults with disabilities and in particular those with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding the development of specific services, including residential services, for both children and adults with disabilities are taken by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for services to persons with intellectual disabilities and physical and sensory disabilities and in line with the identified priorities for each health board region.</P>
      <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services for persons with an intellectual disability. This included specific provision for the expansion of respite services. It also included £1.5 million (with a full year cost of £2.5 million) for the further development of health related support services for children with autism. Capital funding of £10 million from the national capital programme has been allocated to support the development of these new services. Revenue funding of £6 million has also been provided to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>Similarly, a total of £13.4 million additional funding is being provided this year for the maintenance and development of services for persons with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £3 million &ndash; £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000 &ndash; has been allocated for development of services and £4 million for capital projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that within the context of the <Col N="194" /> national development plan, and the Estimates for 2000 which are currently being finalised, I will be able to maintain and hopefully accelerate the pace of development and expansion of services to both children and adults with disabilities.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the crisis in the accident and emergency department of the Mater Hospital, Dublin 7; and the responses in the short and long term which he plans to deal with this problem.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19460/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities regarding the difficulties being experienced in the accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital and have been informed that the delays being experienced are due in part to the unusually large number of patients attending the department. The recent bed closures due to nursing shortages are further exacerbating the problem. The hospital management, conscious of these unusual factors, is managing the situation on a day-to-day basis. It has also put a number of initiatives in place in order to attract more nursing staff to the hospital. These include conducting interviews for nurses in the United Kingdom; improving car parking for nursing staff; providing study leave for approved courses; facilitating flexible working hours and putting educational facilitators in place to address issues regarding post registration nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in November 1997, I approved phase 1 of a major redevelop<Col N="195" /> ment programme for the Mater Hospital campus, to include the accident and emergency; out-patient department; hospital sterile services department and operating theatres, at a cost limit of £25 million. In May 1998, I approved the appointment of the design team for the development and the planning is now under way.</P>
    <P>With regard to problems in accident and emergency departments generally, the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional funding was used primarily for the launch by the Eastern Health Board of a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, and also the development of a range of initiatives in major accident and emergency departments. Within this funding, the Mater Hospital received an allocation of £200,000 this funding was deployed for the provision of additional accident and emergency staff in order to alleviate pressures in the accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>This year I provided further funding of £2 million to enable major acute hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in our accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>As part of this overall funding, a sum of £210,000 was allocated to the Mater Hospital for accident and emergency improvements. The hospital has undertaken a number of measures to improve systems for dealing with patients attending the accident and emergency department and I hope they will provide a more acceptable environment for patients and alleviate some of the current problems.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and I am committed to ensuring its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long wait<Col N="196" /> ing lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address these problems, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes were merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes. The new scheme effectively merges the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly improves the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies to meet the needs of patients and is subject to ongoing review and is updated on a monthly basis. Dressings and incontinence products are available on a supplementary list basis to cater for the special needs of older people.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also wish to know that the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement which is being introduced over a three year period began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for persons aged 70 to 79 and persons aged 80 years and over which are already higher than the normal guidelines have increased by one third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.</P>

These criteria are as follows: the treatment concerned is not available in this country; there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment; there is a reasonable medical prognosis; the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment and is recommended by the patient's consultant; the treatment is to be carried out in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 to 196, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that secretin is a hormone which has been used for many years as a diagnostic aid in certain gastrointestinal disorders. More recently there have been anecdotal reports from the United States of its beneficial use in children with autism. The product is not licensed by the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; the successor to the National Drugs Advisory Board &ndash; nor is there any application for its licensing pending. Any future applications received for authorisation of the product will be considered under the normal process of evaluation carried out by the board.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the product is not the subject of a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board, it is not eligible for inclusion in the list of reimbursable items under the general medical services scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secretin treatment for autism is still at the experimental stage. Clinical trials have yet to <Col N="200" /> report on its efficacy and on the long-term side effects of using this treatment. Ultimately, a decision as to whether a particular treatment is introduced is a matter for clinical decision by doctors treating patients in the light of clinical trial results, experience and what is considered best practice. My Department will continue, however, to follow any progress in relation to clinical trials and research in this area.</P>

      <P>The average number of new cases of HIV reported to my Department over the past five years is 107 per annum From 1 January 1999 to 31 May 1999, 76 new cases of HIV have been reported.</P>
      <P>Irish figures on HIV-AIDS reflect those in the developed world, with a lowering of cases and deaths from AIDS in recent years but a rise in the number of cases of HIV. The rate of increase has, however, stabilised. However, we must not become complacent about this condition and my Department will continue to give priority to HIV and AIDS. For this reason the national AIDS strategy committee is undertaking a review of all aspects of HIV-AIDS, with the aim of publishing an updated strategy in December 1999.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 additional funding has been provided each year for health boards to respond to the problems of drugs and HIV-AIDS. HIV is strongly linked with intravenous drug misuse, with 42 per cent of HIV infections being drug misuse related. To respond to this health board services include methadone treatment and needle exchange in the range of services for drug misusers. The gay HIV prevention strategies project has developed a range of interventions among the gay community aimed at lowering the incidence of HIV in homosexuals.</P>
      <P>My Department also continues to make available a range of materials and literature to educate the public, especially young people about the dangers of HIV-AIDS. The health promotion unit has run a media campaign to coincide with national and world AIDS days. Specific messages have been placed in the washroom areas of third level colleges and some night clubs and pool halls. Most recently the decision by the Department of Education and Science to introduce relationship and sexuality education into schools will also contribute to creating a greater awareness of the issues among young people.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> The task force to which the Deputy refers is the Irish St. Vincent declaration action group which was established by the Irish Endocrine Society in 1995. It is representative of a broad range of groups working with diabetes. I understand the report of the group will be submitted to the Department in the near future, and it is anticipated that it will include a review of current knowledge of the condition in Ireland. This is likely to consist of an examination of existing facilities and developments, with recommendations in relation to necessary developments in services. I look forward to receiving this report.</P>

The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland recommends immunisation against hepatitis B for residents and carers in institutions for persons with intellectual disability. Additional revenue funding was provided for the health boards and voluntary intellectual disability agencies by my Department in 1995 for the provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for staff working in the intellectual disability services and client groups considered to be at risk. This funding has continued to be provided in the agencies' budgets. The question of additional funding in 2000 and associated administrative arrangements for the provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for certain at risk groups is being examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996, which give effect to the provisions of part VII of the Child Care Act 1991, provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
      <P>Certain exemptions from the provisions of part VII of the Act are provided as follows: (a) the care of one or more pre-school children undertaken by a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such relative; (b) a person taking care of one or more pre-school children of the same family and no other children, other than that person's own such children, in that person's home; (c) a person taking care of not more than three pre-school children of different families, other than that person's own such children, in that person's home.</P>

      <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence.

      <P>To date this Government has provided a total of £38.162 million for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments.

      <P>As asthma is not a notifiable disease, there are no precise statistics available on the number of people with the condition. For the most serious asthmatic reactions requiring hospitalisation, data is available from the hospital in-patient inquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system. The data available in respect of males and females for 1998 is set out on the attached table. These figures are based on principal diagnosis and include day cases and in-patients. It should be noted that information is not available from private hospitals and that a person attending hospital several times in a given year is counted separately in the statistics for each visit.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes were merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>Persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. In this regard, income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State to those with ongoing medical expenses such as people with asthma.</P>

      <P>The most recent survey of nursing vacancies, carried out by the Health Service Employers' Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; related to the position at the end of April 1999 and found that there were 566 staff nurse vacancies, all but 30 of which were in the Dublin area. There were no vacancies in hospitals in the Southern Health Board area. However, there were 13 vacancies in mental handicap agencies in Cork. I have asked the HSEA to carry out a further study of the position at 30 September 1999.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that when Cork University Hospital advertised for nursing positions in March 1999, it received 250 applications. Similarly, 166 nurses applied for positions in Tralee General Hospital when it advertised in February 1999. This shows the continued high level of interest in nursing positions in the Southern Health Board area.</P>

    <P>In 1999, I provided a total of £1.145 million to the hospitals in the Southern Health Board area under the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that nationally, the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent, since the beginning of this year. The reduction in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996. The results are the first time in which waiting lists have fallen in two successive quarters.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tack<Col N="209" /> ling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
    <P>I also allocated £9 million to services to older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services, with the aim of freeing acute hospital beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

    <P>In 1999, I provided a total of £1.145 million to the hospitals in the Southern Health Board area under the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that nationally, the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent, since the beginning of this year. The reduction in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996. The results are the first time in which waiting lists have fallen in two successive quarters.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
    <P>I also allocated £9 million to services to older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services, with the aim of freeing acute hospital <Col N="210" /> beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

    <P>In the past there have been some difficulties in obtaining standardised statistical information nationally. These difficulties will be addressed in the review of the child care data system which is being undertaken shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998 which came into operation on 23 January, 1999 provides protection from civil liability to persons <Col N="215" /> who report child abuse &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; to designated officers of health boards or the Garda. In addition Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children which I launched on 21 September last, update the child abuse guidelines with a view to strengthening the support and guidance for health professionals, teachers and members of the gardai, and the many people in sporting, cultural, community and voluntary organisations who come into regular contact with children. The objectives of the national guidelines are to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse; to clarify the responsibilities of various professionals and individuals within organisations and to enhance communication and co-ordination of information between disciplines and organisations.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are among the conditions prescribed under the Act. Drugs which are directly related to the treatment of these conditions are made available free of charge. The operation of the scheme is primarily a matter for the relevant health board and information on the operation of the scheme with regard to the provision of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension arising from diabetes has been sought from each <Col N="216" /> health board. I will communicate directly with the Deputy when comprehensive information is to hand from all health board areas.</P>

      <P>Post traumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder, which occurs when a person is exposed to an extremely traumatic event such as a major accident, rape or other severe physical experiences. Persons suffering from post traumatic stress disorder are encouraged to talk about the events frequently and to release pent-up emotions on each occasion. Long-term residential care is not normally indicated for post traumatic stress disorder. Instead, skilled and persistent counselling and debriefing sessions are provided immediately after the traumatic event to reduce the frequency and severity of the disorder. In-patient care is provided by the appropriate hospital services, if required.</P>
      <P>The trend in recent years has been to treat patients suffering from psychological illnesses as far as is possible in a community setting. Out-patient clinics are now provided in 240 locations in the various mental health services throughout the country. In addition, 1,113 places were available in 69 day hospitals and 2,349 places were available in 108 day centres at the end of 1997, the latest year for which published figures are available. Where in-patient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital, beds being allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. On the basis of the information available to me, I understand that the carer's allowance is generally not treated as income by the health boards in assessing medical card eligibility. I will write to the chief executive officers asking them to address this issue with a view to ensuring that the general interpretation is applied consistently.</P>

The figures for 1997 and 1998 have been extracted from the annual financial statements of the health boards. These statements are submitted by the boards to the Department early in the following year. Therefore, the 1999 figures will not be available until March 2000. The financial figures for 1999 are the original determinations. The expenditure on administration includes those elements in respect of administration associated with direct patient care such, as for example, scheduling appointments and staff in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that the 1998 expenditure figures included in the table are unaudited. However it is unlikely that these figures will change significantly following the audit.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to extend the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which deals with anti-social behaviour by tenants to householders; his views on whether the law is weak in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997 in relation to anti-social behaviour are directly linked with the statutory estate management responsibility of housing authorities in relation to dwellings owned and rented by the authority. Local authorities do not have a similar estate management responsibility in relation to privately owned housing. The provisions of the 1997 Act are not, therefore, capable of extension to householders generally, who, to the extent that they may be engaged in anti-social behaviour are, of course, subject to the normal legal code which is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>As with any new development, the establishment of a new purpose-built child care facility requires planning permission. Where a child care facility is established in a pre-existing dwelling, planning permission may also be required for two reasons, firstly because it represents a material change of use of the dwelling and secondly, where external works are required to accommodate the child care facility. There is currently no specific exemption in the planning regulations with regard to child care facilities.</P>
      <P>My Department has commenced work on the preparation of guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities with a view to publishing draft guidelines for public consultation early next year. In this context, the question of whether or not certain types of child care facilities should be exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission will be considered.</P>

      <P>Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a toxic malodorous gas listed on the US environmental protection agency's list of extremely hazardous substances; it is not regarded as a greenhouse gas. Emissions of H2S are a side effect of the operation of catalytic convertors in vehicles when purging sulphur depositions from the catalyst. However, the amounts emitted from vehicles are minute. Consequently, emission factors for vehicles are not set in EU legislation nor has an EU ambient air quality standard been set or proposed for H2S.</P>
      <P>The EU auto oil programme requires more stringent environmental specifications for fuels with up to 70 per cent less sulphur in petrol and 30 per cent in diesel; these measures will facilitate further reductions of H2S emissions. I am satisfied, to the extent of the knowledge available to me, that this gas has no discernible effect on Irish ambient air quality.</P>

      <P>The 1999 budget introduced a once-a-year payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care. This payment was paid on 3 June and benefited some 12,000 carers at a total cost of almost £2.4 million.

      <P>Those eligible for assistance under the SWA scheme would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment and would have to satisfy a number of criteria, including a means test. In addition, people with low incomes may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, for example, diet, rent, heating, or a payment to assist with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of SWA payable in all cases is the difference between the person's means and the minimum weekly income prescribed in legislation for the household type in question. Household income is taken into account and will reduce the <Col N="226" /> amount of SWA payable. Any income above the SWA rate is taken as means unless specific provisions have been made under legislation to disregard certain payments.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is treated as income in the means test for basic SWA, heating, diet and other supplements. However, it is partially disregarded for the purposes of rent and mortgage interest supplements. The amount disregarded when assessing entitlement is the rate of carer's allowance in payment less the current SWA qualified adult dependant allowance where the carer is one of a couple. If the carer is single, the rate of carer's allowance less the personal rate of SWA is disregarded.</P>
    <P>Any change in the means test would have major cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for treatment &ndash; dental, optical and aural &ndash; benefits requires people over 21 years of age to have had at least 39 weekly PRSI contributions paid or credited in a particular tax year governing the claim. This is normally the last complete tax year before the beginning of the calendar year in which the claim is submitted.</P>
      <P>Where a person satisfies the qualifying conditions for entitlement to treatment benefits on attaining the age of 60 years, he/she remains entitled for life thereafter. In effect, this will apply to persons retiring not more than one complete tax year before the beginning of the year in which their 60th birthday falls. Where a person ceases to be insurably employed before that, entitlement will normally lapse after a residual period of up to two years.</P>
      <P>However, a person who retires on grounds of ill health, or who is deemed to be unemployed, may apply for disability or unemployment benefit, subject to satisfying the statutory conditions. In addition to any payments that may be due, entitlement to such benefits may also result in the award of credited contributions which can be taken into account to extend coverage for treatment benefits for further periods.</P>
      <P>Any changes to the qualifying conditions to grant indefinite entitlement to persons who retire before reaching 60 years of age would have significant financial implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>if homemaker credits will be awarded to those people who spent their lives working in the home, rearing a family and unaware they should have been signing on the live register which adversely affected their pension credits.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19500/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home face difficulties in maintaining their social insurance record as they could not sign on the live register for credits, due to the availability for work condition. The Government has, therefore, given a commitment under An Action Programme for the Millennium &ldquo;to provide the mechanism to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Certain measures have already been introduced to address this problem. Special arrangements are in place to help people who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted. It is estimated that up to 250,000 people could ultimately benefit under the above arrangements.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that in November 1997 I introduced new <i>pro rata </i>pensions so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent. To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. This measure is of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full-time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with its stated commitment, the Government accepts that more work needs to be done in this area. My Department is now considering the issue on a three-fold basis. First, the issue is being examined in the context of the general review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which, it is hoped, will be completed shortly. This review will consider the present disregard arrangements and alternatives such as the award of credited contributions and the question of retrospection. <Col N="228" /> Second, an in-depth examination by the Department of the general provisions of the homemakers scheme will also get under way later this year. However, I should point out that any change to the present arrangements &ndash; particularly in the area of retrospection &ndash; would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. Third, the issue of supplementary pension provision, is being considered by the Department in the context of the pensions board report on the national pensions policy initiative (NPPI). In its report, Securing Retirement Income, the Pensions Board recommended that occupational pension coverage targets also include specific targets for increased coverage of women in both employed and self-employed areas.</P>
    <P>The board considered that the proposed introduction of personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs) would greatly facilitate the position of women with broken employment records due to</P>
    <P>child care and other responsibilities. The working group, chaired by my Department, which was set up to examine issues relating to the introduction of PRSAs, is making good progress. The outcome of the group's deliberations will be reflected in the comprehensive pensions Bill which I hope to publish as early as possible in 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the situation of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 whose pension reduces each year; if the pension calculation is correct; when the report into pre-1953 contributions will be issued; and if he will make early changes for individuals like this who had reduced pensions and years of pre-1953 stamps.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of retirement pension at the weekly rate of £86.90. This is the correct rate based on the person's yearly average of 42 contributions paid and/or credited from 1953 until he reached retirement age in 1989. To qualify for retirement pension at the maximum rate, £89.00 at present, a yearly average of 48 contributions is required.</P>
      <P>The level of increases provided to recipients of reduced rate contributory pensions is determined by the percentage relationship between the reduced rate and the appropriate maximum rate of payment. This is the system which has operated since the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme and it applies equally where the general increases are provided on a percentage basis or, as has been the case in recent years, on a monetary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue of contributions paid prior to 1953, I would point out to the Deputy that such contributions did not contain a pension element. Notwithstanding that fact, pre-1953 contributions are taken into account for the purposes of satisfying two of the qualifying conditions for <Col N="229" /> retirement/old age contributory pension, namely that a person must (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age and (ii) have, at least, 156 contributions paid.</P>
    <P>The report to which the Deputy refers, relates to a review by the Department of the contribution conditions applying to the retirement and old age contributory pensions. This review is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>I will report to the House when the review has been considered by the Government, but I have to say that any change to the existing situation in relation to the treatment of pre-1953 contributions would have to be carefully considered in the context of overall budgetary resources.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of widow's contributory pension since 7 February 1992 and the current weekly personal rate is £87.10. She is also in receipt of a fuel allowance of £8.00 per week during the fuel season. In addition, she is in receipt of free travel, free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence.</P>
      <P>The maximum rate of payment of carer's allowance payable to persons over 66 years of age is £81.50 per week. Therefore, it is financially more beneficial for the person concerned to remain in receipt of widow's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Where a person in receipt of a widow's pension applies for a carer's allowance, she will receive the higher payment &ndash; there is no loss of income. In the majority of cases persons in receipt of a widow's contributory pension would be better off remaining in receipt of this payment, and the Department will ensure that this is the case.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue.</P>

His or her pension is calculated according to the insurance record in each country, the rate of payment corresponding, on a pro-rata basis, to the periods of insurance completed in each country.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and they must satisfy a specified means test. Carers allowance is a qualifying payment under the <Col N="232" /> terms of the scheme. However, those in receipt of carers allowance are subject to the same means test as other applicants and their income may be over the specified limits.</P>
    <P>The income limits for the allowance are based on social welfare payments and are automatically raised each year in line with the budgetary increases in those payments. Any change in the means test would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>However, a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme has recently commenced as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations and the suggestion that the income limits be extended or that certain payments be disregarded in the calculation of means will be examined in that context.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, applications for assistance from those who do not qualify for payment under the scheme may be considered by the health board for an exceptional needs payment, ENP. The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.</P>
    <P>ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. Each case is dealt with on its own merits.</P>

    <P>The arboretum, including the house, was purchased by my Department in 1996 for £250,000. <Col N="234" /> The purpose in my Department acquiring the property related specifically to the arboretum, with its internationally renowned mature plant collection and also its long association with the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, another major heritage property in the care of my Department.</P>
    <P>It was a condition of the Department of Finance approval to my Department for the purchase of the Arboretum that the house be retained as a ruin. There are now concerns, however, about the further deterioration of the House and it is proposed, therefore, to carry out works to stabilise the shell of the house and retain it as a feature of the arboretum, thereby maintaining the relationship of the house and gardens in context.</P>
    <P>The house is listed in the Wicklow county development plan and this will be a major consideration in deciding the approach to be adopted in carrying out the works to stabilise the House.</P>

      <P>The meeting of the European Council which will take place in Tampere this week will deal with all aspects of the policy to do with justice and home affairs matters. The Presidency has indicated that discussions will focus on immigration, asylum and related issues, combating cross-border crime, closer co-operation in civil law maters and on how best, in dealing with non EU states, issues of concern in justice and home affairs matters can best be addressed.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Union in these areas are set out in the Amsterdam Treaty &ndash; in the case of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters in Title VI of the TEU and in the case of visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons, Title VI of the TEC.</P>
      <P>In the Government's view this meeting of the European Council provides a welcome opportunity to set, at the highest political level, priorities in areas which are of major concern to European citizens.</P>
      <P>While there will, obviously, be discussion on asylum and related matters it is not anticipated, given the wide agenda and the need for the European Council to also discuss drug trafficking, money laundering, the right of victims of crime, access to justice, crime prevention, civil law co-operation that there will be detailed discussion of the definition of a refugee during the council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the wording of Article 63(1) of the Amsterdam Treaty ensures that measures taken in the area of asylum etc. <Col N="237" /> must be in accordance with the 1951 Convention and other related treaties.</P>
    <P>On the specific point raised by the Deputy, any participation by Ireland in measure to do with Title IV of the TEC requires prior approval by the Dáil and Seanad, in accordance with Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations, 1999 (SI No 4 of 1999) provide for a voluntary national age card scheme whereby any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The regulations came into effect on 19 April 1999.</P>
      <P>An applicant for an age card must present in person his or her application in writing to the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station for the area in which he or she normally resides. The application must be in the form set out in the First Schedule to the regulations and be accompanied by the applicant's birth certificate, at least one other document that confirms the identity of the applicant, two recent identical passport size photographs of the head and shoulders of the applicant and the prescribed fee set out in the Second Schedule of the regulations. If everything is in order, the member in charge at the local Garda station will authenticate the identity and age of the applicant, countersign the application form and forward it to the Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square who have been given responsibility, under the regulations, for the issuing of the cards. The Garda authorities have advised that it takes four to five working days for an application, properly made, to reach the community relations section. The prescribed fee is forwarded to the Garda District Officer for lodgement in the Garda Síochána Vote of my Department in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations also provide that when an application has been received at the community relations section the designated member there shall, subject to the provisions of the regulations, arrange for the preparation in the section of an age card for the applicant as soon as possible. Article 5(6) of the regulations provides that the <Col N="241" /> Garda Commissioner may, as an alternative to age cards being prepared within the community relations section, enter into an arrangement with a body, to be known as &ldquo;the issuing body&rdquo;, whereby the body concerned shall prepare and issue cards on behalf of the Garda Síochána. Such an arrangement has been entered into and Article 5(7) provides that in such circumstances on receipt of an application, the designated member shall arrange for one photograph and the application form to be forwarded to the issuing body &ndash; who, having prepared the age card, shall issue it to the applicant and shall return the application form to the designated officer in the Garda community relations section with confirmation that the age card has issued. Provided the application is in order, the turn around in the community relations section takes two working days, that is, two days from receipt of the application form to forwarding it to the issuing body.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that, to date, some 2,500 age cards have been issued. The issuing body indicated at the outset that the card would be issued within three working days of receipt of the application and posted to the applicant. Due to technical and other difficulties experienced by the issuing body a backlog has occurred. The issuing body has indicated that the backlog will be eliminated this week. The anticipated average length of time to process an application and issue a card should then be in the region of ten working days. The Garda authorities have also informed me that, when the backlog has been cleared, approximately 3,700 age cards will have been issued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Details in relation to all road accidents reported to the Garda authorities are supplied by the Garda to the National Roads Authority, and a detailed report on road accidents entitled Road Accident Facts is prepared and published by that <Col N="243" /> authority.

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, his Department is considering to deal with the child care crisis, in particular with regard to access to child care for people living in disadvantaged areas and families who are dependent on social welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of child care services in disadvantaged communities acts as a key support to enable parents to avail of education, training and employment opportunities, thereby tackling the causes of poverty. Also of importance are the social benefits provided to children of disadvantaged communities who are then positioned to avail of state investment in education and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>This rationale underpins my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. The programme has a budget of £11 million for the period 1998 and 1999, approximately £9 million of which has been directed to disadvantaged communities. The balance has been allocated to employer involvement in child care provision, development of the national voluntary child care organisations whose membership base comprises service providers and a research project in relation to family friendly policies.</P>
      <P>The programme has provided capital grants to 106 community-based child care projects and is funding the salary costs of two senior child care workers in 25 flagship community support child care projects. Training and development supports are also being provided for these projects and to partnerships and community groups to assist them in providing quality child care. Although the programme has yet to complete its 1998-99 phase, it is clear that it is making a vital contribution to improving the quality and quantity of child care provision in the communities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also chaired the interdepartmental committee on child care which considered <Col N="244" /> the child care proposals in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and recent relevant reports as directed by its terms of reference. The committee considered a range of child care issues, including support for the development of child care services and supports for parents to access services, and has submitted a report to Government as requested. The Government has noted the committee's report and has referred it for consideration to a ministerial group, which I am chairing, and which includes the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science. Future supports for child care will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>Various initiatives in the area of juvenile crime aim to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour The programmes can improve the quality of life of young people, through various outdoor activities, communication skills and personal development training and they also help promote gardaí-community relations.

      <P>There are currently 105 life sentence prisoners in custody as of 8 October 1999. They have served various periods in prison ranging from individuals recently committed to one particular prisoner committed in 1964. Just under 40 of these prisoners have already served in excess of ten years in custody.</P>
      <P>Life sentences are indeterminate sentences and no set period of time is considered a life sentence. Each case is dealt with on its own merits and the length of time spent in custody by offenders serving life sentences can vary substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentence review group is a non statutory body established in 1989 to advise in relation to the administration of long-term prison sentences. All offenders who have served a term of seven years or more of a current sentence, including life sentences, but excluding offenders serving sentences for capital murder, may, if they so wish, <Col N="247" /> apply to have their cases considered by the group. Between 1 January 1998 and 8 October 1999 39 life sentence prisoners had their cases reviewed by the group. Two of these prisoners, who I might add had been reviewed on a number of occasions, were subsequently released.</P>
    <P>In total, 72 offenders who were committed on life sentences are currently on release in the community. The majority of these offenders served between nine years and 16 years in custody. In practice, most such offenders were granted renewable temporary release whereby, unless the</P>
    <P>conditions of release are breached, there is no requirement to return to prison except to renew the temporary release at specified intervals. Offenders on renewable temporary release must be of good behaviour. Other conditions could include supervision by the probation and welfare service, reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station etc. Temporary release automatically ends if any conditions are breached in which event the individual concerned can automatically be returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings. There are currently seven such prisoners in custody who have been recom<Col N="248" /> mitted following their failure to abide by the conditions of their release.</P>
    <P>The criteria applied in reviewing the cases of life sentence prisoners includes the following &ndash; potential risk to the public; the seriousness of the offence committed; behaviour while in prison; the views of the Garda Síochána; compassionate grounds and recommendations by the sentence review group. The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public.</P>

    <P>(a)It should be noted that these decisions refer to the year in which the decisions were taken and NOT to the year in which the applications were lodged.</P>
    <P>(b)The practice of granting temporary leave to remain at the first instance ceased with effect from December 1997 following the introduction of revised procedures for processing claims as notified to the UNHCR. The granting of temporary leave to remain is considered by the Minister after the asylum process.</P>
    <P>(c)The grounds on which it may be determined that an application for asylum is manifestly unfounded were introduced in December 1997.</P>
    <P>(d)In addition a total of 452 cases were withdrawn in 1998 prior to the implementation of the procedures for deeming cases abandoned. These cases are reflected in the statistics in Table 1 in the category &ldquo;applications withdrawn before decision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Information for the years 1990 and 1991 are not readily available. The footnotes in respect of the information at table 2 are self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>The numbers seeking asylum here continues to rise. The total number of asylum applicants this year has already exceeded the total figure for 1998 with 4,743 applicants to 8 October 1999. The numbers applying during 1999 increased from 234 in January to 453 in June but jumped dramatically from 571 in July to 938 in September. There are a number of factors which may have influenced this rate of arrival, including the matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to supply information regarding the number of applicants who may have arrived in Ireland from Great Britain. This information would only be available if applicants were stopped by immigration officials at the ports of entry and my Department advised accordingly by the Garda Síochána, as is the case in a small number of cases. However, records in my Department are not maintained in such a way as to enable these figures to be extracted without the diversion of a disproportionate amount of staff resources which at this time would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>It is the fact that in excess of 80 per cent of asylum applications are lodged &ldquo;inland&rdquo; at the Refugee Applications Centre in Mount Street. Less than 20 per cent of applications are made <Col N="250" /> to an immigration officer on arrival. This would suggest that most asylum applicants enter the State without coming to the attention of immigration officers or concealed in vehicular traffic, the majority of which originates or transits the UK. In the absence of fingerprinting, the mechanisms of the Dublin Convention have been ineffective in returning to the UK those applicants whose applications are the responsibility of the UK authorities. I hope this situation will change in the near future with the introduction of fingerprinting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, the penalties in Irish law for offences against children, including child sex abuse, are severe. One such penalty that has not been increased for many years is that for cruelty to children. The Children Bill, 1999, which I published recently, proposes to raise the maximum penalty for cruelty to children from two years to seven years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of sentencing, the Deputy will be aware that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application. In so far as consistency of sentencing is concerned, I consider it important to mention that the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a review of what appears to the director, to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission who specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Its report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the Commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the judiciary and, this year, I made £60,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the Institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention that section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court Judges to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines <Col N="253" /> and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission also made reference to the issue of sentencing. The working group suggests that judicial education could be addressed by a judicial standards body in liaison with the Judicial Studies Institute. This new body could, <i>inter alia,</i> provide a monitoring and analytical service on matters such as sentencing along the lines of the judicial commission in New South Wales. The House will be aware in this regard, that the chief justice has established a judicial committee to consider,<i> inter alia, </i>the recommendations made in the working group report.</P>

      <P>At present neither district court offices nor the gardaí may accept payment of fines imposed in criminal cases by instalment as the current law provides for payment of court fines in full by the due date. However, the question of the payment of fines by instalment is one of the issues that arises for consideration in the context of the proposed legislation on attachment of earnings for the non payment of fines. Work on the drafting of an Attachment of Earnings Bill is currently at a preliminary stage in my Department.</P>
      <P>My proposals in this matter are being prepared in the context of the imminent establishment of the Courts Service and against a background of the major IT development programme which is currently under way in the courts.

      <P>The Government announced on 13 October 1998 that it had agreed to commission a feasibility study for the development of a national stadium and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct the feasibility study and to make recommendations based on the findings of the study. The steering committee is chaired by Mr. Dermot Keogh and includes representatives from major sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consortium of consultants led by PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed to conduct the feasibility study. The study examined a range of issues relevant to the feasibility of developing and operating an 80,000 seat stadium, including the <Col N="256" /> economic, social and other benefits that can be expected to be derived, analysed potential demand for use of the facilities from various sporting, entertainment and other commercial categories and possible locations for the stadium.</P>
    <P>The feasibility study has recently been completed and has been presented to the stadium steering committee. It will be brought to Government for consideration and decision at an early date. I do not wish to pre-empt the findings of the feasibility study but I can assure the Deputy that the Government will take all relevant matters into account in reaching a decision on the project, including issues relating to the siting of the stadium.</P>

      <P>The Government set up the young people's facilities and services fund &ndash; YPFSF &ndash; last year to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The three year fund aims to attract young people in those areas, at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
      <P>Last April, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion allocated over £25 million from the fund for expenditure over the next three years on support for locally developed integrated plans comprising 295 facility and services projects in the local drugs task force areas &ndash; 12 in Dublin and one in Cork city. The allocation was made on the basis of the recommendations of an inter-agency assessment committee, chaired by an official from my Department.</P>
      <P>An amount of £0.5 million was also allocated at the same time to support a number of nationwide initiatives to inform and raise awareness of the dangers of drug misuse, particularly through peer education. Additional funding has since been earmarked under the YPFSF to support drug prevention strategies to be developed locally, with the VEC acting as the lead agency, in urban centres where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, specifically including south Cork city, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Bray and Carlow.</P>
      <P>As a result, £1 million from this fund has already been allocated to implement strategies over the next three years in Galway and south Cork city, where a contribution of £100,000 from the Irish Youth Foundation has been made to support projects in Togher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> In the case of Limerick city and Carlow, the respective vocational education committees have submitted their strategies which are currently being examined by the assessment committee. I understand that decisions on funding to support their implementation will be made at an early date. In the case of Waterford city and Bray, the city of Waterford VEC and County Wicklow VEC are currently finalising their strategies for submission to the assessment committee.</P>

      <P>In April of this year a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced for FÁS participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme.

      <P>Disability benefit is a payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness. This payment is not means tested and usually short term.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323, 350 and 354 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement whereby students pursuing post-graduate courses at approved colleges in Northern Ireland can apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance has historically been a feature of the higher education grants scheme. In 1996-97, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible student's following full-time under-graduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state. The course must be followed in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. Certain courses are excluded, such as courses which are subject to quotas on intake in Ireland. The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at <Col N="261" /> post-graduate level and accordingly, there is no grant aid available for students pursuing post-graduate studies at English universities, such as the University of Oxford.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to extend the current arrangements with effect from the current year and, indeed, I should point out that any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses in other parts of Britain and to the EU generally, could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the document referred to by the Deputy and will be considering its contents.</P>
      <P>This school year is seeing the first allocation of additional teachers to second level schools for some years. This year provision was made for 225 additional teachers and this, together with the retention of some 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed, is enabling us to provide a remedial teaching service in every second level school and also to bring all disadvantaged schools into the home school liaison scheme. I have also made improvements in the provisions available for guidance in our schools with a guaranteed minimum allocation now available to every school.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing for additional teachers, I have this year introduced a new retention ratio for secondary schools. The impact of this is to retain in schools teachers who would otherwise be liable to be redeployed. In all, some 150 teachers have been retained under this initiative and these teachers will continue to be available to improve the quality of education in our schools.</P>
      <P>In the 1998-99 school year the pupil teacher ratio at second level was approximated 15.4 to 1. Allowing for the increase of some 225 teachers and a projected drop in enrolments, it is expected that the pupil teacher ratio will reduce to approximately 15.1 to 1 in the current school year. Within this, there are a large number of very small classes.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the principal concern in relation to class size must be the impact on educational attainment. In this regard, the great body of research indicates that the major impact of class size is to be found in the early years of primary education and for disadvantaged groups in particular.</P>

Today, Irish is an integral element of school curricula in Ireland, at both first and second levels, and all pupils are required to study the language unless granted an exemption on clearly specified grounds from doing so.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> It has been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year. The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1997 to March 1998 was 4.6 per cent. The reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year were therefore increased by 4.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increase in the reckonable income limits was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. The Deputy will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing demands in the education sector.</P>

      <P>Currently, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme for the employment of secretaries that was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this scheme a number of primary schools qualified for a shared secretary and Scoil Áine, Raheny, is currently involved in a sharing arrangement with Scoil Eithne, Edenmore. This scheme, is however, being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts that are being shared.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Scoil Áine currently receives £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the existing secretarial post fall vacant, my Department will provide Scoil Áine and Scoil Eithne with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost of secretarial services, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school, in <Col N="264" /> accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>

      <P>The last general expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level took place in 1994. The school referred to by the Deputy did not apply for inclusion on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that <Col N="265" /> disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the schoolgoing population. This study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at schools with the greatest concentration of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the study's recommendations, resources which. subsequently became available were targeted on schools selected to participate in the breaking the cycle of disadvantage scheme which was introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of anv additional initiatives being taken to address educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I formally established a National Educational Psychological Service Agency on 1 September last with the objective of providing a new psychological service to all schools over a period of five years. Additional psychologists are being recruited for this service at present. The needs of schools in all areas. including the Finglas area, will be addressed as part of this development.</P>

      <P>Bus Éireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department and is responsible for the safe conditions of the vehicles in use.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. All school transport vehicles, whether operated by Bus Éireann or private contractors on behalf of Bus Éireann, are required to pass annually a Department of the Environment roadworthiness test and therefore comply with the necessary European public service vehicle standards. These vehicles are also subjected to additional regular inspection to ensure that their reliability is maintained throughout the school year.</P>
      <P>Vehicles engaged in school transport generally operate in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 miles per annum based on working over a 38 week school year. Work involving such low utilisation of vehicles is generally most appropriate to well maintained second-hand vehicles. Bus Éireann continues to implement a programme of introduction of good quality second hand buses to the school transport fleet. This ensures that the overall standard of vehicles is constantly improving.</P>
      <P>Contracts for the operation of the school transport services are negotiated between Bus Éireann and the individual contractors and renewed annually. This year all contracts were successfully negotiated and filled and a reasonable rate of pay was offered for the current school year. I am aware that there has been no increase in the rates of payment to contractors since September 1994. However, there are no additional resources available at present to make improvements in this area.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the pupils concerned mainly reside in the Grange, County Sligo school catchment area and are eligible for catchment boundary transport only to the Bundoran and Ballyshannon post primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one, Grange in this case, may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended. This is subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service <Col N="271" /> and provided that no additional State cost is incurred. The pupils in question are facilitated with catchment boundary transport on a public schedule service subject to the above conditions. I understand that while the bus is crowded it is operating within its legal carrying capacity.</P>
    <P>It is not open to my Department to put on a special bus service to cater for pupils who are entitled to catchment boundary transport only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I share his concern at the levels of non-school attendance in many areas of the country. It is for this reason that I have initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education Welfare Bill which I recently published will provide for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service. The legislation includes specific measures for an effective &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; system so as to ensure that children who are at risk of dropping out of the system can be identified and early interventions put in place. Among the key objectives of the Bill is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility for school attendance on a country-wide basis. Education welfare officers employed <Col N="272" /> by the authority will co-ordinate State services to children who have school attendance problems.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative which was introduced in September 1998 is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
    <P>In addition, I recently announced a major initiative aimed at increasing the number of pupils remaining in school to complete the leaving certificate. This stay in school initiative will provide funding to targeted post primary schools on the basis of plans which the schools will be helped to design. The intention is to empower the schools to tackle their own early school leaving problems. At the core of the initiative will be a multi-annual retention plan drawn up between the school and my Department. This will provide for a range of targeted measures directed at the particular needs of the individual school, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention. A key requirement of the plans will be that the school operates on a multi-agency basis and establishes cross community links in delivering on its commitments.</P>
    <P>At present my Department is making the necessary arrangements to administer this initiative. I expect that the operation of the stay in school initiative will commence very shortly. I am satisfied that the initiatives which I have outlined will have an important impact on the problem of early school leaving in all areas, including the midlands.</P>

      <P>Promoting an inclusive society where social harmony, sustained employment and industrial competitiveness are maintained and enhanced, demands an approach where educational policies are central and are designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to provide a system where education, training and business interests work in partnership to ensure the highest standards of quality and relevance in line with best national and international practice and where the system responds effectively and quickly to emerging needs.</P>
      <P>Second level curricular reforms have been introduced under the LCA and LCVP programmes to strengthen the enterprise, vocational, technical and language dimension of senior cycle programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of these new programmes has been accompanied by the development of links between schools and industry such as the IBEC <Col N="278" /> Business Education Links Programme, which commenced in 1995. The initiative enables schools and industry to work together at local level. There are approximately 100 schools involved in the programme involving over 3,000 students. The IBEC Business Education Links Programme provides for a mix of any or all of the following: participation of students on company induction programmes; focused business visits; mini-enterprise support; demonstrations showing how learning in the school is applicable in the workplace and in-company placement for teachers.</P>
    <P>In the LCVP programme students follow a full leaving certificate programme that includes two subjects in related technical-vocational disciplines, allied with a continental language, new technology and three link modules entitled &lsquo;Enterprise Education' Preparation for work and Work Experience'. LCVP schools participate in the IBEC Business Education Links Programme. The support service for the LCVP programme issue a Journal on a regular basis to schools which include inputs from industry.</P>
    <P>The revised syllabus for leaving certificate business places a great deal of emphasis on the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills. Many schools integrate into their teaching of the revised syllabus <i>The Irish Times</i>&ldquo;Business 2000&rdquo;, which <Col N="279" /> features case studies of leading Irish companies. Visits to the companies by pupils and visits by the companies to schools often form part of this programme.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Enterprise Encounter&rdquo; is a resource devised by teachers for teachers of Transition Year pupils. It will also serve the needs of LCVP &ndash; leaving certificate vocational programme &ndash; and leaving certificate applied pupils.

    <P>Mini-companies, a form of work simulation, are part of most transition year programmes. They introduce students to the realities of the work-place in a safe environment. Some of the products of these companies are viable, a fact commented on by visitors to the mini-company trade fairs, a number of which are held every year.</P>
    <P>The Business and Education Links Programme, established by IBEC, aims to help pupils to appreciate the world of business and contributes to the development of pupils' work skills by means of classroom talks, company visits and linked activities. Opportunities are also offered to teachers to spend time on placement within the company. A survey carried out on this programme showed that by the end of 1997, 84 link activities had taken place involving 21 companies, 42 schools and 1,583 students. Just under half the students involved were in transition year. The survey showed that 61 per cent of students involved were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the experience, and 25 per cent &ldquo;moderately satisfied&rdquo;. 81 per cent of the companies which took part in the survey said they were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo;, while 14 per cent were &ldquo;moderately satisfied&rdquo;. Among the teachers, 57 per cent declared themselves &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; and 29 per cent &ldquo;moderately satisfied&rdquo;. IBEC is expanding this programme from year to year. There are currently 120 companies and 200 schools involved.</P>

      <Col N="280" /> In regard to third level a joint initiative was recently launched involving the universities and IBEC in association with the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Science on foot of the recommendation of the expert group on future skills needs. Some 1,500 postgraduate places in 1999/2000 are being provided in the universities on courses at this level aimed at meeting skills need in the ICT area at a cost of £6 million. A key element in the scheme will be the inclusion of recruitment opportunities for graduates through a number of initiatives to be co-ordinated on behalf of industry by IBEC. A dedicated website, a recruitment fair and open days with industry will be provided to facilitate students.</P>
    <P>At institutional level, the Universities Act, 1997, sets out the objects of a university to include the advancement of knowledge, the promotion of learning and of national economic and social development, the education and ongoing training of higher level professional, technical and managerial personnel. The promotion and facilitation of research and collaboration with business interests are functions of a university. Business interests are represented on the governing authorities of institutions. Under the Universities Act, 1997, all universities must have at least two members who are nominated by organisations which are representative of business and industry.</P>
    <P>Similarly, institutes of technology are required by legislation to provide education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State with particular reference to the regions served by the institutes. The institutes have close links with economic life and the enterprise sector as part of their central mission. There is continuous industry involvement with the institutes in the process of course validation and with programmatic and institutional review. Industrial and sectoral needs are fully taken into account by the institutes and there is extensive consultation at course and curriculum design stages. Industry and professional bodies are represented on the governing bodies of the institutes to reflect the range of sectoral groups and agencies and the particular industrial focus in the region served.</P>
