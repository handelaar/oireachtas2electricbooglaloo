      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. a7, motion re Revised Estimates for Public Services; No. b7, Finance Bill, 1999, Financial Resolution; No. 33, Finance Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 3, The British-Irish Agreement Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There are six proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with item No. a7 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with item No. b7 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 33 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 3 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the Adjournment of the Dáil on Thursday agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil resumes on 23 March, as we have just agreed, will provision be made for a debate on the measures announced to deal with the housing crisis? In particular, will that debate be extended to include the public transport implications of these plans in view of the fact that if new houses are to be built there <Col N="3" /> must be bus and train services for them? Clearly, this cannot be financed solely on the basis of borrowing by CIE. If there is a national housing emergency there is also a national transport emergency and they must be dealt with together. Will the Taoiseach agree to a debate on housing and its public transport implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to that. I suggest that we should have such a debate after 25 March, on which date the strategic planning guidelines will be published. If we can take the debate immediately after that we could include all the aspects, including transport, housing, strategic planning and the density report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to disagree with the Taoiseach's proposal which goes a good distance towards what I want, but the strategic planning guidelines, to which he referred, only relate to Dublin, they do not relate to the whole country. Clearly there is a housing, traffic and public transport crisis in the whole country. Will the Government table its views on the public transport, traffic and housing problems as they affect the whole territory of the State, not just the Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic planning guidelines are a very important aspect of the whole problem. As Deputy Bruton knows, the problem is a nationwide one but it is far more acute in Dublin. The difficulty is to try to get the supply in the greater Dublin area up and running. The Government will be glad to debate in the House the Bacon proposals on affordable housing, the density proposals and the transport proposals that have been published in the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of promised legislation, is the Taoiseach aware that the legislation to establish the human rights commission, which he makes fulsome reference to in today's edition of<i> The Irish Times</i> article, has not yet been discussed by the relevant committee of this House? Is he aware the heads of the Bill were not sent directly to the committee by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but instead were laid in the Library of the House and the secretary of the committee had to request them. The chairman of the committee has not yet scheduled a discussion on them and the heads of the draft legislation have not yet been circulated to members of the committee. As I speak, there are no proposals for this matter to be dealt with. Since the Taoiseach is responsible for promised legislation and its introduction in this House through whatever Department has responsibility, what precise steps will he take to ensure this matter is advanced so that the assertion in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>correlates with the truth, which is not the case at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on a number of <Col N="4" /> occasions in the House, as soon as the heads of that Bill are ready they should be debated by the committee. That is my intention and that is what should happen. As far as I am concerned, these matters are to be debated within the two relevant committees, which I promised some weeks ago to Deputy McManus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the Taoiseach's goodwill in this respect, but I have to challenge his competence in pursuing the matter. The responsible Department did not communicate with the committee in question. The secretary of the committee had to seek the heads of the Bill. We are not talking about draft legislation at this stage but the heads of the Bill, its early stages. The Bill specifically excludes mention of the European Convention on Human Rights. As far as I know, the Taoiseach does not appear to have contacted the chairman who is responsible for ordering the business of that committee. Either the Government is serious, in accordance with what the Taoiseach said here yesterday, about moving all the measures over which we have control to advance the Good Friday Agreement or it is not. This is a classic example.</P>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that the counterpart body in Northern Ireland has now been established and is operational. We have yet to discuss the heads of a Bill for draft legislation. It appears the Government is not serious about moving on the areas in which we have exclusive control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to establishing a human rights commission and to examining the question of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights. I stated on 17 February last before the two committees, Justice, Equality and Women's' Rights and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, that the heads of the Bill were available. I will inquire as to what happened but as far as I was concerned they were available for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A very brief question, please. We cannot deal much more with it on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. This afternoon we will take Committee Stage of a major Bill. The Taoiseach does not seem to know what is happening inside his Government. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How many members of that committee in the backbenches are aware that these items have not yet been discussed?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government controls the committee. Will the Taoiseach meet the chairman of the committee and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform and ensure this matter is scheduled as an item of priority and that it will be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in doing that. Deputy Quinn is not asking me to move the heads away from the Government and to regulate the work of the committees. There are about 20 committees and I will not do that. I promised Deputy McManus many months ago that I would get these heads cleared and would ask the committees to deal with them and I have done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that did not happen? The Minister just laid them in the Oireachtas Library. He has not done the job the Taoiseach asked him to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the committees have not done it but I will ask the chairman and the committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear the Michael McDowell group, the group examining how well companies comply with company law, has now reported to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on company compliance. Is new legislation recommended in that report? Nobody here has seen the report but we may read about it in the newspapers. Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation to establish a companies regulator supremo as a result of that report? When will we see the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the report will be published next week. The company (No. 2) Bill is due in April and a companies (amendment) Bill will be ready early this year, I hope in the next month or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

Among those measures to be brought forward is a new statutory offence specifically targeted at intimidation of witnesses with a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment. That will be <Col N="7" /> brought forward in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>

        <b>:</b> When I asked the Taoiseach last week for a debate on the question of genetic engineering of crops and vegetables and its effect on the environment and possible health effects, he said it would take place this week, but it is not in the schedule. When will that debate be rescheduled?</P>

    <P>Against a background of chronic and escalating exploitation by rackrenting landlords and the naked displays of greed in the private rented sector, when will legislation be brought forward to control rents and give security of tenure to those in private rented accommodation?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
      <P Just="Center">Taxation Policy</P>
      <P>1.&ndash;(1) The Minister for Finance shall on the 30th day of October, 1999, and not less frequently than each fifth anniversary thereof, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a White Paper on the development of taxation policy.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister for Finance shall invite submissions from interested parties, not later than the 1st day of April in each year, in which such a White Paper is prepared. Such invitation, which shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, shall be accompanied by a listing of those areas of taxation policy, which the Minister considers should be addressed in the White Paper.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> We discussed this on Committee Stage but I thought it was worth resubmitting it so that we could discuss it again. The Minister has signalled major changes to the tax code and the ramifications of some of those changes are not clear.</P>
    <P>In the budget he announced that, from now on, personal allowances would only be available at the standard rate but there are a range of other allowances. On behalf of the Government he said we were moving away from an allowances system to a tax credits system. This should be dealt with in a White Paper so that people could clearly see the ramifications of a move to tax credits.</P>
    <P>There are also implications arising from the agreement in Brussels that the standard rate of corporation tax will be 12.5 per cent. I raised with the Minister the question of how surpluses would be distributed. Although he has signalled the schedule of change and the increments by which he will reduce the rate after this Finance Bill from 28 per cent to 12.5 per cent, the full implications for certain companies are still not clear. We have discovered that mining will be treated as if it were not a trading activity and a 25 per cent rate of corporation tax will apply to it, although quarrying will be taxed at 12.5 per cent. We need further information in that area also. Again, a White Paper would be the appropriate vehicle to flag the way forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the Finance Bill represents the commencement of a new approach to pensions. For the purposes of debate, it would be of assistance if he indicated his intentions in detail by way of a White Paper. The Minister will be aware that the proposals he announced on budget day, which he implemented by way of amendments on Committee Stage, have caused a great deal of debate, some of which has been ill informed. The fact that professional advisers have only had since last Monday to come to terms with the changes proposed by the Minister is one of the difficulties. If, as stated on Committee Stage, the Minister intends this to be the first instalment of a total reform of the manner in which pensions are funded, and given his indication that he also intends to make changes in occupational pensions, there is a necessity to flag this in advance and to set out the main proposals by way of a White Paper to allow a public debate before legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>The other area in respect of which a fruitful discussion could take place involves the appropriateness or otherwise of granting additional powers to the Revenue. The Minister may not be able to indicate his overall position by October because it does not seem the tribunals will have reported at that stage. However, this is another area where an overview is necessary.</P>
    <P>There are five obvious areas where it would facilitate debate and inform the public and Members in a more satisfactory way if the Minister committed himself to the publication of a White Paper. The first part of the amendment <Col N="12" /> suggests that on this occasion it should be done by 30 October 1999, but the second part proposes the Minister for Finance and his successors would be obliged, following consultation, to bring forward a White Paper every five years to update the public on the latest thinking on tax changes intended within the Department of Finance or by the Minister. That is the basis of this proposal.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for forwarding to me the papers from the taxation review group which have been helpful. I am aware he intends this as a compromise to producing a White Paper to better inform the public. I understand the papers are being placed in the Oireachtas Library and I presume they will be made generally available. I do not know if they are available on disk, but the cover note accompanying them suggests they will be made available on the Internet on the Department of Finance's web page. If they were made available on disk they would be of benefit to the professions, but I presume interested parties will be able to download them from the Department's website.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for this major advance in providing information to everyone in respect of current thinking in the Department of Finance, which moves a considerable distance towards meeting the requirements set out in the amendment. However, the Minister should reconsider the position because there is nothing to fear from sharing the maximum amount of information with the public or with Members of this House. In my opinion there is an obligation to do so at a time when the Minister is signalling major changes across a range of taxation issues and when he is raising the expectations of change but not supplying the relevant information to the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides the opportunity for a short debate on how we plan ahead and the level of economic debate in which we engage. I join Deputy Noonan in thanking the Minister for publishing the tax strategy group's reports. I have not had an opportunity to consider them carefully because I received them only this morning. I have no intention of carping, but at a glance they seem to be somewhat different in tone from previous TSG reports. I wonder if this is informed to some degree by a paper which appears close to the start of the folder indicating that the reports are accessible under the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps that has informed the way the reports are drawn up because they are far slower than previous reports to identify who held a particular view. I suppose that is one of the downsides of openness. However, I welcome the publication of the reports because they will be useful in stimulating debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the primary element of last year's budget, namely, the partial shift to tax credits, scarcely features in the reports. There is one discussion on this in the summary of the Partnership 2000 working group's report. However, beyond that there is almost no reference to the <Col N="13" /> major element of last year's budget. It might be fair to state that perhaps the Minister relies rather less than his predecessors on TSG reports and discussions. If I can anticipate his response, I do not doubt that the Minister will make a virtue of that, rather than considering it to be a criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might be. Today's debate will be interesting because the Minister had a late in the day Pauline conversion to political correctness on Committee Stage and he was proud to inform us of that. Perhaps during this debate we will be able to test the mettle of that assertion.</P>
      <P>To return to the serious issue of multi-annual budgeting and planning, we appear to be in a position where we can meaningfully plan for the next five to ten years on the basis of a moderate level of growth, namely, 4 per cent to 5 per cent. It is sad that there has been a dearth of discussion and debate about how this can be achieved. Part of that results from the size of the country and the number of bodies, institutes and advisory groups in place to provide the debate that is needed. Also, political thought in this area has tended to clutter around the centre.</P>
      <P>An important element of this issue involves the role of Government. We have made some effort to project into the medium term and since budget day I have made an effort to generate debate about the stability and convergence programmes we have submitted to the European Commission. It is interesting and remarkable that, even to debate this issue, we have been obliged to base our discussions on reports and projections we have been required to submit to the Commission. The notion of medium-term thought or projecting ahead by three to four years is foreign to us. This stands in notable contrast to the budget introduced yesterday by Chancellor Gordon Brown in Britain which set out a programme for two to three years. That is something we have been reluctant to do and it partly reflects the decision making process which obtains in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not know when the decision was taken to introduce tax credits. However, I will wager it was taken late in the day and that the Minister has not been planning the conversion to tax credits since taking office. There is a lack of planning, coherence and predictability about the way we deal with the taxation system, which is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Minister is indulging in significant openness in terms of publishing the tax strategy group's reports, I suggest that, in terms of medium-term projections and planning, openness is also required in respect of the national plan. A number of weeks ago the <i>Irish Independent</i> leaked, if that is the correct word, an ESRI report which will form the basis of the advice to the Government in respect of the plan. It would be useful if a statement of the Government's current <Col N="14" /> thinking were circulated, perhaps to the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service, for discussion rather than waiting until the plan is produced in completed form. A much more extensive public debate than was previously entered into is needed on these issues. I take it that is the intention behind the amendment.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in making medium-term projections if we are not in some way bound by those projections and the plans we set out. As stated previously, the multi-annual budgetary strategy will work only if it is credible. It will be credible only if people believe the Government is committed to delivering on the targets included in the multi-annual budgetary strategy. Given that there has been no debate on the Estimates &ndash; the Minister does not refer to them as financial envelopes but they appear to me to be exactly that &ndash; since they were published last December, it would be easy for the Minister and the Government to simply walk away from them.</P>
    <P>There is a need to debate the way the Estimates are formulated. It is interesting that the Minister has published the TSG report today. I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act in respect of Estimates debates within particular Departments. Some of the responses bordered on the hysterical. There was a lack of comprehension that they were being asked to indicate their spending priorities and negotiating position with the Department of Finance. It was almost as if munitions had been used in part of the war, had not worked in the particular year and were being banked for the following year. The notion that there could be public debate on whether this was a good way to spend money appeared to be anathema to those responding to the requests. That is typical of the way business has been done over many decades.</P>
    <P>While reductions in taxation and increases in excise duties always attract attention on budget day, the most important decisions are those relating to spending which are still made in private and attract little attention unless there is a particular issue, for example, health spending, which is the subject of controversy. I endorse the general thrust of the amendment. There is a need for more openness and debate. The Government has to be central in pushing this forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be more debate prior to publication of the Finance Bill. This would be good practice and would be of help to the Minister. In the correspondence every Deputy has received from the Institute of Taxation, it reiterates that there is genuine concern among compliant taxpayers who have always paid their way about the extraordinary powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners despite the assurances given by the Minister on Committee Stage. The institute has received the advice of senior counsel on the constitutionality of the proposed provisions. They have identified ten areas where they are probably unconstitutional. If the matter had been discussed beforehand with the <Col N="15" /> institute, the Minister would probably be able to tell us with certainty that there are no constitutional difficulties with the proposed provisions.</P>
      <P>The approach suggested by Deputy Noonan of a White Paper should be considered. In this way any grey areas can be identified and teased out. The proposed provisions appear to be a kneejerk reaction to the tribunals to send a signal to the public that the Government is acting to curb tax evasion. Measures as extreme as this should be discussed beforehand. If the approach suggested by Deputy Noonan was adopted, the consequences of major change, not just in this area but in the area of pensions and so on, would be discussed beforehand. The public and general practitioners can find loopholes and weaknesses in the laws that we make and think are perfect. While the motor industry lobby group is effective, a discussion of implications of the proposed changes in VRT would have been helpful prior to their announcement in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Noonan and Deenihan want to write into the law a compulsory provision which would oblige every Minister for Finance to prepare a White Paper on selected areas of tax policy at five year intervals, starting in October 1999. The proposed amendment would also require invitations to be issued for public comment on a list of taxation topics specified by the Minister by 1 April in the year in which the White Paper is to be produced. The amendment appears to envisage a grant strategy on tax policy being announced following public consultation every five years.</P>
      <P>This issue was the subject of a comprehensive debate on Committee Stage last week. I fully agree that the more information there is in the public domain on issues surrounding tax policy the better should be the formulation of that policy. I share the Deputies' views on the importance of a stable and predictable tax system where businesses know as far as possible in advance what the Government has in store for them by way of future tax changes. I do not agree, however, that the proposed amendment is the best or only way to secure these aims.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to tax policy is set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium on which it was elected. As I said in my first budget and repeated in my second in December, I intend to deliver over the five budgets of the Government the tax proposals agreed in An Action Programme for the Millennium. There is not, therefore, as appears to be implied by the amendment, great uncertainty about the future of the Government's tax reform programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many of the areas cited by Deputy Noonan as suitable for a White Paper there has been considerable debate inside and outside the House. There is the question of child care on which the Government recently published the Partnership 2000 working group report. As I said on Committee Stage, there is one initiative which may be <Col N="16" /> worth while and which could be undertaken around this time each year, that is, to publish the relevant papers of the tax strategy group which cover all aspects of income tax, corporation tax, capital tax, indirect tax, environmental and other tax policies. They not only set out a general statement of the goals and objectives in particular tax areas and the options available to secure them but also give an insight into the dynamics of how policy is arrived at. If there are areas of tax policy on which Members would welcome a briefing from time to time or in respect of which the appropriate committee would wish to invite a submission, I would be anxious to facilitate such requests. I have given the Deputy a copy of these papers. As indicated on Committee Stage, it has been necessary to hold back a small amount of material. I am placing copies of the papers in the Oireachtas Library and will be publishing them on my Department's website on the Internet.</P>
    <P>While these proposals should assist the Deputies and underline official thinking in these areas, tax changes are a matter for the Government. They are for the people to decide in elections and through that method the Government. If the people like what the Government parties are putting forward in taxation measures, they will vote for those parties. If not, they will vote for somebody else and adopt their tax policies. That is the ultimate basis for all tax changes &ndash; they come from the people who give power to the elected Government.</P>
    <P>Various tax changes have been raised. It has been suggested that there was inadequate consultation and that there should be a White Paper leading to a grand strategy. It is useful to have wideranging consultation on topics due to come before the Government for decision &ndash; the consensus approach. This used to take the form of observations from Government Departments which were incorporated in a memorandum to the Government which ultimately made a decision on the matter. That type of approach has been developed in the past decade with the very successful partnership mechanism to agreeing wages and other matters in the national programmes by employers, Government, trade unions and the farmers.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe this is the only way for Ministers for Finance or any other Minister to make decisions. On the debate on last year's Finance Bill, Deputy McDowell pushed for changes to the capital gains tax as if to imply that unless a lobby group seeks changes in a specific area the job of the Minister is to do whatever his Department officials tell him and to respond likewise to other groups. That may be the way a number of Ministers, perhaps of all Governments, have operated and perhaps it is the way some would like them to operate in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not hold that view on the role of a Minister, indeed it is no secret that I am strongly against it. In this regard, I was heartened to hear remarks, which did not get much publicity, by a former Minister of the Fine Gael Party when <Col N="17" /> called as a witness in court proceedings last year which, <i>inter alia,</i> dealt with telecommunication changes. When it was put to him that a decision he had taken was not what his officials had recommended he replied he was proud to have done the opposite. He was right. A former official in my Department who is well known recently spoke to me of a certain matter many years ago which officials in the Department had opposed. He went on to say that, as usual, they were wrong.</P>
    <P>I recently referred to the tyranny of consensus as an approach to dealing with matters as if it is the role of Ministers merely to reflect the views of lobby groups and others and put them into effect or to debate matters for weeks, months and years before arriving at a consensus which is then implemented. While that can be effective in some areas, in many others it is a recipe for making no decision or making one which is an amalgam of the lowest common denominator of all the different opposing groups.</P>
    <P>If I had taken that approach many measures I have taken would not have been introduced. For example, had I waited to achieve a consensus on tax credits they would not have been introduced in this budget, nor in any foreseeable one. Similarly with my proposals on pensions and the betting tax. Nor did my officials recommend the changes I introduced to the capital gains tax last year. However, decisions such as these are political, to be taken by the Minster and Government of the day. If one looks at the decisions I have taken as Minister it will be apparent that in many respects I did not wait for consensus, nor do I intend to.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies and others hold the view that the only way to proceed is by reflecting the views of one group or another. While I am probably in a minority in the House on this issue, I do not subscribe to that method of decision-making and there is no point in people fooling themselves otherwise. They will have to put up with my way of operating for my period in office. It must be borne in mind that people can decide on taxation changes at the ballot box.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to multi-annual budgeting. Recently he has been building a dossier of replies to parliamentary questions in an attempt to plan forward. He is right to say it leads to good government and budgetary planning to plan expenditure and taxation changes for the future. I am committed to the multi-annual budgeting approach on the spending side and in my Budget Statement I said I would develop it further this year.</P>
    <P>At present, no policy change projections are made. This year I have also indicated the total financial envelopes for coming years on the spending side. The next logical step is to break that down on a departmental basis, whereby each Department will have a financial envelope from which they will decide their priorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the traditional approach to the budgetary process, where Departments keep returning to Ministers for Fin<Col N="18" /> ance with their agendas and priorities until they are implemented. Under the new approach they will be advised of their total financial allocation for three years which they can then work on. This process will take time and new ways of thinking will have to evolve in Departments to ensure its success, similar to what happens in private business. It is a more logical approach to the spending side.</P>
    <P>The commitment to a cash limit in the programme for Government, developed by me when in Opposition, is effective in this approach. Deputy McDowell has argued against the 4 per cent spending limit and has questioned the way it is defined and implemented. However, it is a good thing, at least for planning purposes because it is an exact sum. It enables precise amounts to be calculated forwards, which is a more exact science than the previous methods, calculated on the basis of growth in the economy plus inflation. While my method may be crude it is effective because it can be worked forward and it lends itself to this type of approach. Agreeing with the concept is a separate matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also referred to the recently leaked document produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute regarding what should be included in the next national development plan. The document will be published formally in the coming week. It would be a good idea for the Committee on Finance and the Public Service to make a contribution to the next plan because I do not want it merely to consist of what official agencies or Departments want. Politicians on all sides should have an opportunity to have their priorities included as well. The timetable for that must be assessed by the chairperson of the committee.</P>
    <P>If agreement is reached at the end of this month when the Heads of State and Government meet on the Agenda 2000 package and the regulations are put in place, the Government will have three months to produce and submit its national development plan. If everything goes according to the German plan, that should happen by the end of June. I have no objection to the committee making its contribution. When the ESRI document is published in the next week or two, it might form the basis for developments in the committee. I will relay those views to my Department because we would like to assist in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and Deputy Deenihan, whose idea it is to have a grand strategy, have raised questions about the various tax heads, such as corporation tax, gift tax, pensions, powers to the Revenue, etc. An Action Programme for the Millennium sets out some of these taxation matters. The Minister for Finance and the Government of the day decide in the context of each budget on the appropriate ways forward in this area. I intend to continue with that method. As I said earlier, a grand strategy in these areas is not the best way forward. Taxation policy is a matter for the Government of the day on foot of electoral decisions made by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for what he said about the national plan. It is useful that we should have a discussion before the Government signs off on it.</P>
      <P>What the Minister said about the decision-making process is interesting and instructive and I do not disagree with most of it. It is fine for a Minister to seek advice, reject it and do what he wants. However, it is different when he comes into the House and says he was advised by the Department not to do what he is doing in terms of pensions or it opposes what he is doing in terms of capital gains tax. I do not have a problem with the Minister rejecting advice, but he is making a distinction between himself and his Department.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the notion that there is a corporate view in any Department about anything. Individuals in a Department who deal with a particular issue have views and I have no difficulty with the identity of those individuals being known or their accounting for those views, in so far as is necessary, to committees of the House. However, I have a problem when a Department produces a huge amount of material, such as the stability programme, the convergence programme, the structural reform programme and the national plan and has an input into the credit union working group and the Pensions Board report and then the Minister says that is not his view. If it is not the Minister's view, that should be clear upfront or he should ensure the stability programme reflects his view.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not have time to deal with all issues. The result of the decision-making process the Minister described is that a lot of material is produced by his Department which he then feels at liberty to disown. The stability programme, for example, commits the Minister to a tax reduction programme of £350 million over the next three years. Is that his view? </P>

      <P>The Deputy asked a specific question about the stability programme. The sum of £350 million is an indicative figure for the tax reductions during the years of the stability programme. It does not bind the Government to a figure greater or less than that amount. That figure was included to produce the stability programme.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but it was inadequate. He uses the phrase &ldquo;grand strategy&rdquo; as a pejorative term as if we were suggesting anything more than would be prudent to plan the affairs of the nation properly, including planning taxation matters. We have a great opportunity going into the next decade but we also have an opportunity to wreck the country with all the problems of growth. Any reflection on what is proposed in the Bacon report, which was received by Deputies this morning, would indicate that it can go in one of two directions.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest flaws in public administration is the lack of medium and long-term planning across a range of activities. Pressure from the European Central Bank and the European Commission means we must plan ahead for expenditure. Deputy Quinn, when Minister for Finance, introduced multi-annual budgeting which has been taken a step further by the Stability and Growth Pact. We must now indicate to Europe our intentions for the next three years. While it is hard on the expenditure side, it is light on the taxation side. It would be prudent to plan ahead for tax as well.</P>
      <P>I met someone recently who had listened to Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and said they did not know anything more about the Bill afterwards but knew a lot about the Minister. I hope we do not go through Report Stage with a series of night light sermons mixed with autobiographical detail from the Minister. He should address the issues.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response was inadequate. It is not true that the Government's taxation policy is set out in the programme for Government. What the Minister did in his first budget in terms of income tax and the distributive effects of reliefs, he completely reversed in his second budget. It is clear from the papers we received last night and this morning that there was no real intention of moving towards tax credits in the discussions of the tax strategy group prior to Christmas. A political decision was taken prior to the budget, which I presume was driven by the Progressive Democrats. It was clear from replies to two parliamentary questions tabled to the Minister before Christmas that he was a lukewarm participant in the tax credit idea. He has not driven the tax credit agenda forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Administration of the day decide tax policy. However, it would be a relief to the populace if views on taxation policy, as on many other matters, were not made up as we go along and if there was a tax strategy which spanned a number of years. Most of the problems in this country are due to the fact there is no medium-term strategy about anything and people are racing hard to catch up. This is an opportunity to allow the Minister to deal with issues with which he has not dealt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major taxation issues we must face is green taxes, which will be driven by Europe. What is the Government's position on green taxes? A discussion paper on that alone would be <Col N="21" /> of benefit. We know the tax strategy group has certain views on it but is there any policy view on green taxes? </P>
    <P>The Minister has not met my proposal. He has made a series of political points with which no one fundamentally disagrees, but he has not addressed the issue. He wants to reserve the right to make it up as he goes along. The Minister headed off in one direction in his first budget but reversed that in his second budget. He has now taken a number of initiatives. The Minister prides himself on taking a separate stance from the advice he gets from his Department. It has never been the tradition in this House for Ministers to distinguish between themselves and their Department on policy issues. It has never been the practice for Ministers to say in this House that their officials wanted them to do the opposite but they did not go along with them. That is not the way to run the shop.</P>
    <P>The type of debate the Minister has with his officials should be internal to the Department of Finance. The Minister should come out with Government policy, having been advised by his officials, and not take the macho approach where he appears to be saying that he is in touch with the ordinary people while his officials are not, that this is a very good proposal and that he rejected the advice he was given. The Minister should not proceed along those lines. If he believes that, he should keep those views to himself. The policies that emerge are Government policies proposed by the Minister and I have no doubt they have the support of his officials. We do not know where the Minister is going in the pension area, tax credits or green taxes and in this, as in other matters, it would be a good idea for the Minister to start planning forward.</P>
    <P>Some light should be shed on the whole question of reliefs, particularly with the difficulties being experienced in Brussels over urban and rural reliefs in terms of double rent allowances and rates relief. For the past 20 years various lobby groups have put forward a series of schemes to different Ministers to turn income into assets. If one has money in this country the name of the game is to turn income into assets by not paying tax. That ranges across the whole area of relief, and there are some creative people who always have a new scheme to turn another tranche of income into an asset by not paying tax. The strategy on this whole area must be laid out in full.</P>
    <P>The Minister made remarks in his first budget which indicated that he intended to trim most allowances out of the system and go for a lower tax regime overall. I do not know whether that remains his position. Whatever the mechanism, there is a serious gap in the manner in which the Minister does business. We must have an overview of certain heads of taxation, either by way of a White Paper or otherwise, and the Minister should attempt to project forward at least to the end of this Administration. I put this down for <Col N="22" /> debating purposes only. I do not intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 28, to delete &ldquo;£8,200&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£9,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy discussion on this and the other tax related amendments on Committee Stage and we would not be using our time well if we repeat too much of that. This amendment deals with exemption limits. The Minister pointed out in his response on Committee Stage that the number of people on marginal relief has diminished considerably and, to that extent, the aim of TWIG is largely being met. I tabled the amendment because I wanted to ask the Minister, in light of the imminent introduction of a national minimum wage, if we should seek to marry the exemption limit with the national minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment by Deputy McDowell proposes to increase the general exemption limit to £4,500 for a single person and £9,000 for a married couple. The current exemption limit is £4,100 for a single person and £8,200 for a married couple. The cost of the amendment would be £1.6 million in 1999 and £3.9 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in response to a similar amendment on Committee Stage, I did not increase the general exemptions this year arising out of the recommendations of the Tax and Welfare Integration Group, TWIG, report some years ago. The TWIG report examined in some detail the exemption system and its associated marginal relief. While recognising that the system had both advantages and disadvantages, it felt that the disadvantages outweighed the cost efficiency /targeting advantages the system had to offer. In particular, it referred to the application of a high marginal rate of tax to low incomes in the context of employment incentives. It concluded that displacement of the marginal relief system by the normal tax system is a desirable objective in terms of its impact on incentives, reduction in costs of employing people within the marginal relief range of incomes and the ending of a progressive encroachment of a second tax system on the ordinary tax system. These comments would have more relevance to the general exemption limits as opposed to the age related limits for those aged 65 years or over which I have substantially increased in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial increases in personal allowances are provided in the Bill. These ensure that a single person on PAYE will pay no tax on income below £100 per week &ndash; this contrasts very favourably with the exemption limit of less than £87 per week as envisaged by the amendment. <Col N="23" /> The number of people on marginal relief has fallen dramatically as a result of the budget changes. The numbers have fallen from 81,495, or 6 per cent of taxpayers, to 24,400, or 2.2 per cent of taxpayers. For these reasons, I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me a separate question on raising the exemption limits to the level of the national minimum wage. In this year's budget I moved substantially to a system of tax credits and in future budgets I will complete the changeover to the tax credits system in its entirety. The allowances method referred to by the Deputy is more or less redundant in that context. The proposed national minimum wage is £4.40 per hour and in a 40 hour week that is a fairly sizeable sum. There is no intention to have an exemption limit in next year's budget of that magnitude for a single person. The changeover to the tax credits system will allow the Minister for Finance to focus more clearly on any direction he desires at that time. This is now accepted as the fairest way to approach these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from a point made by Deputy McDowell, is it the Minister's intention that the minimum wage, when it is introduced, will be taxed or is it the policy position that exemptions or credits will be increased sufficiently to ensure the minimum wage is tax free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not make the mistake of mixing up two different concepts. The issue of a national minimum wage is being decided upon by the Government and taxation matters are a separate issue. We should not attempt to engage the two together. It would be the intention of the Government, over a period of years, to eliminate as many people on low incomes as possible from the taxation net, subject to the overall requirement of the public finances and the Government's intention on taxation changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this. The Minister disavows his Department &ndash; perhaps I should distance myself from my party a little on this one. Most people should contribute by way of taxation or PRSI to the running of the State. To that extent I am not in favour of exemption limits. In many cases the contribution might be slight but as a principle it is a good one. We need a certain predictability in assessing the value of the minimum wage. People must know what the impact of taxation will be on that. This is doubtless an issue that will come up over the remainder of the year when the negotiations on the successor to Partnership 2000 are taking place. It would be useful &ndash; that is the reason I tabled the amendment &ndash; if the Minister would indicate how he sees the taxation treatment of the minimum wage progressing over future years, because that will <Col N="24" /> help him progress in those negotiations. I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 15, to delete &ldquo;£14,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£15,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the budget the Minister increased the application of the standard rate band by a small amount. In the case of single people, only £50 extra of earned income per annum can be taxed at the standard rate. Afterwards, the 46 per cent marginal rate is applied. At present, about 45 per cent of all taxpayers pay tax at the higher rate. In an overview of taxation and how it impacts on the labour force it is clear the application of the higher level of income tax on such low levels of income, particularly for single people, is a major disincentive.</P>
      <P>One of the pressures developing in the economy is the lack of skilled labour. In certain areas the skills required have dried up. Throughout the economy vacancies are not being filled. They can only be filled from three or four areas. For the first time in a long time there are sufficient employment places for school and college leavers in the labour market. Additional workers can also be secured by moving people from welfare to work. A significant amount has been done in that regard. The higher exemption limits in the budget will be of further assistance, particularly the fact that the first £100 of income is tax free. It will be of great benefit in moving more groups of people from welfare to work.</P>
      <P>If women are to be attracted to return to the labour force, the 46 per cent rate will be a key factor. There is also the issue of child care and the availability of crèches and child minders, which we discussed previously. I am disappointed the Minister and the Government, who have received a report on this subject, have not acted on it but kicked it to touch again. However, the combination of those issues will decide whether the participation of women in the workforce will reach the European average over the next few years.</P>
      <P>If it does not, the predictions of continuing growth at 5 per cent or 6 per cent over the decade will not be fulfilled. Sources of wealth are limited and if the labour source dries up, growth rates will decrease. The other source of skilled labour is returning emigrants. Again, a combination of factors attract people back to this country or inhibit their return. One is the high marginal rate of income tax at 46 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 were put down for debating purposes and to indicate that the Minister made no progress in this area in the budget. <Col N="25" /> The issue must be addressed but it will become quite difficult to do so. I am anxious to hear the Minister's reflections on this. As a result of the movement to tax credits, the negotiators on social partnership will insist not only on a global amount of tax relief in the end package but also &ndash; this will be the aim of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in particular &ndash; will seek to apply the global amount so that every worker will get the same relief. In the first year they will seek the return of £5, £8 or £10 a week. If it is a three year programme I anticipate a negotiating position where they will say: &ldquo;We do not want percentage reductions; we have a tax credit system and there can be £200 or £400 extra in everybody's tax credit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have a ready reckoner to estimate what each £100 of tax credit would cost in the year of introduction and in a full year? The negotiation process in the next social partnership agreement will suck up most of the Minister's available resources in terms of tax relief. It will certainly suck up the £350 million to which Deputy McDowell referred. The Minister could find himself in a situation where the exigencies of the negotiation process tie him into relief through the tax credit system, whose application would be equal across the range of income, and leave him with no resources to address this very serious issue, which will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister on Committee Stage to which he did not have an opportunity to reply. Has he considered the possibility of introducing another rate of tax at about 35 per cent? He will not have the resources to reduce significantly the 46 per cent rate. Even if the rate is reduced by a couple of points it will not address the issue anyway. The issue is not the level of the higher marginal rate &ndash; whether it is 45 per cent or 46 per cent is not a huge issue &ndash; but that people must pay 46 per cent rather than 24 per cent across a tranche of income which most people would consider a moderate rate of remuneration.</P>
    <P>Is there a paper in the file of papers from the tax strategy group which postulates that more progress might be made if the jump in rate was not so extreme from 24 per cent to 46 per cent? Has the Minister examined the potential of a middle level rate where a tranche of income which is now subject to tax at 46 per cent would be subject to the middle rate and has he run any numbers on it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this issue at length on Committee Stage when I asked the Minister to consider a transitional tax rate between the lower and higher rates to ease the shock of moving from the 24 per cent rate to the 46 per cent rate when one's income reaches £14,000. The Minister did not respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the improvements that have been made in the tax regime in the past three budgets, we still have a penal tax regime on work when one compares it to that of our nearest neighbours. <Col N="26" /> The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced his budget yesterday but I have not had an opportunity to study it. However, according to media reports this morning further improvements have been made in the UK tax regime. A single person in England can earn £190 a week before being taxed whereas in Ireland the figure will be £100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must improve and strive to reach the English level. This is a matter of competitiveness. Many SMEs are barely surviving. There were some casualties in recent weeks. They cannot afford to pay extra wages to staff in many instances because the banks are squeezing them. Banks squeeze small companies and individuals in particular.</P>
      <P>Many SMEs are owned by one or two people. They are under considerable pressure; they are not multinationals. The only way their workers can be rewarded is through the taxation system. We should put more money in their pockets through a more acceptable and friendly taxation system. In the case of lower and middle income workers, we are not moving fast enough in that respect, given the latitude available to the Minister to deliver a better tax package. We are anxious to encourage people to work. One of the main ways of doing that is through the taxation system but we are not responding to that need.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any figures to estimate what a hypothetical medium rate of tax at 35 per cent would cost? The public would accept the introduction of such a rate.</P>
      <P>When I tabled an amendment on VRT on Committee Stage seeking to remove the 25 per cent band, the Minister specifically said the jump from 22.5 per cent to the higher rate of 30 per cent would be too great. In this case there is a jump in the rates from 24 per cent to 46 per cent. That is not consistent with the argument put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage in response to my amendment on VRT. I would like him to consider these points and to comment on our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> our tax regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is specifically intended to target one group. I do not support the view that our marginal rates of tax are particularly high and that is the urgent issue we need to address. This amendment seeks to address the position of single people earning £14,000 to £20,000 per annum. They should pay tax at the standard rate, but they must pay it at the higher rate. I was interested to hear what Deputies Noonan and Deenihan said about a middle rate of tax, but I was not persuaded by their argument. Effectively, we have two higher rates of tax, taking into account the cumulative effect of PRSI, PAYE and income tax. The marginal rate of tax payable by an employee earning less than the PRSI ceiling is higher than for employees earning more than it. I never understood why there is a <Col N="27" /> PRSI ceiling. There is merit in examining the issue of equalising the tax treatment of employees on the higher rate, when account is taken of the tax and PRSI total, which is the way most people view it.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Noonan on the thrust of how matters will proceed in the future. The Minister is fighting on two fronts. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the rate of tax, which he strongly supports, and he introduced a fairer system, which has received wide acclaim publicly but which will tend to direct all the resources available for reduction of income tax equally at each taxpayer. The workers who are losing out are those caught in the structural trap. They are largely single people who earn slightly more than the standard rate band. While married people who earn £25,000 or £26,000 do not earn a great amount of money, they still earn significantly more than the average industrial wage. Single people who earn less than the average industrial rate should not pay tax at the higher rate. That structural problem needs to be addressed as well as the two fronts the Minister opened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are a repeat of the amendments tabled by Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and McDowell on Committee Stage. They propose to increase the standard rate band by £1,000 for single persons and £2,000 for married couples. This is proposed in addition to the substantial increase in the standard band provided for in the Bill and it would result in an additional cost of £85.2 million in 1999 and £144.6 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>This year I concentrated on a major reform of the tax system to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and to maximise the incentive to work. This is the first step towards a tax credit system. While it is true that the increase in the standard band is mainly to compensate higher rate taxpayers in the initial move to tax credits, there are also substantial increases in personal allowances which benefit all taxpayers. Accordingly, the additional relief available this year has been put into allowances rather than rates or rate bands.</P>
      <P>The cost of the personal tax reliefs provided for this year comes to a substantial £581 million in a full year and is the most that can be afforded. The changes I introduced in this year's Finance Bill will mark a fundamental departure in personal taxation. A single person on PAYE will not have to pay tax on income below £100 per week and more than 80,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net altogether. These changes will unquestionably improve the incentive to work. Furthermore, these changes will pave the way for future changes to be made more easily over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Deputies asked a question as to the cost of increasing a tax credit by £100. My experts inform me that it would cost approximately £154 <Col N="28" /> million in a full year, but that is subject to further analysis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of an intermediate tax rate between the 24 per cent rate and the 46 per cent rate. He also raised that issue on Committee Stage. In the run up to the budget each year I give consideration to a wide variety of taxation proposals. I have been long enough in politics and certainly in business to remember a time when there were a number of tax rates. At one time there was a surcharge on top of the highest tax rate. There was a range of tax rates up to a rate of 70 per cent on which there was a 10 per cent surcharge, making 77 per cent the top rate. In recent times the tax rates were reduced to two, but 25 years ago there were a number of tax rates starting at 26 per cent, then a 35 per cent rate followed by a range of rates up to the higher rate. It is relatively a new departure to have only two rates. I am not signalling any possible change in this area, but my mind is not closed to any changes that might be beneficial, although this is not on my agenda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised a question about encouraging people, particularly married women, back into the workforce. The percentage of married women participating in the workforce has increased in recent years <i>vis-à-vis</i> the low percentage of married women who participated in the past, but it is still not up to the EU average although it is approaching it. There is a need to create an incentive for people to come back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of child care. In the budget I referred to the forthcoming report on child care which has now been published. As I said on Committee Stage, the debate on child care has broadened. It is not narrowly focused on the taxation changes demanded before the budget. Since the budget the debate has widened considerably and the difficulties and different approaches to tackling this problem are more in the public domain than they were prior to the budget.</P>
    <P>I agree that the 46 per cent tax rate does not encourage people to return to the workforce. It also influences the decisions of Irish people living abroad who wish to return here. The fact that employees reach the higher rate of taxation so early compared to the position in the United Kingdom is also a disincentive to many people returning home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised a question about PRSI ceilings. They have been there for some time. The logic behind them is that they are increased every year, but there is a case for exam<Col N="29" /> ining them. I am sure everyone would not agree with the Deputy's view, but I agree with it. In an earlier contribution he said everyone should make some small contribution to the State. It may surprise him that I also agree with him on that, but this view is not universally held. I would say we are in the minority in regard to our shared view on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I cannot accept the Deputies' amendments because the cost of so doing would be substantial. Furthermore, this year I concentrated on tax credits but also increased the personal allowances significantly.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>4.&ndash;Where a claimant proves for a year of assessment that income received by him or her consisted of dividends paid by a credit union within the meaning of the Credit Union Act, 1997, the first £750 of such income shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating his or her liability to income tax for that year of assessment.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to implement one element of the recommendations of the working group on the credit union report. My intention in putting down the amendment was that the full report of the working group should be implemented. However, because of the rules of the House, I am not permitted to put down the other amendments which were ruled out of order on Committee Stage. I intend to relate my contribution to the full report and all its recommendations, not specifically the element of this amendment. We have gone down this road before. The Minister went down this road last year and got his fingers badly burnt. He has now clearly decided, unless I am misreading the signals completely, that he will not touch this forever and a day. That is not good enough. There is an overwhelming case, accepted by almost every Member, for the tax treatment of credit union savings, whether that is deposit interest or dividend, to be distinctly different from that of other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The arguments for this are well known, and all Members have received considerable representations on the matter in recent weeks. These arguments refer to the diffuse nature of the credit unions, which are spread throughout the country, and though there are small and large credit unions, it is a legal requirement that each credit union's members all share a common bond. They serve different types of customers, though not radically different socio-economic groups from those served by the former mutual societies or the banks. They are also largely, though not entirely, staffed by volunteers rather than professional people. Perhaps most importantly of all, their primary purpose is not to make profits; their primary purpose is to serve the interests of their members rather than to make a profit for the corporate group.</P>
      <P>If we were to implement the working group report, we would increase the tax take to the Revenue while treating savers in a fairer way. We all know that the current rules are not implemented, nor can they be implemented, and we should not hide that fact. We all know that a significant number of people, probably the majority, makes a certain amount of money by way of dividend &ndash; a small amount in most cases &ndash; and does not declare that for income tax purposes. I suspect that quite a few people who earn money by way of dividend do not know they are meant to declare those dividends for income tax purposes. It is not fair that somebody who has a relatively small amount of money on deposit with a credit union might have to pay tax at the marginal rate of 46 per cent. If they had the same amount of money in a bank, the DIRT would be deducted at source.</P>
      <P>The case is overwhelming, and it is one virtually every Member accepts. On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister if he accepted the statement included in the working group's report under the title &ldquo;Statement on the part of the Department of Finance&rdquo;. If he does, then he should say so, as that statement makes it clear that the Department sees no case for further favourable tax treatment of credit unions. If that is the Minister's view, let him put it up front, and let us have a debate on it. Let him try to justify his case to his colleagues and to the country. If he does not agree with the statement, it is incumbent on him to say so rather than to hide behind the catch-all phrase, &ldquo;he is considering his position.&rdquo;  We all know well that he has no intention of moving on the working group's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set up this working group last year when he got his fingers burnt. It debated through last summer and came up with recommendations accepted by all its representatives &ndash; including the Department responsible for administering credit unions, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &ndash; except the representatives of the Revenue and his Depart<Col N="33" /> ment. The Minister has sat on it since. He has had four or five months to consider if he wants to implement this. I believe he should, but at the very least he should tell us what he intends to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, and I am glad Deputy McDowell discussed the working group's recommendations. I put down an amendment on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage which has been ruled out of order. I do not understand the ruling. I understood one could not propose an amendment which imposed a charge but that one could table one which recommended a relief. The amendments I tabled would have the effect of exempting some dividend income from tax completely and would have the effect of having the balance subject to DIRT tax at 20 per cent, which would be full and final settlement. The present position is that there is a tax liability on both interest on deposits in credit unions and on dividends paid on shares in credit unions which applies at the marginal rate of tax. For many of the depositors this is 46 per cent. Frankly, I do not understand how what to any lay person is a reduction in tax can be presented as a charge. I did not fully understand the letter of explanation I got either. Be that as it may, Deputy McDowell has been more skilful in drafting than I have.</P>
      <P>It is now part of political folklore that the Minister got his fingers burnt when he dealt with the credit unions in the past. When the full history of this matter is written by the credit union movement, it will probably admit that the Minister was of the view that he had an agreement with the credit union movement before he moved to make certain tax changes in respect of their debited income and the income of depositors. It gave rise to an unwholesome and unholy row, and the Minister pulled his fingers out of the fire politically by setting up a working group. At the time it looked as if he would legislate on foot of the report of the working party, but now he refuses to do so. What is more relevant is that he not only refuses to accept the views of the working group, but he refuses to tell us why he finds those views unacceptable. On Committee Stage we were given no reason apart from phrases such as &ldquo;once bitten, twice shy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very strong case to be made here. The credit union movement is different from other financial institutions. There are more than 40,000 volunteers giving freely of their time to put small savings schemes in place for their neighbours and others in their communities, and they should be treated differently. More importantly, the depositors and shareholders in credit unions are not complying with the law at the moment. The Minister is making tax criminals out of many small people throughout the country. He is making tax criminals of the little people because he will not move along the lines we are suggesting. Deputy McDowell's amendment and the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage are acceptable to the credit union movement. The Minister could <Col N="34" /> use my Committee Stage amendment to remove a political problem from his desk and introduce a fair tax regime for the credit union movement. I have had no representations to the contrary, even from the other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>There are limits, ever since Deputy Rabbitte brought in amending legislation, to the amount of money that can be put on deposit in credit unions and the amount of shares which can be held by an individual. However, when one matches the Minister's reluctance to legislate in this area with the powers now being given to the Revenue and which they will no doubt have as soon as the President signs the Bill, we have a situation where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for saying that most depositors in credit unions are evading tax. A Revenue Commissioner could sign an order to give an inspector access to credit union accounts. Against the background of tribunals, the Tánaiste's investigation into National Irish Bank, the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation into the payment or non-payment of DIRT by Allied Irish Banks before 1992, it would be ironic if the most obvious application of the new powers would be against the small savers in credit unions.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is right; extra money will be collected if the Minister does this. I do not believe the Minister is getting much in the way of self-declaration by depositors in credit unions, as by and large the savers are small savers who are not making returns on the tax liabilities due on their interest or dividends to any great extent. Some are compliant, but many of them do not realise they have an obligation. If the Minister moved along the lines suggested and took 20 per cent DIRT on the bulk of the money which is on deposit in credit unions, there would be an additional return to the Exchequer. If the Minister does not propose to do that, will he explain the reason other than by saying he must be cautious given that he was caught before? That is not a sufficient explanation. He has to deal with the merits of the working party proposals and explain in detail if he is turning down those recommendations. If he is rejecting them, there is still a problem in respect of the credit union issue and he will have to propose an alternative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the same commercial operating rules are applied to credit unions as to mainstream banks the effectiveness of credit unions will be diluted nationwide. Deputy McDowell explained the benefits of credit unions, the voluntary element and their commitment to urban and rural areas. As Deputy Noonan said, they took on the little people, those whom the banks would not entertain and those who would be intimidated by going into banks. They provided a service. There is a perception that the Minister has an agenda against credit unions. It may be exaggerated to some extent. By not accepting this minimalist amendment in the name of Deputy McDowell and the amendment in the names of Deputy Noonan and I, which was ruled <Col N="35" /> out of order, the Minister is confirming he is not sensitive to the needs of credit unions.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement can be compared to the co-operative movement. Both movements have involved volunteers and have made a greater contribution to the whole of Ireland than any other similar movement. That is the reason the Minister should be more sensitive to the needs of credit unions and should not dismiss what they are seeking.</P>
      <P>When the credit unions agreed to set up the working party it was one way for the Minister to save face. The credit unions expected that whatever the recommendations of the working party, they would be put in place afterwards. They were prepared to accept the recommendations, irrespective of how unpalatable, of the working party. Having set up the working party, it is mind-boggling that the Minister rejected its recommendations. There is much annoyance in credit unions. While I admire the Minister for his independence, in this case it is the little people, the small investor, those who would be intimidated by going into a bank and those whom the bank would not entertain &ndash; not the fat cats &ndash; who are being penalised. This is an attack on a section of the population which was marginalised in the past and which has found a new independence by virtue of the availability of, and accessibility to, credit unions. The Minister should not apply the normal commercial rules to credit unions but should adopt a different approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I set up a working group last year to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings. This group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Terence Larkin, was comprised of members of the League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and senior officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my own Department and the Revenue Commissioners. I received the report of the working group last October and I recently made it publicly available.</P>
      <P>Anybody who reads the report will see there are apparently good arguments for and against special tax breaks for investment returns on credit union savings. After six meetings of the working group it was not possible for members to reach a consensus and, in the absence of an agreed position, the chairman made a number of recommendations, namely, that credit union surpluses should continue to be exempt from corporation tax; 20 per cent DIRT should apply to interest on all credit union deposits; 20 per cent DIRT should apply to all dividends from shares except where the dividend in any year is £750 or less, and in such cases only the first £375 would be exempt; and there should be no reporting to Revenue of interest or dividends on credit union savings. Two of the group members did not support these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still considering this report. There are important issues to be decided, including issues <Col N="36" /> of tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if tax breaks given to credit union savers have to be extended to savers in other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>There is also an EU dimension. The corporation tax exemption for credit unions has been questioned in Brussels as constituting a possible State aid. One consideration apparently influencing the Commission in taking a benign attitude to the corporation tax exemption from a State aid standpoint is that the members themselves are liable to income tax on the dividends. However, this benign attitude might change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax.</P>
    <P>Also on the EU front, we have proposals for a directive on the taxation of interest on savings, including credit union savings. The proposal here is to have either a withholding tax, at a proposed rate of 20 per cent, or reporting to the Revenue authorities in the country of residence.</P>
    <P>All these issues need careful consideration. The different views in the working group reflects the complexity of this issue and the need to examine carefully all the implications before coming forward with firm proposals. In the meantime, I am not in a position to accept Deputy McDowell's proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell said that forever and a day I had closed my mind on this issue. Forever and a day is a very long time in life, but in politics it does not bear contemplating. It is akin to grappling with how one defines infinity. Forever and a day is too strong a phrase. Deputy McDowell and others said many innocent taxpayers are unaware they should return their credit union interest. For the information of the House, on form 12 there is a box which refers to this matter and it should be filled in. That box has been there for some time. It is interesting to note that Deputies from all sides are putting forward their views and agreeing with the working group report. However, when the report was leaked last October there was no agreement among the Labour spokesperson, Deputy McDowell, the Democratic Left spokesperson, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Noonan. Each had different advice to offer.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's approach has been consistent. He called on the Minister to implement the recommendations of the working group. Deputy Rabbitte took a totally opposite view when he described them as a penny-pinching exercise that would serve only to limit the capacity of credit unions to invest in their own communities and was vehemently opposed to the working group's proposals. It does not take much for Deputy Rabbitte to change sides because the party to which he now belongs has been changing its name for at least 28 or 30 years. Given that he has joined the Labour Party, he will have no difficulty changing his views on this matter since his party has a history of changing sides.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Noonan raised a similar point. Has it ever crossed Deputy Noonan's mind, as it has mine, that it is only the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties which have a history and that mistakes we made ten, 20, 25 or 30 years ago are always referred to? Has the Deputy noticed that parties of the left can change their names and their past is obliterated? That happens not only with parties of the left; there is at least one other party whose members have no past at all. Has Deputy Noonan come to the same conclusion that it is only Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies who have to live with their past, whether it be 1926, 1956 or 1976? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 5, I refer to the working group report to which the League Credit Unions now subscribes which recommends DIRT at 20 per cent on interest. When I hear members of the League of Credit Unions getting headlines on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or in the newspapers saying they seek this DIRT on interest, then I will look at the matter again. Amazingly, despite all their comments on this, I have not seen headlines on this particular issue. When I hear their spokespersons shouting on the airwaves for extra taxation, which is part of the working group document to which they subscribe, I will give it further consideration.</P>
      <P>It is important to be cautious in this regard because there is also an EU dimension to this matter. The EU looks as if it will take a benign attitude to the corporation tax exemption on credit unions but only on the understanding that members are taxed on the way out. It regards it as a circular flow of money. If that was to change, the EU is likely to take a different view on this matter. That must be borne in mind in any changes we are likely to make and also by people who advocate agreeing to the working group's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and Deputy Deenihan said it is only the little people who subscribe to credit unions. The survey done by the League of Credit Unions on the socio-economic profile of members is not testimony to that view. The breakdown of membership of credit unions is, to all intents and purposes, the same as the breakdown of the population. Like all statistics, I could pick elements which suit my arguments, while the credit unions could pick ones to suit theirs. Any objective consideration would lead one to believe that membership comprises a fairly wide representative cross section of the people. I am sure people in the Law Library and RTE, which have <Col N="38" /> credit unions, will be delighted to have been referred to as the little people. I am certain they think of themselves in those terms and that their earnings are the same as those of the little people of Ireland. There are tremendous credit unions in both RTE and the Law Library.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I outlined in my reply, I will give this matter further consideration, taking on board the very sound advice given by Deputy Noonan when the report came out last October and despite the fact Deputy McDowell said the opposite to Deputy Rabbitte. Deputy Noonan advised me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to be very cautious in my approach and I am glad to accept his advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this discussion, being a supporter of credit unions. I go along with Deputy Deenihan in terms of it being a small savers club. Big business people are not customers of credit unions that have helped many families to save money for a rainy day, which is extremely important. Credit unions may attract customers other than the traditional small householder, business or farmer because of the success they have achieved over the years by working on a voluntary basis encouraging and advising people who wish to borrow for a special occasion such as a wedding, funeral or another family expense.</P>
      <P>The credit union system is not the same as the banking one; they do not operate in the same way and should be treated differently. The Minister should reconsider his approach to credit unions and have a more sympathetic view of the role they have played and the work they have done over many years in helping people. Maybe the country is experiencing good times but the Celtic tiger has not appeared in every household, many of which still face difficulties. The costs which arise for those with young families and children at school must be met and credit unions play a part in that regard. I ask the Minister to consider the recommendations made to him, treat them in a positive manner and to give encouragement to the credit unions to continue the work in which they have been involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Are figures available for the current tax take on dividend interest? I asked this question on Committee Stage but do not believe we got a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no figures.</P>
      <P>I want to scotch the notion that I am not sympathetic to the credit union movement. The credit union movement is wide-ranging and it is impossible to compare the credit unions, to which I referred in my reply to Deputy Deenihan, with some of those about which Deputy Boylan spoke. It must be borne in mind that I referred to the EU angle. There was a corporation tax exemption in the previous Finance Bill and to make further changes at this time might put that at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the credit union movement. Prior to the movement coming to see me <Col N="39" /> at its request and to last year's Finance Bill, I told the person who had asked to meet me that I had no intention to impose taxation on the credit union movement and would exempt it from corporation tax. To oblige the individual organising the meeting, I said I would meet them in any event. It was not my intention to impose any changes prior to last year's Finance Bill. It was when the credit union movement came to see me at their request that this particular hoo-ha started last year. That is what the record will show. I had no proposals to impose any taxation changes whatsoever on the credit union movement prior to the Finance Bill, 1998. I pointed that out to the person who requested the meeting. In order to oblige the individual acting on behalf of the credit union movement, I agreed to see them and they put forward their proposals.</P>
    <P>I am very reluctant to revisit this matter because, when I did what they asked me to do, I did not find many people in my corner. Deputy Noonan is right in that I am extremely cautious about revisiting this matter and even more cautious about doing so in the light of noises coming from Europe. While I want to put to rest the claim that I am not sympathetic to the credit union movement, I have learned to be very wary of the said leadership.</P>

      <P>As an aside, perhaps you will permit me, Chairman, a couple of sentences in response to the Minister's interesting reflections about left wing parties. The Minister seems to forget that the Labour Party is still the oldest party in the State, and the name has not changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. Having said that, we are open to offers from anybody in this House, not that I expect one soon from the Minister, but perhaps there are others here present or in the general precincts who might be willing to subscribe to the values and ethos of the Labour Party in future.</P>

    <P>The Minister makes two arguments in favour of the current position. He says that we have to look at the tax equity issue and the tax take. Both Deputy Noonan and I have argued, without proper riposte from the Minister, that the tax take would actually increase because at the moment people sim<Col N="40" /> ply do not make returns. I do not think that argument stands up and we do not need to delay further upon it. The rest of the argument we have been having on and off over the past year has been about equity and whether it is fair to treat credit unions in a particular way. This is the whole argument that revolves around amendment No. 5 and the working group report published six months ago. The argument we are making is that tax equity demands that we treat credit unions in an entirely different fashion.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, the Minister is homing in at this stage on the European aspect. The case will stand or fall in Europe on the very nature of the credit union movement. The credit union movement will, no doubt, make the case that it is different and not competing with the other financial institutions which are bringing this case. Without wishing to second guess what the European Commission might think, if one looks at the hundreds of millions of pounds in profit that the financial institutions are making, I find it difficult to see how they can realistically make the case that they are suffering because of competition from a non-profit institution like the credit union movement. That argument does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing an injustice to the Irish League of Credit Unions. Let us not go back over last year because we all know what happened, roughly speaking. Given what has been said by representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions over the past four or five weeks, it is quite clear that it has been up front with its members and its individual credit union institutions. I have seen the correspondence and its latest bulletin to individual credit unions which makes it clear exactly what the position is. All the credit unions that are making representations at the moment to Members of this House know the consequences of implementation of the working group report. They know that this will impose, although not in practice, a tax on people who are currently not paying tax. The Minister is doing them an injustice by suggesting that they are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of their members or the public.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the tone of the Minister's response that he has no intention of acting on this. He says he is not sitting on the matter forever and a day but I will happily take a wager with him that he will sit on it at least until the end of his tenure as Minister for Finance. I intend to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>In view of the time constraints I will concentrate on seeking a response to amendment No. 8, which relates to the tax credit which would be provided to widows.

      <P>In last year's Finance Act I endeavoured to provide a special regime for widows and would have gone further but for the cost. As I pointed out on Committee Stage of that legislation, my predeliction is to head in that direction. Because of my background I feel widows have been discriminated against in a variety of areas and I vowed I would do something about that if I was ever in a position to do so. That predates my entry to Leinster House. However, as I found when examining the matter before my first budget, the difficulty as regards the tax code is that, logically, this must be extended to all lone parents, which builds up a considerable cost. I would have done more in this regard but for that. When the tax credit system is fully introduced I will ensure there is no discrimination.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I gave an undertaking to consider for Report Stage amendments put down by Deputy McDowell to section 5 which sought to substitute &ldquo;18 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;16 years&rdquo; in the definition of a &ldquo;qualifying child&rdquo; for the purposes of section 462 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This section provides for an additional allowance for widows and other single parents. To qualify for an additional allowance a qualifying child must be under 16 years of age or, if over that age, be receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment or be permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from retaining himself or herself and must have become so incapacitated before age 21 or while receiving full time instruction at an educational establishment. Similar age related definitions of a qualifying child are contained in section 465 of that Act, which provides for tax relief in respect of an incapacitated child, and section 469, which provides for relief of health expenses.</P>
      <P>The amendments I now propose will change the unconditional age limit of 16 years to 18 years in all three provisions. The references to a child receiving full time education at an educational establishment includes a child undergoing an apprenticeship in a trade or profession, providing full-time training lasts a minimum of two years. I thank the Deputy for making these suggestions on Committee Stage and am glad to be able to accede to them.</P>

      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 6 to 13, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;making the subscription, being subscriptions that meet either of the following conditions, namely&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the total amount of the subscriptions does not exceed £300,000, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) no amount of the subscriptions, at any time or after the specified return date for the chargeable period for which exemption is <Col N="46" /> first claimed under either subsection (2) or (3), constitutes a subscription made by any one person that is greater than 30 per cent of the total amount of the subscriptions;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which has become known as the &ldquo;Shane Broderick&rdquo; section, provides exemptions from income tax, first, for the trustees of trusts established with funds raised by public subscriptions for the benefit of permanently and totally incapacitated individuals, and second, for the incapacitated individuals in respect of payments made by the trustees of such a public subscriptive trust to or for their benefit. In the Finance Bill as initiated I included in the definition of public subscriptions the condition that any one person could not contribute more than 30 per cent of the total subscriptions raised. This limit was set to complement the requirement that the fund be raised by public subscription and also recognised that there may be large individual donations. In the case of a total subscription of £500,000, the limit for a single donation by one person would therefore be £150,000.</P>
    <P>In the select committee's examination of the Bill Deputy Noonan and Deputy Deenihan pointed out that there may be cases where, following a public appeal for funds, a single generous donation by a relative or neighbour in entirely bona fide circumstances would rule out tax relief because of the 30 per cent limit. I accepted this point and gave an undertaking to bring forward on Report Stage a suitably framed amendment to remove the 30 per cent limit where total subscriptions raised from the trust fund following a public appeal did not exceed £300,000, a figure which I understand is acceptable to the Deputies. Amendment No. 17 gives effect to that undertaking and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I presume the Deputies will not press their amendment. Amendment No. 18 is not technically correct. It seeks to disable the 30 per cent rule in respect of funds less than £300,000, whereas the limit is related to the total subscriptions raised rather than the total funds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is required to correct an error in a section included on Committee Stage. The reference to &ldquo;a dealing member firm of the Irish Stock Exchange&rdquo; is obsolete and should be replaced with a reference to &ldquo;an authorised member firm of the Irish Stock Exchange, within the meaning of the Stock Exchange Act, 1995&rdquo;.

      <P>In page 42, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The Minister for Finance shall lay draft regulations before Dáil Éireann which will regulate the conduct of business by qualifying fund managers and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, when we examined the proposals for pensions the Minister confirmed that while he was taking power to authorise particular financial institutions or providers of pension funds he was not authorising individual fund managers. This amendment requires the Minister to put draft regulations before the Dáil which will regulate the conduct of business by qualifying fund managers.</P>
      <P>It is quite important to do so. The Minister will be aware that we received much correspondence on his proposals. He should reflect on what happened in the UK when pensions were liberalised &ndash; there was huge mis-selling of pension products and the total fines imposed on the industry by the treasury exceeded £1 billion. The Minister's changes must be put in the context of the Government's decision to appoint the former Deputy, Mr. Michael McDowell, SC, to chair a committee examining the regulation of the financial services sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look at this again when he gets an opportunity because there was huge abuse in the UK when pensions were liberalised. While he is regulating in respect of the institutions he is not doing so in respect of individuals, nor is he providing anything about the nature of the product.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 27, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I spoke with the German Chancellor, Mr. Gerhard Schröder, on Monday evening, 22 February. We discussed the then forthcoming informal summit in Petersburg and, in particular, the agriculture proposals under the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The Chancellor indicated that he was aware of the problems these proposals posed for Ireland but stressed his confidence that an overall compromise on agriculture could be found. I will meet Chancellor Schröder in Dublin on 19 March as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the special meeting of the European Council in Berlin on 24 and 25 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission had an informal summit in Petersburg in Germany on 26 February. As had been decided in advance, given the nature of the summit, no formal decisions were taken and no written conclusions were issued. The summit commenced with a brief meeting with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. José Maria Gil-Robles. The first working session focused on the future financial resources of the Union. We discussed and developed ideas on the reform of Cohesion and agricultural policies and reviewed the possible options and guidelines for a compromise package, in preparation for the conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations at the special meeting of the European Council in Berlin. I outlined Ireland's position, the losses we would face even under the current Agenda 2000 proposals from the Commission, our significant development needs, notably infrastructural, and <Col N="51" /> made clear the areas of central concern to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The next part of the summit, which took place over lunch, included discussions on external issues such as the situation in Kosovo, the Middle East, the Oçalan case and a short report on the summit meeting between the European Union and the Russian President in Moscow. We took the opportunity to discuss the process to fill forthcoming vacancies within the EU, including the next President of the Commission and the High Representative for CFSP. President Santer also delivered a brief progress report on the current work on reforming the Commission.</P>
    <P>The final session allowed for further discussion of Agenda 2000 related issues. I should stress that, following this summit and the recent meeting of the Agriculture Council, I remain confident that we can obtain an equitable outcome for Ireland in the negotiations. The Petersburg meeting also presented me with an opportunity for a short bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. We discussed the current situation in Northern Ireland and developments in the peace process.</P>
    <P>I met the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene, and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, on 3 March in Brussels. These meetings focused on the current state of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, particularly following on from the informal summit in Petersburg. I emphasised the principal points of concern to Ireland. I stressed again the considerable development needs of Ireland and the importance of an equitable outcome from the negotiations. I also discussed issues of a bilateral nature during these meetings. In relation to the Northern Ireland peace process, I thanked President Santer for his support in particular, and the support of the Commission in general.</P>
    <P>While in Brussels, I also took the opportunity to meet briefly with European Commissioner, Padraig Flynn. We had a useful discussion on the current state of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The meeting, at this point in the Agenda 2000 negotiation process, gave important insights on the Commission's perspective on some of the issues of most concern to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee and the expert technical group on Agenda 2000 which I chair has met and will continue to meet in preparation for the Petersburg Summit, bilateral discussions and the forthcoming Berlin Summit meetings. The membership of the Cabinet sub-committee is comprised of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Agriculture and Food. This committee is serviced by the expert technical group which I also chair and which is comprised of senior officials from the Departments represented on the Cabinet sub-committee. The Cabinet sub-committee held an initial meeting in early January. The expert technical group has since met six times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Most recently, I chaired a high-level meeting of Ministers and Ministers of State on 2 March when, together with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and senior officials, I briefed the meeting on the Government's strategy on Agenda 2000 and the issue of regionalisation. All papers produced by the expert technical group are submitted to the relevant Ministers on the sub-committee. In addition, I discuss the relevant issues with individual members of the Cabinet sub-committee as necessary.</P>
    <P>The issues involved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and their implications have been discussed on a regular basis, as part of my ongoing contacts with the social partners. For example, I had a meeting on Thursday, 25 February with the Irish Farmers' Association representatives about progress in the negotiations. I also met representatives of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association on 2 March. We discussed the Agenda 2000 proposals and in particular those relating to agriculture. The outcome of Agenda 2000 will form an important context for negotiations with the social partners on any successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I will attend the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 28 and 29 June. This will be the first such summit between the two regions and will address a broad range of issues, including the strengthening of democracy, human rights and development matters. The summit will also deal with common action against trafficking in drugs, international organised crime and terrorism and will consider UN reform and a range of economic issues. My schedule in Rio has not yet been finalised, but I expect to have a number of bilateral meetings on the margins of the summit, including meetings to seek support for Ireland's candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council. While a visit to Argentina and Mexico in conjunction with the summit is under consideration, no final programme for these essentially trade related visits has been agreed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In the course of the Taoiseach's discussions with EU leaders, was the Government's corporation tax policy raised? Was it noted that, in comparison to the rates of tax paid by ordinary people and the much higher rates which apply to big business in most European countries, this country's current and projected rates of corporation tax discriminate heavily in favour of big business? Have countries which contribute substantially to the EU budget &ndash; to the benefit of this country &ndash; made strong objections in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his discussions with EU leaders, and with reference to his proposed visit to Latin America, has the possibility of a trade war between the EU and the United States been discussed in view of the recent threat of action by the US in respect of the importation of bananas into Europe? The United States Government is throwing its full weight behind multinational companies based in <Col N="53" /> that country. As the Taoiseach knows, this matter involves a much larger agenda because, following a resolution of the current problem, the US intends to seek permission to export beef containing artificial hormones and genetically modified crops to Europe. Were these issues discussed and, if so, what views were expressed? </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two matters mentioned were not specifically on the agenda. The second matter, that of trade, was not raised, although it is referred to regularly and has been discussed by the European Commission. It has also been raised in discussions with the Tánaiste. The issue of tax is also raised regularly. There has been ongoing discussion about tax harmonisation and co-operation. The various corporation tax regimes are being examined and a report prepared which will be presented later in the year. The system in place here for 30 years is transparent. The rates for small and medium-sized industries are being reduced to the rates that apply to large companies. I have explained to my counterparts that this is one of the few member states in which corporation tax has been increased by 25 per cent for many companies. Other countries have still complained, however, about the 12.5 per cent rate. The examination will show that some of these negotiate what we might consider sweetheart deals with large companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Agenda 2000 negotiations, what will happen if there is a conflict between the decisions taken by the Ministers for Agriculture and the financial envelopes laid down by the Ministers for Finance? Is it the Taoiseach's information that the commitments tentatively agreed by the Ministers for Agriculture are in excess of the annual budget limit set by the Ministers for Finance of 40.5 becu? By what amount do they exceed the limit? How and by whom will the matter be resolved? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that it will make the European Council more difficult. The Agriculture Ministers were asked to negotiate a package within an average annual budget of 40.5 becu over seven years. I spoke to President Santer and his officials this day last week. I do not have the precise figure but at that stage it looked as if the Agriculture Council would be out by about 15 becu.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I do not want to speculate, it is a question of whether the figure of 40.5 becu can be maintained. Many countries, France in <Col N="54" /> particular, as a negotiating position, have put accounts on the table which account for a large part of the 15 becu. I have continually raised the issue of milk reform, the cost of which is 8 becu. It has been shown that this will not do much for the net contributors. Nothing has been agreed but the Irish position is not supported by the Agriculture Council which is in session again today. Bilateral meetings have been continuing since Monday. I have received no further word that would correct the figures by a substantial amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Agriculture Ministers have agreed there should be milk reform which will not commence until 2002? Does this alter the arithmetic to a significant extent? On regionalisation, has there been further communication with or from EUROSTAT on the Government's proposals? Do the Government's proposals include Clare and Kerry or is there an amendment in that regard? In regard to the lunch time discussion to which the Taoiseach referred at which the Presidency of the European Commission and the High Representative on Common Foreign and Security Policy were discussed, is there a tentative agreement that, if the Presidency goes to a larger country, the position of High Representative, as is normal in EU appointments, should go to a smaller country? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On milk reform, what the Deputy said is a consideration but all the agricultural prices have not been agreed. There is, however, general agreement in the Agriculture Council on the need for reform. The European Council and the farm organisations support this position. One cannot say 'no' to everything. The scale has not yet been agreed. Given the cost involved, 8 becu, this area will have to be looked at. On regionalisation, the original application is still on the table. There were further meetings yesterday between officials of DG XVI and the Department of Finance. Officials of EUROSTAT and the CSO are meeting today. On the allocation of positions, there was no agreement at the European Council on how these should be divided. The matter will be discussed at the June summit at which I will argue that smaller countries should have representation.</P>

      <P>Has any Head of Government put it to the Taoiseach that Ireland's rate of corporation tax is too low and that our expectations in respect of enhanced funds and the amounts on the table in the Agenda 2000 negotiations cannot be squared? Has a specific proposal of that kind been put to the Taoiseach by any of the Heads of Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There are two separate issues &ndash; Agenda 2000 and the negotiations on the contributions we hope to continue to get as net recipients. The negotiations deal with our relative wealth and our position regarding the 75 per cent threshold. I have had many discussions on these matters with practically all the Heads of Government.</P>
      <P>The discussion on corporation tax is centred on what will happen to the taxes of the Union in the context of future harmonisation or co-operation. Heads of Government, Finance Ministers in ECOFIN and Trade Ministers are concerned that one country with a low tax rate will distort the marketplace and result in a loss of investment to their countries. They note that last year Ireland took 27 per cent of US investment to all of Europe. I never accept these concerns and robustly defend our position. I argue that we are efficient and competitive, that the country has worked hard, that there is social partnership, that the output of multinational companies located here is very good and that our workers work hard and are well educated. While several Heads of Government have confronted me on this, I do not believe I have lost a round.</P>

      <P>While Commissioners are independent once they take up office, they all maintain contact with their home countries. The briefings, information and dialogue Commissioner Flynn provides to my officials and officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food, including information he sent me last week, is very beneficial because they provide us with an insight into the arguments. I do not wish to go into detail because of the perceived position Commissioners hold on this. Such briefings are very useful and all other member states do the same.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if, in his discussions at the Bonn summit or at other meetings, the issue of the growth in inequalities in income distribution in the EU has arisen, including a consideration of the measures to be put in place with Agenda 2000 to address them? On the question of harmonisation, was the need to prevent competitive distortions in the enlarging market discussed? For example, carbon or eco taxes would need to be in place before enlargement to enable the eastern European countries benefit from their labour intensive economies. Is the Taoiseach in favour of this? The ESRI has said that if Ireland was to unilaterally adopt such an approach it would maintain our competitiveness.</P>

Some of the other matters raised by the Deputy are on the agenda of the Environmental Council and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been dealing with them.</P>
      <P>The issue of the spread of income distribution is a matter for domestic policy. As to what will happen to the tranches of money, that is not part of the negotiations, it is for us to determine domestically within the terms of our fiscal policies.

      <P>What proposals will the Government make on UN reform at the Europe-Latin America summit? Is the Government satisfied that there is sufficient co-ordination in Europe on the battle against drugs? Is EUROPOL moving forward at sufficient speed? Are better extradition arrangements required within Europe to facilitate extradition of international criminals within the Union? What are the Taoiseach's views on the possible development of a European criminal court to deal with those accused of organised international crime within the Union in view of the fact that we have already accepted <Col N="57" /> the precedent of extra-territoriality in the matter of crimes against humanity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of those issues will be discussed. No firm proposals have been made on a European criminal court. It will be a considerable time before it arises. I am in favour of extradition for drugs cases because it is clear that no country, especially a small country, can effectively deal with the drugs problem alone.</P>
      <P>This summit is the first meeting of its kind. Latin America continues to be the home of an enormous amount of drugs. EUROPOL has spelt out the routes it takes. Co-operation among administrations, including on extradition proceedings, will be required to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We support Kofi Annan's reform system at the UN, including his efforts to secure a less bureaucratic, more streamlined system and his attempts to give more powers to the administration. When he visited Ireland he made clear that many of the things he has been seeking to do since taking office are being frustrated due to lack of movement. Some measures have been implemented and we have supported him on this. While his budget has been dramatically reduced, he cannot get agreement on decisions without a mechanism to move matters through the debating groupings. That is frustrating the considerable efforts he has made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, following the establishment of the euro, the next big project for the EU is the battle against organised crime? Does he also agree that Ireland is at a specific disadvantage in this area because of the attitude of the British Government in refusing to join the Schengen arrangements? Does he further agree that we are isolated from co-operation in European criminal law matters, with which we want to be involved, because we are being forced by the attitude of the British Government to choose between having customs posts on the Border at Newry on the one hand, if we are to join the Schengen agreement, and, on the other hand, involvement with our European colleagues in the battle against organised crime, which is something we want to do? Can the Taoiseach take steps to persuade the British Government, which is adopting a more enlightened attitude to the euro than its predecessor, to similarly take a more enlightened attitude to involvement in the Schengen agreement than its predecessor? This British attitude is preventing the development of a coherent, Europe-wide battle against organised crime, of which Britain is just as much a victim as any other European country.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton is familiar with the negotiating stance adopted by everyone, including Britain, the last time around when there was little flexibility. I have discussed this issue with Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Deputy will be <Col N="58" /> aware that this week, two years later, they are moving on a number of the Schengen provisions.</P>
      <P>I agree the only way a country such as ours, whose coastline is used for drug trafficking, can combat the problems of drugs, criminality and organised gangs who have a vast amount of resources and are known to Europol and to different member states is through co-operation. It will not happen otherwise. There are many examples of states which lost out because they did not co-operate. I do not know what the British Government will do on the remainder of the Schengen provisions, but it has shown an openness to move on some of them and others are under discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach formed a view on whether a satisfactory conclusion on the issues of Agenda 2000 will be reached the week after next in Berlin under the German Presidency or does he feel the current gap is so wide it cannot be concluded in March and may go all the way to June? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the side of the countries which believe this should be concluded in a few weeks. The Agriculture Council is meeting in continuous session until it reaches a conclusion. It will be difficult for it to do that but it must try.</P>
      <P>There are considerable difficulties in relation to how the Cohesion and Structural Funds will be shared out. This moves back to the position of the 1.27 and how much head room can be created. As Deputy Quinn is aware, at 1.02, European spending is substantially below the 1.27. Everybody wants expenditure controlled in a way that is reasonable and fair. People will argue whether that can be done within the head room, particularly on the agriculture side. Even if 50 per cent of the increase is taken out, we are still talking about 47.5 million euros.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will be difficult. People are already saying they will go into the third day. If they are not concluded by 24, 25 or 26 March, we will move into a period where a number of countries have general elections. They have made it clear they will not be available for discussions during that period. It will also be the end of the remit of the Parliament.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The proposals we originally included in the application last autumn are still under discussion. The discussions are <Col N="60" /> between GD16, the Department of Finance, EUROSTAT and the CSO; my Department is not involved. I am interested in their outcome. The Deputy will be aware that there is an attempt by the Commission to push all outstanding issues into the final pot, although EUROSTAT is stated to be entirely independent, so that anything conceded is part of the final round of discussions. I do not like that type of negotiating. It is also happening in other countries on various issues. The Commission would be better to sign off issues to get an agreement. I made it clear to President Santer last week that it would be a tidier way of negotiating. However, if they are all to be thrown into the final pot, so be it.</P>

      <P>Is it right to assume that if the current negotiations are to be agreed in March, the amount of moneys Ireland will get from Structural and Cohesion Funds is independent and separate from whether an agreement is made on regionalisation or on Ireland being taken as one region in transition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision will have to be made either before or at Berlin because it would affect the overall figure, although not greatly. It is not a question of what the Structural Funds figure will be if any of the country is given Objective One status or is taken as Objective One in transition, but of what we can do in Objective One areas and the length of time we will have Structural Funds as Cohesion Funds will no longer exist. It is clear from the negotiations that the best we will get is a mid-term review. Even that will be a battle because some countries do not want that for any country or only for countries that will adopt the euro, while some others want an annual review. We are working to the Commission proposal and what will happen after 2006. The question of regionalisation for Ireland and other countries will have to be resolved either before or at Berlin.</P>

Do I take it the concept of co-financing has now been abandoned and that the Germans did not get their way on this issue? What influence does the Taoiseach believe that will have on the way Irish farmers will fare in this? It appears there will be major cuts in many of the farm products.

      <P>I do not want to repeat the replies I gave earlier but I did not say the Agriculture Council will conclude this week. I said I would like it to conclude but I do not see how it can because 40.5 billion euros is the benchmark figure around which they were asked to produce a package, and they are nowhere near that in the <Col N="61" /> negotiations. Co-financing has received little support. The Germans have proposed that the Presidency is strong on this but there is no other support for it and they have moved away from that. The French alternative of degressivity is far more likely to receive support. That has a benefit over straight stabilisation, which others want, but the advantage of degressivity, though not perfect from our point of view, is better than the other two. The way it is operated and in particular the thresholds are important because from an Irish perspective the thresholds will rule out the small holdings. We will negotiate as high a figure as we can &ndash; it stands at 5,000 euros, although farm bodies would like the figure to go a few thousand euros beyond that &ndash; to take out as many Irish farms as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to say. I explained earlier that the cost of the Commission proposals on dairying is eight billion euros. If that expenditure is to be consumed in trying to form a package, many other matters will be ruled out. I cannot see how the proposals on milk reform, at a cost of eight billion euros, can be built into an overall package of 40.5 billion euros. I said that when the proposals were brought forward on 18 March last and now people are facing up to that reality. In terms of what will happen, our preference would be similar to that of the French, that is, that milk reform would be excluded. It does not do anything for us or for the milk quota system if one does not get a good share of it, particularly since we have not got an understanding in regard to the 1984 agreement. I would like to see milk reform off the agenda. An alternative scheme might be to introduce milk reform but at a later date, like the degressivity on the other side. These are issues for negotiation and we just have to look after our interests. If I could get milk off the agenda and get a good package on beef I would be far happier in Berlin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a real problem with the availability of illegal and harmful material on the Internet, including paedophilia. Essentially this is an international problem which gives rise to highly complex legal and technical issues. Within these considerable restraints on national action, I have consistently taken whatever initiatives were open to me in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet set up in my Department and consisting of representatives from both the public and private sector submitted its first report to me last July. Focusing on child protection issues, the report recommended a system of self regulation by the service provider industry. I agreed with this approach and, with Government approval, initiated the protracted discussions which followed between officials in my Department and representatives of the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland on the question of implementing the self regulation aspects of the report. In simple terms, while the industry favoured a self regulation approach, it baulked at funding it. I do not regard this as a satisfactory response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Following the most recent round of direct discussions between my Department and senior executives from the main service provider organisations, I am advised they have agreed to bring forward urgently their response on the funding issue in respect of the proposed public complaints hotline and other elements of self regulation recommended in the report. My view and that of the Government is that if an industry needs and favours self regulation, logic dictates it must be prepared to pay for it. A reasonable period has been given to the service provider industry to work out its position on this matter and I look forward to its deliberations concluding shortly.</P>
    <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act which I introduced last year represented an important step in ensuring the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear on any person based here who becomes involved in child pornography on the Internet. This will be an important component in the overall set of anti-paedophile measures in this State.</P>
    <P>Although national initiatives can and will be taken in this area, the only comprehensive solution to this problem lies in international co-operation by all the parties involved, especially by the service providers. My Department is monitoring very closely ongoing European developments in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply. Is he concerned that the cross-Border group Focus on Children recently confirmed that of the 15,000 to 20,000 people worldwide who log on to see pictures of children being abused, the computer literate Irish population is, proportionately, second from the top? With regard to imposing obligations of self regulation on service providers, why is there no major publicity drive to alert parents to the fact that restrictive mechanisms can be bought relatively cheaply to deal with this problem and to block access to paedophilia or pornographic material on the Internet?</P>

I sought to examine the report but I was advised that, despite press leaks to the contrary, the report was not completed. Given the nature of the Internet, I believe the problem in this country is no worse and no better than in any other country.</P>
      <P>With regard to advising children, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, recently informed the Dáil about his initiatives in this area. I refer the Deputy to the replies the Minister gave to parliamentary questions on 24 February last. The working group concerned made specific recommendations in this area and the Minister undertook a number of initiatives.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers and which received a good deal of publicity &ndash; as if it had, in fact, been published &ndash; is not yet completed.</P>

      <P>The Minister correctly identified the need for international co-operation. What is required is international co-operation on a legislative basis. The big difficulty is that there is no international law covering the Internet. Will the Minister press for maximum co-operation on international legislation to establish a common code of practice which can be enforced uniformly throughout the world?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have the precise number of charges which have been brought under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act. However, I will ascertain the figures and communicate them to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to international law for tackling abuse of the Internet, it is important to recognise that the Internet by its nature is extremely difficult to control. It knows no national boundaries and, in some circumstances, it could be argued that it is not amenable to national law. Often, for example, service providers can unknowingly provide material on the Internet which would, in normal parlance, be regarded as an abuse of it.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's contention that the best way forward is through international co-operation. It would be almost impossible for one state on its own to tackle the problem in a meaningful way. However, the co-operation of service providers can go a long way towards giving a considerable amount of assistance. I am also aware of moves to ensure there is co-operation among European Union member states in order to tackle this serious problem. In the immediate future it is imperative that a hotline be set up in this State and that it would be funded by the service providers. I am particularly anxious that they bring forward their proposals. Having sought self regulation, they must accept there is a price to be paid for it.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent report of the Garda Complaints Board; his views on the introduction of amendments to the Garda Siochána Complaints Act, 1986, along the lines sought in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7295/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the third report of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board in relation to the operation of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986 to which the Deputy refers. I presented this report to Government last week and duly received approval to lay it before the Oireachtas and to publish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of an ongoing review mechanism, the <Col N="66" /> 1986 Act, under which the Complaints Board was established, requires the board to keep the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints under review and to report to me generally on these matters at regular intervals. The recently published report is the third such submitted by the board. In it, the board makes a number of recommendations for legislative and procedural change to improve the board's effectiveness and efficiency and to protect and enhance its independence.</P>
    <P>These recommendations number more than 30 so it is not practical to discuss each one today. However, I will mention one of the significant recommendations set out in the report. The board makes the case for it to be allowed to decide the level of supervision of its investigations on a case-by-case basis. The Act provides for general supervision of the investigation of complaints by Garda officers and this, in practice, means that the board is confined to reviewing the investigation file, once submitted.</P>
    <P>A consequence of this is that officers of the Complaints Board are effectively precluded from attending at interview between investigating officers and complainants or members of the force against whom complaints are made. This is regarded by the board as a significant deficiency in enabling it to effectively exercise its supervisory functions in regard to complaints investigation.</P>
    <P>The board, therefore, recommends that the Act be amended to allow it to decide the level of supervision in each case, which would range from the <i>status quo</i> to the direct supervision of all aspects of an investigation. In this regard, however, the board made it very clear that in exercising a right to decide on the level of supervision, it would consider that reviewing the investigation file, as is currently provided for, would be sufficient for most investigations.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this proposal is but one of many requiring detailed consideration and consultation. While the board's recommendations are wide-ranging and detailed, the broad thrust of the current legislation allows complaints against members of the Garda Síochána to be dealt with effectively and fairly. That is not to say that enhancements to the current system cannot be made where appropriate. That is what the ongoing review of the Act and its operation is all about.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations in the board's third report were included in its second triennial report and much of the analysis needed to reach conclusions on these recommendations is almost complete. I hope I will be in a position to bring proposals to Government arising from the board's recommendations in the near future. I see merit in many of the recommendations and am keen to see them implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. There are up to 30 recommendations in the <Col N="67" /> report, which he has had for up to three months. Rather than simply mention some of its more important recommendations, he should have an opinion on them. By now he should be in a position to put forward proposals on amending legislation to Government, if that is what he intends to do.</P>
      <P>The chairman's foreword to the report states that for a variety of reasons the last review was done for the 1990-92 period and part of the reason it took so long to complete the third report was insufficient staff. Does the Minister intend to provide adequate staff to rectify that deficiency?</P>
      <P>The chairman's foreword states that the board is strongly of the view that in order to properly supervise some of the most serious complaints an amendment to the Act is required. Will the Minister give a guarantee to the House that those amendments will be made speedily?</P>

I am anxious to address the concern about staffing. Recently I put forward a proposal to the Department of Finance to augment the staff.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's contention that if recommendations are to be implemented, legislation will be required. It would be premature to state categorically what kind of amendments I envisage, but we can take it as read that the Garda Complaints Board's recommendation that greater supervision is needed on a case-by-case basis requires implementation.</P>
      <P>The other recommendations are receiving careful consideration and proposals will be brought forward to the Government in due course.</P>

Will he accept the chairman's demand for more staff to enable him to do his job properly? Will he give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to that question? There are 30 recommendations in the report, but the main recommendation, which is repeated in the chairman's foreword, is that in order to deal with the most serious complaints, a change in the Act in relation to the supervision of these complaints is required. Does the Minister accept that in principle? Will he give an undertaking to the House to introduce amending legislation in due course? </P>

That is not a difficult question to answer. Will he answer it directly and not in a ponderous way? I will not go into the other 30 recommendations. I would have liked to have the time to go through one or two other points to ascertain the Minister's attitude in this regard. I would have thought that three months after receiving the report the Minister would be able to tell us the salient points with which he agrees. If amending legislation is to be produced, was it agreed by Government when he brought the report to it last week? Did he seek authorisation to bring forward amending legislation? That is the type of detail to which the House is entitled from the Minister. I do not mean to be contentious.</P>

I stated that I had made proposals to the Minister for Finance to augment the staff in accordance with a recommendation in the report of the Garda Complaint Board. I indicated to him that while it would not be appropriate for me to outline in detail what legislative amendments I will bring forward, I said that considering the examination of cases on a case-by-case basis should be looked on favourably. In those circumstances I respectfully submit that I answered the Deputy's two questions.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cost involved in providing all such escorts for movement of cash for 1998 was in the order of £5.3 million.</P>
      <P>The Garda provide escorts for movement of large sums of cash throughout the country as a crime prevention measure in order to prevent such cash falling into the hands of subversive or criminal organisations. Large sums of cash are escorted for the associated banks, An Post and some private security companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> The cost involved in escorting movements of cash to and from the associated banks was in the order of £2.1 million. The associated banks are required to make a contribution to the State in respect of Garda and Army escorts and the amount of their contribution towards the Garda Vote in 1998 was £750,000. The amount of their contribution towards the Defence Vote was £2.25 million. The level of contribution made by the banks is subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Finance and a further review will be conducted in the current year. I very much regret that substantial Garda manpower and financial resources have to be devoted to escorts of this nature.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that at a time when the banks are not only returning record profits but are boasting about them &ndash; Allied Irish Banks had a profit of £833 million and a pretax profit of £2 billion &ndash; it is wrong that the taxpayer should be asked to foot most of this bill of £5.3 million with the banks' contributing only a mere £750,000? Will he also accept that this service is a key component in the running of its operations and that the banks should be charged in full for the service provided and should be grateful that the State provides such an efficient escort service to enable them to carry out their transactions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is primarily one for the Minister for Finance but the Deputy deserves a reply to a legitimate question. It is important to emphasise that what the banks pay is a contribution to the cost of cash escorts. The additional security provided by the Garda or the Army is not determined by the banks or the security companies but is insisted upon by the State because of the consequences of large sums of money falling into the hands of paramilitary organisations or criminal gangs.</P>
      <P>The cost involved in providing Garda escorts for the movement of cash to and from the associated banks for 1998 was £2.1 million. The banks made a contribution of £3 million for costs for security provided by the Army and Garda in 1998, of which £750,000 was paid towards costs incurred by the Garda. The contribution made by the banks is meant to cover the additional costs to the State, non-paid costs such as overtime and planning costs, for providing security escorts. The current level of their contributions is subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Finance and a further review will be conducted in the current year. I have no doubt that the views expressed by Deputy Higgins will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the thrust of my argument that the costs involved are essential components, the same as electricity, postal and computer costs? It should be factored in as a cost and, therefore, as an obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the personnel involved, we are talking about two Army land rovers with three soldi<Col N="70" /> ers in each and a Garda patrol car containing two gardaí. That is a minimum of eight personnel being paid for by the Irish taxpayer. The same reply has been given by the Minister and his predecessors concerning this review every year. The banks should be charged forthwith in respect of every penny this costs. The post office, building societies and any other institution for which the State provides such a top class escort service so their cash can travel in safety should be charged in full for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course a contribution should be sought but, as I have outlined to the Deputy, a contribution is made. I accept that it is not the full cost but this matter is subject to review by the Minister for Finance and there is to be a review this year. The obligation to secure the funds in transit is imposed by the State following a decision by the Garda Síochána. I accept, however, that there is a strong case for paying for what you get.</P>

      <P>As I have previously indicated, it is my desire to publish a revised equal status Bill before the end of the Dáil's Easter recess. Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage. The revised equal status measure now being developed is on the same general lines as that found to be unconstitutional in 1997 but amended to meet the requirements of the Supreme Court. As the Deputy may recall, in its consideration of the earlier Bill, the Supreme Court did not scrutinise the entire Bill and preparation of revised equal status legislation has proved to be a more complicated process than the development of the revised employment equality legislation. It was necessary for my Department to seek extensive legal advice before proceeding with the task.</P>

I have raised this matter several times since I came into this House and subsequently the date was changed to early 1999. Then the Bill was to be introduced before Easter, as the Minister indicated was his intention. When the issue was raised on the Order of Business by Deputy Jim Higgins last Tuesday, the Tánaiste replied that it would be after Easter.

    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> There are a number of vulnerable groups which will be covered under this legislation. The fact they will be covered means they are vulnerable to discrimination and it is demoralising for those groups when the date for publication of the legislation is constantly changed.

      <P>I intend to publish the Bill before the end of the Dáil's Easter recess. It is important that I point out that while the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act were considered by the Supreme Court, only the Employment Equality Act was considered in detail and, accordingly, it was easier for us to introduce a new Employment Equality Act. I was pleased to launch the new Employment Equality Authority on International Women's Day this week. I indicated that I intended to ensure that the full Act would be brought into force on 1 September.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Act was not considered in detail by the Supreme Court although it was clear from its decision that there were at least two factors in both Acts which made the Equal Status Act unconstitutional. In those circumstances we have had to go through the Act with a fine tooth comb to bring forward a new Bill which will be upheld constitutionally. That is the only reason for the delay. I am confident that when we introduce the legislation it will stand the ultimate test.</P>

It stands in comparison with the record of my predecessor who was illustrious in the performance of his task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first report of the national steering committee on violence against women was published on Sunday, 7 March 1999 and it charts the progress made on the implementation of the recommend<Col N="73" /> ations of the task force on violence against women.</P>
      <P>Along with the establishment of the national steering committee, which was a priority recommendation of the task force, eight regional committees have been established and their remit is to provide a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency and cohesive response to women experiencing violence.</P>
      <P>The national steering committee also launched an awareness campaign which will be developed over the coming year which aims to highlight a number of issues. The focus of the campaign will be to support victims by reiterating that they should no longer suffer in silence and to inform the perpetrators that violence is a crime and it must stop. The campaign will also aim to create a wider public debate on the issue which it is hoped will encourage society generally to play a greater role in discouraging this form of violence.</P>
      <P>There are other positive developments such as the development of a computerised bed space bureau which will identify for a victim the available space within refuges. The national steering committee is also examining the introduction of a single contact helpline number for women in crisis. The aim of the helpline is to facilitate easier access to services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, following on from the publication of the discussion paper on the law and sexual offences, where the Department invited submissions from interested parties, the Minister recently received approval from Government to publish a Bill which will allow for separate legal representation for rape victims, in limited circumstances and to provide for a register of sex offenders.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the perpetrators of violence against women, funding has been made available for a community based pilot project being undertaken by the Cork Domestic Violence Project and the Probation and Welfare Service. Funding is also being provided for a pilot project men's helpline which aims to reach out to men who may be abusive or violent within a relationship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate it is difficult to cover all the progress which has been made. Copies of the report are being circulated in the House and in its appendices, the Deputy will find the recommendations from the taskforce and the replies the national steering committee received from the various Government Departments as regards progress in the first year of the steering committee.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. However, I remind her that the report of the task force on violence against women has been on her desk for two years. She has been in a position to do something about it for two years; yet, over that time 50 women have been murdered, there have been 750 reported cases of rape and sexual assault, 1,000 calls to Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and 15,000 calls nationwide, an increase of 6,000 during the Minister's two years <Col N="74" /> in office. While crime statistics are decreasing, those for rape and sexual assault are increasing. Does the Minister agree that nothing practical has been done to reduce the risk of violence and to protect women in these appalling circumstances?</P>

      <P>Why has it taken two years to get to the planning stage of the freephone helpline? It is fundamental for women suffering domestic violence that they have someone to reach out for. I find it hard to accept that it has taken two years and the establishment of a steering committee to establish a fundamental nationwide freephone service which would be of tremendous help to women suffering domestic violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the principle of what the Deputy said is correct. There is a number of helplines around the country, all of which would have to be co-ordinated. For example, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has the 1800-778888 line and Women's Aid has the 1800-341900 line, which receive thousands of calls. The operators of the various helplines do not want the excellent service provided by them interfered with, whether they are in Limerick, Galway or other areas. However, this year's allocation of £100,000 will help to establish a single phone number of which women would be aware. If a woman leaves her home in the middle of the night without money and without access to a phone book, she can dial a phone number and the operator will put her through to Women's Aid or the rape crisis centre in whatever area she is in. The allocation of £100,000 will be spent on co-ordinating and identifying a directional phone line.</P>
      <P>The report was published in April 1997 and we entered Government that summer. By December 1997 we had established the national steering committee, which was the priority of the report. Within six months, by May 1998, we established a regional committee in each of the eight health boards. That is important because gardaí, health boards and GPs were making their contribution and the voluntary sector was providing a fantastic service, through refuges, rape crisis centres etc. However, not all of these were communicating. The regional committees have enabled the co-ordination of services in each health board area. This effective co-ordination has been a huge improvement in the first year of the work of the national steering committee. Another tangible result is the record £5 million being provided this year for services for victims, which is an additional expenditure of £1 million. A great deal is happening after the first year of the national steering committee.</P>

      <P>As regards legal representation for rape victims, when will the legislation be published? Proposals have been put forward by the network of rape crisis centres in relation to the broader issue of separate legal representation. The legislation provides that sexual history be taken into account. The rape crisis centres have proposed measures that would be compliant with the Constitution in relation to how a rape victim could be kept informed of the progress of the case by one person. Has consideration been given to this proposal, which is a long standing concern of the rape crisis centres? What is the Minister of State's response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the proposals, the drafting of the Government legislation has commenced, and that will be ready as soon as possible, hopefully this year. Many issues in this area were raised following the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences published by my Department last May in which we sought submissions. <Col N="76" /> Many were received and the original closing date of the end of August was extended to the end of December. We are still receiving submissions and ideas on how barriers can be removed to improve the law in this area. The Department is keeping this constantly under review as the submissions come in, and the Minister has taken two very positive steps in the two recent announcements about legislation currently being drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging what the Minister of State has done in the past two years, I stated in my question that in spite of all those efforts the number of cases is increasing. Does the Minister of State share my concern about this? What proposals does she have for stemming the number of violent crimes against women? That is the crucial issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we are concerned by any increase in crime. While crime figures are going down, it is a huge concern to us to have an increase in this area. All of us involved in this sector would recognise that there is a historical increase in the number of cases reported to the Garda, as in the past people did not necessarily report the crimes but went to the rape crisis centre instead. That is a historical aspect to the increase, but there is no doubt that we are concerned.</P>
      <P>What are we doing about it? The awareness campaign is creating greater awareness among women victims that if they are living with the perpetrator of domestic violence, there are barring orders, safety orders and updated domestic violence legislation provisions to support them. Additional funding has been put into the various centres to provide court accompaniment, support, counselling and information for these victims. We are trying to create awareness among people that there is help available to them and that they should come forward.</P>
      <P>The biggest difficulty is that the gardaí go to a house at 3 a.m., and the woman there says she has been experiencing the same problem for 15 years and that this is the last time as she is going to do something about it. However, somewhere between then and the court date she does not go ahead with the case. We are carrying out extensive research into that attrition rate &ndash; which the first report will show &ndash; as well as domestic violence and sexual assault. We are providing advice and support as well as creating awareness among victims, perpetrators and society. Society must support victims and can no longer say that this is a family matter that people cannot get involved in; it is happening on all our streets and these victims must be supported by society. They cannot be victimised doubly, as has happened in the past.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that there is a sex offender treatment clinic only in Arbour Hill, which caters for a maximum of ten inmates only?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

Does she accept that ten treatment places is totally inadequate and a deplorable state of affairs? What will be done about it?

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plans in the Department to extend this treatment to the Curragh and to provide an additional ten places. A key part of offender treatment is that they must come forward themselves.

      <P>As I informed the House on 9 February 1999, following the sentencing of persons in connection with the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, the Garda Commissioner has appointed a senior officer at Garda superintendent level to investigate the issue of witness intimidation in this case.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report to the House on the progress of specific Garda investigations and, accordingly, I do not propose to depart from that practice now other than to say that the Garda investigation in this matter is ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dismayed that the Minister <Col N="78" /> would not be a little more forthcoming on this matter, given the absolute seriousness of this situation and the degree of frustration on all sides of the House following the sentencing of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe. It is quite exceptional.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will not answer the specific question, I have a general query; on the day the sentence was announced the Minister promised to introduce specific legislation to deal with intimidation. He promised that that would come on foot of amendments to the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which has been languishing since finishing Committee Stage on 21 October 1998. When will we see that amending legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been more than forthcoming on this matter. There was a debate in the House on the situation, and I answered fully all questions put to me. I met the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors as well as the Chief Superintendents Association to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring forward legislation dealing with the intimidation of witnesses. I will make it a specific offence to intimidate a witness, though it is already a matter of contempt of court and, as such, is punishable by considerable sanction, as Deputy Howlin will be aware. I also intend to bring forward legislation which will provide that witnesses in certain cases will be able to give video link evidence, and I also intend making it an offence for a person to try to locate witnesses who have been relocated under the witness protection programme, which I introduced shortly after becoming Minister.</P>
      <P>I am obviously very concerned that these provisions be put in place and I intend to include these in the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill currently before the House. I understand that that would require the recommittal of the legislation, which Deputy Jim Higgins pointed out. I am sure we will have the co-operation of all Members in that recommital to Committee Stage, as we cannot do so on Report Stage. I anticipate being in a position to circulate these amendments in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is somewhat extraneous to the contents of the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, which contains very important measures dealing with drug offences, procedures in criminal matters and other issues. If this issue is as important as every Member accepts, we should be seen to protect witnesses. Rather than recommit a very large Bill that would take a lot of time to deal with on Committee Stage, would it not be more appropriate to bring in this package as a special piece of legislation that could be enacted speedily with the co-operation of this side of the House? I say this in the light of another murder today and of genuine concerns about the breakdown of the law in the city. I assure the Minister of the co-<Col N="79" /> operation of this side of the House if he seeks to bring this package of proposals forward on a stand alone basis.</P>

      <P>If we simply discuss the amendments being brought forward in connection with the intimidation of witnesses I see no difficulty in getting the legislation through the House quickly. The witness protection programme is in place for witnesses who wish to go on that programme. It is not possible to force people on to the programme or to give people protection unless they are agreeable to accepting it. The decision as to whether an individual should get protection must be based on a number of factors, for example, the intelligence available to the Garda Síochána, a fear expressed by the individual concerned or both. There are no hard and fast rules in this respect. It is also the case that there may be no intelligence available to the effect that some witnesses may be intimidated. Some witnesses who do not fear intimidation may be intimidated. The Garda Síochána does its level best in the circumstances. Unfortunately neither the Garda Síochána nor I are infallible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that on 9 February when we discussed the consequences of the reduction of the charge in the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe case we predicted the clear message that intimidation works and that there would be repeats? Unfortunately our worst fears have been borne out with the shooting and attempted assassination yesterday of one of the key witnesses in a manslaughter case. Was this witness offered the services of the witness protection scheme? When will the legislation be published? We will co-operate with its speedy passage through the House, even though there are fundamental aspects of the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, with which we have difficulty. We have already argued those aspects cogently and coherently on Committee Stage. Will it be published within the next week or two weeks? I have no doubt there will be a repeat of intimidation of witnesses unless the legislation is put in place as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I indicated to Deputy Howlin that it was my intention to be in a position to circulate the amendments shortly. Deputy Howlin who professed he did not understand my first reply accepted that short reply and seemed to understand it. Deputy Higgins seems to say I was not specific enough. I cannot give a specific date but I can state categorically the legislation will be produced at the earliest possible opportunity and I am confident it will be circulated shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the witness protection pro<Col N="80" /> gramme, obviously we can and must put in place as many safeguards as possible. That is the reason I introduced the witness protection programme. It was a recognition that Irish society was as amenable to the threat of organised crime as any other society and that there was a necessity to introduce a programme of this kind. The programme is working well. Several high profile cases have already demonstrated the lengths to which members of organised criminal groups will go to frustrate the due process of law. The work of the Criminal Assets Bureau as well as the expertise of the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation will inevitably increase the number of cases which may involve the need for witness protection.</P>
    <P>I was conscious of all that on my appointment. That is the reason a dedicated witness security unit has been established in Garda headquarters under the general control and direction of the Deputy Commissioner, Crime and Security Branch. It enhances the arrangements made by the Garda to protect witnesses in exceptional circumstances. Specific funding of £250,000 was provided by the Minister for Finance for the programme. It is headed up by a chief superintendent who is responsible for all aspects of the Garda witness security programme.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Higgins's criticism of the scheme, it must be appreciated that while protection can be offered it can also be refused. With regard to the specific case yesterday, I express my deep horror and revulsion at this appalling crime. The Deputy will understand I do not want to go into any detail in relation to that matter, except to say it is being fully investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept since he informed the House on 9 February that the amending legislation would be introduced within weeks it is reasonable, four weeks later, for him to present a timeframe to the House?

      <P>I have already stated that the allegation of the intimidation of witnesses in the McCabe case is being investigated. Two of the witnesses who did not give evidence in accordance with the book of evidence in the Special Criminal Court in the trial regarding the killing of the late Detective Garda Jerry McCabe were related to one of the persons charged. Another <Col N="81" /> individual is a person to whom the people convicted of his killing allegedly returned on the morning of that killing. A considerable number of factors must be taken into account when looking at the whole issue of the intimidation of witnesses, not least of which is that it is not possible to impose a level of protection on individuals which they will not accept. The intelligence available to the Garda and the fear expressed by the individuals concerned are matters which have to be taken into account in assessing the risks.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined the legislation I will be introducing. I will give consideration to any suggestions made outside this House. Suggestions have been made by some of the Garda associations. I have undertaken to examine those in due course.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of how much legislation one might have and how well it is enforced, we are very often dealing with insidious forces which are, to say the least, quite difficult. The Garda Síochána has had outstanding success in recent times in tackling these gangs and in breaking up organised criminal gangs. That much cannot be denied but it has to be accepted in the final analysis that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the best of laws and enforcement sometimes fail to trap the perpetrators of vile acts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 69, line 26, after &ldquo;territories&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or on such other stock exchange as may be approved of by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this Chapter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to sections 24 and 25. Section 24 provides for the introduction of a scheme of dividend withholding tax, or DWT, on distributions made by Irish resident companies. Section 25 provides that those non-resident persons who are to be exempt from DWT are also to be exempt from the basic charge to Irish income tax in respect of such distributions.</P>
      <P>There are a number of categories of non-resident persons who are to be exempt from DWT and the charge to Irish income tax in respect of distributions made by Irish resident companies. One such category is non-resident companies where the principal class of the shares of the non-resident company or of its parent company is substantially and regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange in a relevant territory. A relevant territory is another EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments before the House is to extend the exemptions so as to include companies which are quoted on such other stock exchange, not located in a relevant territory, as may be approved of by the Minister <Col N="83" /> for Finance. This will enable the exemption from DWT and the charge of income tax on distributions to be granted, where appropriate, to bona fide quoted companies not covered by the existing provisions.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(f) to provide to the Revenue Commissioners an annual report on the intermediary's compliance with the agreement, which report shall be signed by &ndash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to section 24 which provides for the introduction of a scheme of dividend withholding tax, DWT, on distributions made by Irish resident companies. At present the Bill requires persons who, for the purposes of the DWT scheme, have entered into a qualifying intermediary agreement or an authorised withholding agent agreement with Revenue to provide an annual certificate from their auditors certifying their compliance with the terms of the agreement.</P>
      <P>I received representation from the Institute of Chartered Accountants on this issue. In essence, the representations were to the effect that the proposed certification requirement is impracticable because only the courts have the authority to determine what constitutes compliance and certification involves a statement of absolute certainty whereas auditors are trained to form opinions based on persuasive evidence gathered on a sample basis. I considered the points made by the institute to be reasonable and, following consultation between my officials and the institute, decided to bring forward these amendments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to change the certification requirement to a requirement that the auditor provide an annual report on the intermediary's or the withholding agent's compliance with the agreement entered into with Revenue. I consider this is a reasonable approach bearing in mind that, apart altogether from the auditor's report, the Revenue will still have the right to make its own inquiries on the question of compliance with the agreement by the intermediary or withholding agent. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 100, line 20, to delete &ldquo;tax.'.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;tax.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are concerned with the charge to income tax in respect of dividends or other distributions received from an Irish resident company by certain non-resident persons. As a general rule, a dividend paid by an Irish resident is taxable on the recipient. The dividend withholding tax provided for in section 24 is designed to collect part of the tax liability at source. The balance of tax is collected after the making of a return by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, there are exemptions from the dividend withholding tax for certain non-resident taxpayers. These include, for example, certain shareholders resident in tax treaty countries. Section 25 ensures that non-resident taxpayers who are exempted by section 24 from withholding tax are exempt from the general charge to tax in respect of the dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 26 gives effect to the EU Parent-Subsidiaries Directive which requires Ireland to give an exemption from dividend withholding tax where an Irish resident company makes a distribution to its parent company which is resident in another member state. However, no corresponding exemption from the general charge to tax exists under section 25. Amendment No. 36 aligns the provisions of sections 25 and 26 so that, where dividend by an Irish subsidiary company to its EU parent is exempted from withholding tax under section 26, it will also be exempt from the general <Col N="85" /> charter to tax under section 25. Amendments Nos. 35 and 37 are consequential drafting amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 106, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;32.&ndash;The Principal Act is hereby amended in section 118 by the insertion of the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(9) Where a body corporate incurs expense in or in connection with the provision for any of its directors or shareholders of any benefits or facilities of <Col N="87" /> whatever nature and, by virtue of this or any other statute, income tax shall not be chargeable other than by virtue of the expense being made good, then the body corporate shall notify the Revenue Commissioners each year with the details of such benefits or facilities.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Benefit-in-kind is normally a benefit which is taxed on the personal income tax of the recipient. We have discovered that under section 19 of the 1994 Act, a person who enjoys benefits conferred by a company particularly a benefit-in-kind may be deemed free of any tax liability. This amendment would place an obligation on corporate bodies to notify to the Revenue any exemptions along the lines of section 19 of the 1994 Act. There may be others in legislation with which I am not familiar and which certainly have not been brought to my attention. It would be important if the Revenue were to know what benefits of a tax free nature may be conferred on individual employees or directors by their company, and in what circumstances. That would position the Revenue to close any loopholes which may be undesirable, inequitable or unfair.</P>
    <P>In so far as section 19 of the 1994 Act is concerned, will the Minister inform us what was the tax foregone in respect of any retrospective application of the 1994 Act when it was introduced and applied? Will he also indicate what was the tax foregone in each tax year from 1994 to the present tax year, in respect of persons availing of this section? </P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this amendment appears to be to require a company to notify the Revenue Commissioners of all benefits or facilities provided by it to its directors or shareholders free of charge. Currently, the Revenue Commissioners issue annually to companies, on a selective basis, a form, P11 D, on which they must give details of all benefits given by them to their directors or employees on a free or subsidised basis. In addition, an individual must in his or her annual income tax return give details of any benefits received by him or her from his or her employer on a free or subsidised basis. Once an individual is identified by the Revenue Commissioners as receiving a benefit in kind from his or her employer, he or she will be charged income tax on an ongoing basis in respect of that benefit until the Revenue Commissioners are notified to the contrary.</P>
      <P>In relation to benefits received by shareholders, these would be treated as distributions by a company and must be included in the annual return, CTI, made by a company.</P>
      <P>I consider the current reporting arrangements for any benefits given to a director or shareholder to be adequate. In the circumstances, I must reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the details of the cost of that section, but if such is available in the Department <Col N="88" /> of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners, we will forward it to the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very helpful but he misunderstood the intention of my amendment, which is not to ensure that persons who are liable for benefit-in-kind tax on certain benefits actually pay it. The Minister referred to the tax form which is to ensure there is no evasion, but I am talking about avoidance. There are provisions in the Tax Consolidation Act which allow a person to enjoy a benefit conferred by a company, which they are quite legally entitled to enjoy because of certain provisions in the Act. There is one that I know of, which is section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994. There may be others.</P>
      <P>To ensure that there are no other loopholes in the law for avoidance of significant amounts of tax, there should be a reporting mechanism along the lines I suggest. The reporting mechanisms referred to by the Minister &ndash; both on a random basis by the company and on an individual income return by the employee, director or shareholder, as the case may be &ndash; only apply to circumstances where there is a benefit on which benefit-in-kind should be charged but is not being charged. It is a reporting mechanism to ensure that the Revenue can impose the charge.</P>
      <P>Where there are statutory exemptions from benefit-in-kind, there should be a reporting mechanism so that the Revenue can monitor them to ensure they only operate in accordance with the original intent and that there is not a large leakage of revenue.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be able to confirm to me that there are no such provisions elsewhere in the Tax Consolidation Act, other than in section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994. If the Minister is prepared to confirm that, I hope to receive the information.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has promised to provide me with information which he does not have in his brief now; that is the tax foregone to the Exchequer as a result of any retrospective element of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994, from 1982 to 1994. He has also confirmed that he will provide me with information relating to any tax foregone by persons who benefited from section 19 by claiming the relief, for each of the tax years up to the present one since it was introduced in 1994.</P>

The purpose of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994, was to give relief. At all times, in dealing with the accounts of companies the Revenue Commissioners have more than adequate powers either to assess the company and get further details from it regarding any particular matter, or to assess individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see the purpose of the amendment which Deputy Noonan has moved, except to stir up an issue which was debated here some weeks <Col N="89" /> ago and which arose from an article in one of the Sunday newspapers. It is another of these balls of smoke which we have had in recent months. It was dealt with at the time by way of a parliamentary question. There is nothing to this relief in section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994. The details surrounding the background to the introduction of the relief have been adequately provided, both by me in reply to a Parliamentary Question and by officials of the Department of Finance in briefing documents given out quite recently. There is nothing to this matter that is not already in the public domain. Everybody knows the background to this relief.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1982 a section was introduced to the Finance Act &ndash; another section 19, by coincidence &ndash; relating to the granting of income tax relief on certain expenditure concerning heritage houses. The background to this matter has been bandied around in recent weeks and I do not know why Deputy Noonan wants to keep the debate going on this matter. It is of no benefit to anybody at all. The matter has been quite adequately explained, but if we must keep having questions for the next six months, so be it. We will keep answering questions for the next six months.</P>

      <P>First of all, I do not recall any debate in this House on section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994. I remember having a debate here to do with contracts for the national lottery. The Minister may be confusing both issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>A parliamentary question is not a debate. A parliamentary question was tabled in my name to which the Minister kindly replied, but there was no debate on the issue in this House. For the Minister to suggest I am trying to raise an irrelevant issue for political purposes is unfair since I raised it discreetly by way of a parliamentary question and did not attempt to debate it in the House. I simply mentioned it on Committee Stage so that the Report Stage amendment would be in order. The Minister is being unfair to me in his reflections on the manner in which I am handling this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister went to great lengths to explain that the Revenue Commissioners, on a random basis, require companies to make returns on the benefits they may give to employees, shareholders or directors. The Minister states there are obligations on individual taxpayers to indicate the benefits they may be getting from a company when making their returns. It seems the Revenue Commissioners are very careful to ensure that benefits conferred by companies on taxpayers are subject to tax. In those circumstances, it is unprecedented, if I understand the Minister correctly, to have a provision such as section 19 of the 1994 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister telling the House that there is <Col N="90" /> only one example in law where somebody gets a major benefit from a company which is not liable to be taxed as a benefit in kind. When we match that with the information furnished in the reply to my question that only one person availed of this relief, is the Minister confirming to the House that there is only one such provision in the Consolidated Tax Acts and that there is only one beneficiary? If that is so, we would require an explanation.</P>

I am sure if I went back to last year's Finance Act I would find a dozen more examples of the non-application of benefit in kind. There is nothing unusual about a section in the Finance Act not to apply the benefit-in-kind provision to a particular person or persons or class of persons.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 41 in the names of Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and Coveney. Amendment No. 43 is related and amendment No. 42 is consequential on amendment No. 43. Amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive, will be taken together by agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 114, between lines 48 and 49, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) in section 340(2) (as inserted by the Finance Act, 1998) by the substitution in paragraph (ii) of '31st day of December, 2000' for '31st day of December, 1999'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 41 deals with enterprise zones for airports. We attempted to try to improve the situation for Cork Airport, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Airport is the only airport to have taken advantage of the airports enterprise zone scheme. <Col N="91" /> A business park, Cork Airport Business Park, is being developed at present. A potential threat to the success of the business park is the fact that the enterprise zone scheme will terminate at the end of this year. We are asking the Minister to consider extending the scheme by a further year, allowing the Cork Airport Business Park to be completed. It is hoped to have one-third of the business park completed by the summer and this will provide 500 skilled jobs, the types of jobs we are trying to attract to Cork. If the Minister could succeed in extending the scheme for a further year there is a potential that an additional 1,500 skilled jobs will be created. Cork has taken a hammering from job losses and this is particularly relevant.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment No. 43 doubles the industrial buildings tax allowance for the lessor from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. I thank the Minister for doing this. This will compensate for the loss of the double rent allowance. The essential issue is not necessarily compensation for the developer but trying to ensure that potential jobs will locate in Cork. These jobs will not come Cork's way if the Minister will not extend the scheme. It is strange that he will not do so when he has made time concessions for carpark developments, which have nothing like the same employment potential as an enterprise zone. Will the Minister reconsider our argument and accept the amendment? I know he has problems with the European Union in regard to this matter but will he do all he can to try to ensure that 1,500 jobs will come to Cork in the next year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 41 in the names of Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and Coveney proposes an extension of the qualifying period for which capital expenditure giving rise to capital allowances can be incurred in the airport enterprise areas covered by the 1997 Finance Act from the end of 1999 to the end of the year 2000.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to accede to this proposal. The EU approval of February 1998 for the enterprise areas covered by the 1997 Finance Act was conditional on the expenditure being terminated for capital allowance purposes at the end of 1999. Consequently, in last year's Finance Act it was necessary to change the termination date for the tax reliefs for the 1997 Finance Act enterprise areas from 30 June 2000 &ndash; as it was in that Act &ndash;  to 31 December 1999 in compliance with EU Commission requirements. It is obvious, therefore, that there can be no question of extending the period as is being called for in the Deputies' amendment.</P>
      <P>I am unable to accept amendment No. 41. Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 in my name also relate to the enterprise areas adjacent to the regional airports. These amendments concern the year 1 capital allowances which are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of premises used by qualifying companies in those enterprise areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> As originally provided for in the 1997 Finance Act, the capital allowances are 25 per cent in Year 1 and 4 per cent per annum for the next 19 years. That Act also provided that these airport enterprise areas would benefit from the double rent relief. However, this double rent relief as well as rates relief were ruled out by the EU Commission in 1998 for the airport enterprise areas.</P>
    <P>In the light of the loss of these two reliefs, I have reviewed the position of these airport enterprise areas and have concluded that there is a good case for increasing the year 1 capital allowances and I propose to do so by these amendments. As a result, the year 1 or initial allowance is being increased to 50 per cent, compared to 25 per cent, with the balance of expenditure being written off at 4 per cent per annum over the next 13 years. This doubling of the year 1 allowance is particularly important for investors-lessors of the qualifying buildings in the airport enterprise areas.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised informally with the EU Commission in the past few days and it gave rise to no problem from their point of view. An increase in the initial allowance to 50 per cent strengthens the &ldquo;investment aid&rdquo; character of the allowance.</P>
    <P>My amendments, which enhance the year 1 capital allowances from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, are as much as can be contemplated for the airport enterprise areas and this represents a significant response to requests for easements in this area having regard to the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EU Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for going some distance to meet the essence of the amendment, as Deputy Coveney has a particular interest in job creation at Cork Airport enterprise zone. Cork has had the difficulty of job losses in Apple Computers. Although our economy is moving forward and never were more jobs created than in the last couple of years, there are still local and regional difficulties. There will be rapid changes of jobs in some circumstances, certain industries will prosper and others will not, and people can look forward to many changes of job in their lives. It is important that a package of incentives appropriate to a region should be in place, not least the incentives attached to the regional airports, in particular to Cork Airport.</P>
      <P>The Minister has moved some way to meet these needs by allowing a 50 per cent write off in the first year. What is the arrangement for the subsequent years? I understand it was 25 multiplied by 19 multiplied by 4 per cent&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification. The Minister is right to move in this way on capital allowances. In recent months the impression has been given that we are losing all capacity to direct investment to particular deprived areas but that is not the case. European competition rules provide for investment aid but the ongoing assistance towards rent and rates is causing problems. Do the additional concessions for capital allowances, which the Minister has made today, only apply until the end of this year? If so, is there any reason in principle for the European Commission to refuse to extend that deadline? In his initial response the Minister said it had been agreed some years ago that the closing date capital allowances for the airport enterprise zones would be the end of this year. Is there any reason that should not be extended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy McDowell, we obtained approval for the enterprise area zones, including those for airports, only in February 1998, even though they were announced in the 1997 budget and the Finance Act of that year. To address Deputy Coveney, the agreement specified that capital allowances would only apply until 31 December 1999. The date cited in the Finance Act, 1997 was 30 June 2000 but in last year's Finance Act, in order to comply with our written agreement with the EU on the enterprise zones, I had to bring the date forward to the end of this year. The amendment asks me to change the date to 31 December 2000, for good reasons which the Deputy outlined on Committee Stage and again today. It is not possible to do that because the agreement with the Commission which allows us to go ahead with that scheme specifies 31 December 1999. I am therefore not in a position to extend the closing date as per the amendment.</P>
      <P>That being the case, the Deputy legitimately and sensibly asked why relief for multi-storey car parks extended until 31 December 2000. We have not yet received permission from the Commission to introduce capital relief for car parks so we have fixed that date and will see how matters progress.</P>

      <P>The way things are going, Europe often says no. Apropos of the previous debate with Deputy Noonan, perhaps only one lessor will benefit from this and if a tribunal is set up in ten years' time to inquire why I increased the allowance from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, the Deputies present may have to appear before it. I hope other people come to our aid and the <Col N="94" /> Deputies should be prepared. I hope they remember where they were on 10 March 1999 and whom they had lunch with in previous weeks. I will not be able to recall that but perhaps they will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept that double rent relief and rates allowance will not be available to future projects, whatever the rights and wrongs of that may be. However, if the Commission has accepted the use of capital allowances in enterprise zones, there is no reason in principle not to extend it for another year or two. Given the delay in receiving approval and starting projects, surely the Commission must accept that there is a genuine problem which prevented us making use of the agreement reached last year.</P>

      <P>The agreement we reached in February 1998 on enterprise zones was a general agreement but, as I pointed out in the debate on last year's Finance Act, we must make applications for specific projects and therefore must go back to the Commission to apply for the Cork Airport project. In that context we can raise the possibility of extending the closing date of 31 December this year. As was pointed out last year, approval for airport enterprise zones is given on a case by case basis. The Cork project is the only one which is up and running to date and when we return to seek approval for it we can raise the possibility of extending the deadline.</P>

      <P>In page 118, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;44.&ndash;The Principal Act is hereby amended in section 372L of Chapter 8 (as inserted by the Finance Act, 1998) by the substitution in the definition of &lsquo;qualifying rural area' of &lsquo;means any area described in Schedule 8A' by &lsquo;means any area described in Schedule 8A or any other area which the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government (which recommendations shall take into consideration an economic plan for the area submitted by a local authority or a company established by a local authority and prepared by the local authority in co-operation with any other groups in the area which are funded by the Exchequer or the European Union and which are charged with promoting economic development in the area, to that Minister in respect of an area identified by it), by order direct that the area or areas described (being wholly located within the boundaries of the area to which the Economic Plan relates) in the order shall be a qualifying area for the purpose of one or more sections of this Chapter'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Whatever the result of the negotiations in Europe to achieve Objective One status for 13 counties, or for the 15 counties which were the subject of the submission, it seems clear that the remainder of the country will have the status of Objective One in Transition. Within that part of the country there are large areas of poverty which are underdeveloped and rapidly losing population. If the Minister accepts this amendment he would have power to designate other parts of the country which would enjoy the same benefits as the upper Shannon designation. This would allow the Minister to address one of the issues that has been highlighted in debates on the Government's regionalisation programme, namely, how to deal with blackspots which have an equally strong case for Objective One status as the counties already included in the Government's plans. Is there a Government policy to address this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various Deputies have highlighted the prob<Col N="96" /> lems of urban blackspots, but amendment No. 44 seeks to establish a mechanism to allow the Minister to address the problem of rural blackspots at some future date. The Minister is familiar with the situation in rural areas, particularly in County Kildare, but it is interesting to see what is happening in counties, such as the one in which I live, which have a reputation for having good farmland.</P>
    <P>Farming people are the salt of the earth and they have a great commitment to education. It is seldom that a boy or girl from a farming family will drop out of school; they all complete the leaving certificate and many of them go on to college, at which point, having qualified, they make certain choices. Invariably, they choose not to return to the family farm and to seek employment in industry. Many of these young people move to our cities, particularly Dublin, but quite a number of them make either a temporary or permanent move abroad. They are making choices which ensure the fabric of rural Ireland is in decline.</P>
    <P>I could take the Minister to parishes in east Limerick and walk with him along roads where, up to ten years ago, between 20 to 25 farmers supplied milk to the creameries but where now only two or three farms remain in operation while the remaining land is being leased out. Another feature of this development is that professional and business people from the cities are moving out to a wider commuter belt, purchasing 25 to 30 acres of quotaless land, constructing a house and keeping a few head of dry cattle and a pony for their children. They are making lifestyle choices and, in the absence of people who are economically committed to rural Ireland, I will not criticise them for being socially and residentially committed to rural Ireland. However, the entire structure of rural society is changing.</P>
    <P>Listening to Ministers other than Deputy McCreevy, one gets the impression that the Government is following a strategy where the decline of rural areas will be compensated for by the development of villages. However, I have yet to see serious initiatives of a policy nature directed at village development. Even the provision of small water and sewerage schemes, which would be essential to the clustering of people in villages to compensate for the decline in the wider countryside, is not taking place.</P>
    <P>While I am sure there will be a great deal of comment about the result of upcoming negotiations, led by the German Presidency, on the Santer proposals and attempts to reform the CAP, it is a mistake to believe rural decline and the decline in agriculture as an industry are synonymous because there are wider issues involved. The only hope for many of the rural areas to which I refer &ndash; whether it be the Ballyhoura region, which stretches from Cork to east Limerick, or the Sliabh Luachra region, which takes in the borders of Cork, Kerry and west Limerick &ndash; will be the implementation of integrated development plans led by the kinds of reliefs the Minister has applied in the upper Shannon area. A combi<Col N="97" /> nation of green tourism, small industry and knowledge based activity, in conjunction with the residue of a stronger farming industry, based on larger holdings with less people involved, represents the way forward.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government moves in that direction large rural areas will be reduced below the point of what I term &ldquo;critical social mass&rdquo;. When a community reaches that level it dies. By using the term &ldquo;critical social mass&rdquo; I refer to rural areas where there is no longer any social life, where young people lack sufficient companionship to enjoy themselves locally and where the fun is in the party town, namely, Dublin. The attractions offered by Dublin and other urban centres is draining the countryside of its life. Once the population drops below a certain level, young people no longer stay and older people become more isolated and try to move into villages or nursing homes. Fear and loneliness are two of the main factors in the decline of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unless compensatory policies are put in place to arrest the decline to which I refer, we will be left with an unbalanced country. On reading this morning's newspapers, reflecting on the Bacon Report or considering the problem of the housing shortage in Dublin &ndash; Members will be familiar with the fact that 18,000 new houses in north County Dublin are to be connected to temporary sewerage systems &ndash; I wonder if the city would come under as much pressure if we took account of from where the people demanding these houses are coming? We must remember that certain rural areas will become landscape reservations or regions of extensive flora and fauna unless action is taken.</P>
    <P>Not since the Famine has there been such decline in rural areas. One need only travel outside the commuter belts surrounding our main towns to witness that decline. I am more familiar with the situation in County Limerick and the last census of population showed increases in every parish within 12 miles of Limerick city. However, beyond that circumference and in areas of west Limerick, there has been a decline in population in every parish. Combined with changes in farming practice, that is making a huge difference.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggests that, by regulation, the Minister should take the power to designate as he sees fit. When the decision taken in Brussels is announced, this will arm him with a mechanism to at least provide assistance to the blackspots in rural areas which require intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment from the perspective of people living in rural areas. We are losing the battle for rural Ireland. Despite the most recent initiatives from Europe, which included the Leader programme, we have failed to come to terms with the major problems of rural decline, depopulation, the loss of services in rural areas, etc. We are losing the battle despite the existence of so many well intentioned programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members who represent rural constituencies <Col N="98" /> are aware that many of these areas have a short time left to live. Many houses in rural areas are occupied by single people or married couples whose children have left home and are not likely to return because there is no incentive for them to do so. There are people living in isolated areas whose houses are serviced by very poor roads. Investment in basic sanitary services, such as water mains and sewerage, in rural areas and villages has been low. This has led to the decline to which I refer, which will be difficult to arrest.</P>
    <P>Unless alternative activities are introduced to rural areas, those areas will continue to decline and, in many cases, townlands will be wiped out. The amendment will give the Minister the opportunity, in consultation with local authorities, to pinpoint specific areas within counties which are in a permanent or terminal state of decline. For example, places such as Tarbert and Ballylongford in north-east Kerry were very prosperous until five years ago when the effects of Moneypoint, Aughinish Island and Tarbert ESB station began to be felt. These areas contained vibrant communities but they are now in decline because people are abandoning farming. There is a need for a tax incentive to attract a new range of activities. Other approaches have to be looked at. As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, I established a special strategy group on rural development. One of its key recommendations was that tax incentives should be targeted at specific rural black spots. The amendment would offer alternatives to local and would be investors, now that the number of tax shelters has been minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be an intelligent debate about rural development, at least one fact has to be accepted. Whatever the rights or wrongs, the number working on the land and living on farms will continue to diminish for the foreseeable future. While my party supports the provision of direct payments to farmers to make marginal farms more viable, there are many farms which are not viable and do not offer the standard of living nowadays expected.</P>
      <P>Those fleeing the land are moving to the cities, Dublin in particular. It must be made viable for them to move to their nearest village or town. This requires an integrated approach and means that post offices will have to be provided in areas where their viability is marginal and schools in areas where there are only one or two teachers as well as the social and recreational facilities people are entitled to expect.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue which demands selectivity. It would not be effective to apply the rural renewal scheme in large swathes of the country. That would defeat the purpose of the exercise. There is no point in encouraging people to move to towns which are increasing in size, such as Letterkenny, Ennis or Castlebar. There is a need to ensure they remain in Ennistymon or Buncrana. Any measures introduced would have to be targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> When the issue was debated last year the Minister confirmed that it was his intention to rely on liaison with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and reports and plans prepared by regional and local authorities. A system has to be put in place. With all due respect, officials in the Department of Finance or elsewhere are not necessarily conferred with total wisdom in these matters. The areas which should be eligible for this relief should be decided selectively. The scheme set out in the amendment is reasonable. It provides for a consultative process with regional and local authorities and for the Minister to act on the recommendations of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of altering the length of the qualifying lease to attract relief from 12 months to three months. This appears to be designed specifically to encourage the construction of holiday homes. I am not certain that is the type of development required in the Shannon basin or elsewhere. Why has the Minister moved within a relatively short period to reduce the length of the qualifying lease? </P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to enlarge the definition of &ldquo;qualifying rural area&rdquo; for the purposes of the reliefs provided for in Chapter 8 of Part 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, introduced by section 77 of the Finance Act, 1998. In addition to the areas listed in Schedule 8A to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, that is, all of counties Leitrim and Longford as well as certain specified areas in counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo, the amendment envisages certain other areas which might be recommended to the Minister for Finance by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This recommendation, in turn, would have regard to an economic plan for the area submitted by a local authority or a company established by a local authority. It is proposed that an economic plan would be prepared by the local authority in co-operation with certain Exchequer or EU funded groups in the area which are charged with promoting economic development.</P>
      <P>The structure proposed in the amendment for defining qualifying rural areas is akin to that used for identifying qualifying areas in the context of the urban renewal scheme introduced in the 1998 Finance Act. There is a crucial difference, however, between the two schemes in that the urban renewal arrangements apply, subject to conditions, to urban areas countrywide whereas the rural renewal initiative is a pilot project focused on a limited and specifically defined part of the country and aimed at parts of the upper Shannon region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To follow the line proposed in the amendment could result in rural areas in all parts of the country coming within the scope of the rural renewal initiative. This would be incompatible with the proposals for rural renewal as envisaged when I <Col N="100" /> announced the scheme. I stated clearly at the time the area in which the new arrangements would apply, that is, the upper Shannon region. There are other areas which would benefit from this type of incentive package but, as I explained in my Budget Statement in December, I am still awaiting European Commission clearance for the business tax incentives element of the scheme. The residential incentives element has been in operation since 1 June 1998. This clearance has not yet come through but when it does I will examine the possibility of extending the pilot scheme to other rural areas on a targeted basis.</P>
    <P>The rural renewal scheme was notified to the European Commission in mid-September 1998 having been discussed on a number of occasions earlier in the year. The European Commission replied on 19 November with comments and several detailed questions. The matter was discussed at a meeting in mid-February. A reply was sent on 5 March and its response is awaited.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for many of the remarks made by Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and McDowell. Deputy Noonan indicated that the population of rural areas in County Limerick has decreased while the population of Limerick city is increasing apace. The 1991 and 1996 censuses of population show that the population of County Kildare is increasing at European record rate. It increased from 120,000 in 1991 to 135,000 in 1996. This camouflages the fact that the population of many district electoral divisions and townlands has decreased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the Bacon report, published yesterday, on foot of which initiatives will be taken to increase the supply of housing in certain parts of Dublin. I have a difficulty as an elected representative for County Kildare where various groups are opposing, for good reasons, further development in certain towns and villages. There are other areas crying out for development. If I had delayed last year and appointed a task force consisting of officials of my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and various other groups to consider a tax scheme for rural renewal it would still be meeting and would probably decide against the idea for the good reason put forward by those in my Department and elsewhere that it is difficult to draw the boundaries to such a scheme. Similar objections were put forward to the seaside resort renewal scheme which originated when I was Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>In view of this I decided on a pilot project based on the upper Shannon region. As Deputy Deenihan has pointed out, recommendations regarding such tax incentives for rural Ireland were included in various reports compiled by some of the groups to which he referred. Some of them may have been produced when he was Minster of State at the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. With that knowledge and knowing also the difficulties in resisting calls for an extension countrywide, I proceeded with this scheme on a pilot basis last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> We have not as yet obtained EU approval for business incentives in those areas. Aware of this last year, I decided to commence with the residential reliefs. I have no compelling evidence to date as to whether it has been a success. I have introduced changes in this Bill to owner reliefs. I have also reduced the letting period from 12 months to three and have allowed an increase in the square footage of owner occupied houses. I received representations to implement some of these measures.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the reduction in the release period. For example, some people might be afraid it may lead to a proliferation of holiday homes in County Leitrim. I do not know if this will happen. I travel to that part of the country on a regular basis, more than to any other, and I would be delighted to see any activity in some of the counties in the region.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to families living in rural areas. We may soon end up driving around the country from the big towns and villages on Sunday afternoons to see the people living in what will be, more or less, a reservation. There would be vast wildernesses devoid of people where the fauna and flora could be explored. There are advocates of this approach, though not in this House, who reside in parts of Dublin and subscribe to certain newspapers.</P>
    <P>However, I was born in the heart of rural Ireland and lived in a lock house on a canal bank which was miles from any village. I have seen what has happened in rural areas of County Kildare. In the area in which I lived many people are now buying plots of land and maintaining a rural presence. When I lived there people worked from small farms and there were farmhouses every few yards. None are working on farms at present. The sons and daughters of those on landholdings as small as 25 acres were educated at UCD. Most of them were migrants from the west or south of Ireland who showed people in County Kildare how to work and put their children through college when there was very little money around. Most of it was earned through dairy farming. Their houses are still there but the owners now have a very nice lifestyle on perhaps 25 acres of land, with perhaps a few cattle or a pony or two for their children.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland has changed. Notwithstanding the disadvantages from the tax viewpoint etc., it is worth taking a chance with this pilot project. If a person is brave enough to attempt to generate economic activity in the upper Shannon region, say in County Leitrim, I wish him or her the best of luck. I cannot say if it will be a success, but I hope it will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also referred to the Ballyhoura region from west Limerick to north Cork. I met the group concerned and was impressed with their approach to integrated development. It was not merely concerned with designating an area and then waiting to see what will happen, rather it was a well thought out development proposal. If or when we get EU permission and when I get <Col N="102" /> a further assessment on the pilot programme in the upper Shannon region I will consider matters further because I see merit in Deputy Noonan's proposal to extend it to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is very little about Deputy Noonan's discourse on rural Ireland with which I disagree. It has been happening in the country for some time. For the reasons outlined by Deputy McDowell and others, which include income levels and EU developments, farming will be in decline. However, there are other reasons people have left rural Ireland. I do not suggest the upper Shannon pilot project will solve all the problems, but if it is a success we may perhaps extend it to other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;or exchanging anecdotes about the hard youth we had. Most of the argument about the decline in rural Ireland is presented on the basis of a lack of economic activity. Deputy Deenihan and I no longer consider that to be true. The main factor now is the lack of a social milieu to enable people to continue to live there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The young are no longer staying there because of the lonesomeness, the lack of company, the drabness and the lack of vibrancy and activity, especially in the months from September to June. Any plan that addresses this will be of benefit and any strategy which keeps people in the parish is effective. People do not have to earn their living from economic activity generated in the parish. Perhaps a third of them may do so. There is nothing wrong with commuting as long as there are vibrant families. Nor is there anything wrong with holiday homes if people travel to them at weekends. They also add vibrancy. There could be a descending order of priorities with regard to keeping places alive and maintaining a critical social mass. It will subsequently generate an economic mass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county councils are applying policies with the best of intentions but they are running counter to the restoration of life in rural areas. They have taken seriously the advice of the Department of the Environment and Local Government that only sustainable development should be maintained. However, it is impossible to get planning permission in parts of rural Ireland. I understand the difficulties in preserving a pure water <Col N="103" /> supply and that the water table can only sustain so many septic tanks. There is no point telling people they can build in the village when they will not get planning permission for a septic tank or there is no sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>There are two types of villages in Ireland &ndash; the linear village, which is built along the road between the speed limits, and the nodal or cluster village, which is the remnant of a planned village of the 19th century. Part of the strategy should be to turn linear villages into nodal villages. As Deputy Deenihan remarked when the Minister was replying, there is a field between the end of every development in a town and the speed limit. The council at its best will give permission to build three houses along the front of that field, but there could be six acres behind that which are totally sterilised from development. There would be better development if small sewerage schemes were put in place.</P>
    <P>If the planning policy is that houses cannot be built on once-off sites in the countryside, the <i>quid pro quo</i> must be that people can live in the villages. However, planning policy is making it impossible for anyone, other than close relatives, to build in some country parishes. Unless a person can prove a close family relationship with the landowner, they will not be able to build. This is driving people into urban areas.</P>
    <P>As the man who holds the key to the purse strings, if not the purse strings, I ask the Minister to ensure the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is given a Supplementary Estimate for water and sewerage schemes in villages. A limit could be put on the size of the villages; I am not talking about towns.</P>
    <P>This decline is real. I was talking to a friend recently who is an auctioneer in a village in County Limerick which looks prosperous. I asked him if there was anything for sale. He said the entire street was for sale on his books but the old families were embarrassed to put up the signs. The notices would not be seen in the newspapers or the auctioneers' windows. Villages reflect the farms. There are many old shopkeepers and publicans, some of whom open only for a few hours each day for company. The economic activity would not sustain a living.</P>
    <P>This decline across rural Ireland is not being addressed or is being addressed in the wrong way. People say they will put advance factories into these areas. That does not work anymore. The people who want to live in these areas are prepared to commute to the local industrial estate to work, even if it is 20 miles away. Consultants are always good at spinning a line, such as stating that in a modern age an on-line IT industry could be located in Cappamore, for example. We could build a mountain there as well, put artificial snow on it and turn it into a ski resort. The solutions must be related to the difficulty. The Minister will get better advice from the Deputies than from most people on what is happening in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The problem is not economically but socially driven. That is why the young people are leaving rural Ireland and the older people want to move into houses for the elderly beside community centres. That is why many old people are moving to their sons and daughters in the cities. It is the loneliness, the lack of vibrancy and the fact the population has dropped below the critical social mass that is driving people away. The next phase is the closure of the school, the Garda barracks and the post office which leads to the economic decline of the parish.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that in the last years of the millennium, when the economy has not been better at a macro level, there is more decline in the rural areas than ever before. When people were poorer they were more sane. It is ironic that people are being educated out of their environments and their skills levels cannot be satisfied where they were born and reared. In addition, there is the problem of the social expectations of the rising population. There is no match between the difficulty and the policies being applied by the local authorities and Departments.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the concern in the film industry about the future of section 481 tax relief for investment in film production. This has been extended for just ten months in this Bill pending, as the Minister said on Second Stage, consideration of special studies on film relief to be published by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This has led to widespread uncertainty at all levels of the industry.</P>
      <P>Section 481, previously referred to as section 35, has been an invaluable instrument in the growth of the Irish film industry, especially in the indigenous production sector, in recent years. It allows Irish producers to approach the international market with a proportion of their budget in place, which is a great advantage. This is a key element in triggering foreign investment in the form of pre-sales and co-production finance. It is also treated as the Irish producer's equity which allows the producer ownership in the film, thereby providing potential for future revenue from foreign sales.</P>
      <P>As the incentive can be used only by producers who have raised a significant amount of their budgets in the form of international pre-sales, the focus on film financing is on developing and maintaining a strong orientation towards the international market. This has created an outward looking and internationally aware independent production sector with a high product standard. It has helped to create strong links and co-operation between the film production sector and the financial sector and generated expertise in the area of international film finance.</P>
      <P>These amendments support the renewal and enhancing of section 481 for a number of reasons. The enhancement of the existing incentives will enable indigenous production companies to develop business plans over the medium and long-term. Output would be increased and mechanisms organised to encourage proper and systematic project development as well as strategies formulated to retain programme and film rights. Improvements would encourage film-related services, including the provision of studio facilities and post-production companies, to plan for growth and investment in their businesses. Allowing tax relief on expenditure up to 100 per cent will encourage the emergence of additional studio sound post-production and laboratory facilities with the benefits of additional employment and economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the film industry has been doing well, some facilities leave a lot to be desired. The post-production facilities, for example, are non-existent. We do not have studio facilities which reflect an emerging vibrant industry. Providing stability <Col N="106" /> for the industry, which these amendments would ensure, would copperfasten the process of recent years in the crucial area of talent development and would encourage people, such as directors, writers, producers, actors, etc., to stay here to work rather than going abroad. Irish producers have fostered the growth of this talent and must be able to hold on to it.</P>
    <P>Given the sensitivity of the sector to exchange rate fluctuations and increasingly attractive incentives available in other countries, the improvements in the incentives will give Ireland a competitive edge which it is in danger of losing. The United Kingdom has enhanced its film incentives and, as a result, American producers in particular, who previously looked to Ireland, are now seriously considering England as a location because of its enhanced incentives for film making. The UK lost out to Ireland in terms of &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; and other films. The Labour Government decided to put in place a whole new package of incentives for film makers which have been successful.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty created by the Minister's decision to renew section 481 for one year, which has been highlighted by overseas competitors, of which there are many, is sending out the wrong message to the international film community in terms of our commitment to film making in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say he is awaiting the publication of the think tank report on film making but uncertainty has been created and I am sure he got some feedback on that from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands following her launch of the Irish Screen Commission in Los Angeles. There is a perception that the Government is not committed to the film industry but if the Minister accepts our amendments, he would be sending out the right signal. If he wants to enhance the various incentives to the industry, following acceptance of our amendments, he can do that.</P>
    <P>This is a competitive field and I do not have to remind the Minister of the benefits of the industry. He is well aware of them as there is a spin-off even for his own constituency. Approximately 4,000 people are employed directly in the film industry. I know a number of people working in the industry. We recently set up a film commission in Kerry to attract people to Kerry to make films, although there is a difficulty with the SIPTU 40 mile rule which has not been a concern of ours to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister should allow a three year extension of section 481 and the full tax relief of 100 per cent. If he is not prepared to do that, allowing a three year extension will not distort his figures in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this group of amendments, particularly amendment No. 50 in the name of my colleague, Deputy McDowell, which asks the Minister to extend the time period. There is insufficient perception of what will hap<Col N="107" /> pen when the period of time in which tax incentives are available for film is reduced to 12 months. When I visited Los Angeles and toured most of the major studios as Minister with responsibility for film, it was clear that regardless of whether one was making films, the construction of a project of financing took at least 18 months. Against my advice at that time, and on the insistence of others, the relief was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent. Even more important to me than the reduction to 80 per cent was that we were able to retain the period of three years in which people could plan, put finance together and become committed to different film projects.</P>
      <P>When the first Indecon report on the film industry was carried out it seemed that it changed course during the preparation of the study in terms of some of its assumptions. That report was the basis for the agreed strategy between the Department of Finance and myself, as Minister. When we established a three year period, I felt we were ensuring some investment. I emphasise to the Minister, by way of being helpful, that this is particularly important in relation to external corporate investment that used to be made under section 35. It is impossible to get that investment within a 12 month period.</P>
      <P>The most recent report from Film Makers Ireland shows that what is foregone by way of tax which it is assumed would have been paid is exceeded by that which is generated by way of spend and, in turn, income to the State. Other factors which will appear tedious to some is that this is very much regionalised expenditure. When one goes over a budget of £500,000 on a film, one is talking about 52 skills. This work is heavily regionalised. In the course of my time, 14 counties participated in the spend on film. It is a clean industry and the most important component of it, the building block that is Bord Scannán na hÉireann, when it was revived, worked on two furrows at the same time, namely, the contribution of film to culture and developing certainty in relation to the film industry. There was a valuable interaction between the new young skilled directors and camera people coming from the indigenous sector who were finding opportunities of working in big budget films.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan mentioned &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;. There were 11 assistantships on that film and the expenditure in the Irish economy was about 85 per cent of the total budget of the film. I find it sad that &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; was the first film I certified and &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; was the last. When I remember the projected expenditure of these films and the effect they had on different parts of the economy, we should be driving the film industry rather than putting a brake on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest anyone think it is responsible to say that now that the film industry is doing well we should leave it alone, assumptions in relation to film have been wrong in the past. They were wrong about the Irish Film Board in the 1980s and they <Col N="108" /> were wrong about the early version of section 35. The growth in the spend, from £11 million in 1992, was 3,400 per cent. It is interesting to note the reason those assumptions were wrong. They had assumed that films do not make money, that they are not services like the services we have constituted previously &ndash; I frequently listened to that argument. The other reason is that film is not really an industry like the industry we were competent in promoting. Occasionally people would say to me that if it were that good, the IDA would have been involved years ago. The IDA did not become involved years ago. Other people tried to do it but they were unsuccessful. We had a model which was the envy of Europe and of the world.</P>
    <P>There is a revolution in cinema taking place throughout the world. There is an expansion of what is possible in the English speaking world. About 78 per cent of all the net profits made in the 15 per cent of film that is successfully commercially distributed are in the English speaking world. Mrs. Thatcher, who did not like films, succeeded in reducing the gross spend on film in Britain from about £600 million when she took office to £400 million when I took office. She managed to contract the industry. We moved to a point where we were somewhere between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the British capacity.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that we are not using that as a building block for moving into the new environment where there are opportunities in terms of earnings, jobs and the creative representation of the country. A huge number of tourists come to Ireland because they have seen a film made here. We are putting a precarious plank beneath what was a good scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a reasoning which I respect which can be brought to bear, regardless of whether I agree with it, in relation to other items of tax foregone or in terms of public expenditure. However, in this instance it is wrong to limit this facility to a 12 month period. It is incomprehensible that when I left office in June 1997 and everybody claimed it was time to bring the hard nosed industry people back into the sector &ndash; a working group was to be established &ndash; it did not appear to matter that STATCOM had been there already. STATCOM included representatives of all semi-State bodies involved in film such as the Film Board, the IDA and FÁS.</P>
    <P>However, it was claimed that a new industry group was required. My successor wanted to be advised by a new group and then by another new group. Then the two Ministers wanted to be advised again by a consultant. Why could they not, in two years, have arrived at the opinion that they wanted to continue the scheme, replace it or put another scheme in its place?</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, suggests, the Government could have the best possible result if it states it will stay with the film industry until the year 2010, that is, taking something that is successful and treating it the same as other <Col N="109" /> industry, from which the Government gets many different benefits.</P>
    <P>I really do not know what more I can say. This has been one of the most exciting developments in Irish life. There is no country of the 15 in the European Union where more than 12 per cent of the population watch films made by themselves. Over 90 per cent of the product comes from the United States. It is the second biggest industry radiating into Europe from North America. In this rich market we are turning that around by inviting new and exciting directors and combining something that is artistic and cultural with an immensely successful commercial scheme. A British House of Commons group visited Ireland to examine the scheme and our advice is sought by several countries on how to set up a similar scheme. Yet we now decide to fire it into an atmosphere of uncertainty and allocate just one more year for that success to continue.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister to remove this uncertainty. Even if he will not increase the 80 per cent deduction to 100 per cent, as has been suggested, he should at least provide for the necessary period of time to give security to something that has been revived and is successful.</P>

      <P>This case has been well made by Deputies Deenihan and Higgins. There has been a great deal of confusion about this issue. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands said in Los Angeles on 24 February, when she launched the Irish Screen Commission:</P>
      <P>If you ask me about the longer term future of section 481 as an element of Ireland's strategic plan for the industry into the next decade, I consider that it will continue to play a crucial role. I envisage that the scheme will continue to be a critical element of the strategy that will be developed by my Government following consideration of the report and recommendations of the strategic review group.</P>
      <P>That clearly implies to American investors in the film industry who would consider investing in major films here that section 481 will be available throughout the next decade. If it is based in real terms on a contribution of about 11 per cent to the overall cost of a major film and if it is also based on top level taxpayers investing in it, the reduction of top taxation levels will mean the value to the investor will be reduced. As it is a risky business, it will not be as attractive as it was heretofore. That is the case being made for the increase from 80 per cent to 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>People involved in this business who speak to potential investors in the film industry are aware that there is a longer lead in time than one year to securing the budgetary commitments required. It is a weak product. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands stood before the American film industry and spoke about this attractive incentive. She gave the clear impression that it will play a crucial role in the next decade. However, it is only provided for 12 months in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> When answering parliamentary questions yesterday, the same Minister said there was no reason section 481 could not be enhanced further and that other changes might be introduced. The strategic review group recommended in its interim report that this is a feasible proposition and that it should continue. We can assume the final report will either confirm that or offer an enhanced version of the recommendation.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. Film Makers Ireland appeared before the committee and made a strong, cogent case on this issue. We are following up its case in these amendments. The Minister is a practical person. I read the consultants' recommendation of a ten year period. If taxation levels are reduced over that period, it will not be as attractive as it was. A two year extension is warranted and would be worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are related to section 58 of the Bill which deals with tax relief for investment in films.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 47, 49 and 52 in the names of Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and Kenny and amendments Nos. 48, 50 and 53 in the name of Deputy McDowell seek to extend the tax relief for investment in films by three and 11 years, respectively. However, section 58 extends the relief for one year only.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to developing the film industry. To this end, the relief is currently being reviewed by the film industry strategic review group, the think tank set up by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. While awaiting the recommendations of this group, I am only prepared to extend the tax relief for one year.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 51 in the name of Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and Kenny seeks to grant a 100 per cent deduction rather than the current 80 per cent deduction granted for corporate investment in films. This restriction was introduced in 1996 by the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government following the recommendations of the previous review of the film relief. As part of that review, independent consultants were hired who published their results after an extensive study involving consultation with various practitioners. Their view was that at the strategic level, one would have to question the sustainability of an industry which was so vulnerable that it could not survive an 80 per cent deduction rather than a 100 per cent deduction.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, I am not prepared to make any substantial amendments to the current film relief until the think tank makes its report. In these circumstances, I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>I noted the contributions of all Deputies, particularly Deputy Higgins who has first hand experience in this area. However, there must be a certain degree of equity among taxpayers. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will publish the report in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> This relief is a beano for investors; I do not know if it is the same beano for the film industry. On 5 March, <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the headline &ldquo;Film is star attraction for investors on tax-shelter trail&rdquo;. According to that article, one of the most thriving tax shelters this year is money invested in film production. The article continues:</P>
    <P>While returns cannot be guaranteed, risk is significantly reduced when the production company has been commissioned to produce the film and therefore has a sale or distribution agreement in place. This sort of arrangement reduces the risk largely due to production failure.</P>
    <P>An article in today's edition of <i>The Examiner</i> carries a heading &ldquo;Investors act to cut tax burden and films benefit&rdquo;. The article states:</P>
    <P>The film industry is in line for an unexpected £50 million windfall, thanks to the April 5 tax <Col N="112" /> deadline and an ever-increasing number of investors looking to reduce their tax bill.</P>
    <P>With the traditional options for those looking to shelter income greatly reduced, the option of investing in film production, which offers attractive rates of relief, is becoming a popular option.</P>
    <P>The relief has been extended for one further year and the matter will be considered further in light of the publication of the consultants' report after which I am sure we will return to this matter again. There is not another relief that gives a better return to high income taxpayers. That must be borne in mind before we make any further decisions on this matter.</P>

      <P>Section 1 is the short title and commencement, a standard provision in any intended Act. It sets out the title of the Bill as the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999 and it will come into operation on such a day or days as will be designated by the Taoiseach under the particular section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 is an interpretative section. It states that &ldquo;the Agreement&rdquo; means the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland establishing implementation bodies set in the treaty done at Dublin Castle on 8 March and that a &ldquo;Body&rdquo; means an implementation body and &ldquo;the Bodies&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
      <P>It then describes the British-Irish Agreement and its meaning, and the meaning of &ldquo;function&rdquo; and of &ldquo;implementation body&rdquo;&ndash; an implementation body established by the Agreement. It states that the &ldquo;Multi-Party Agreement&rdquo; means the Agreement signed on Good Friday, that &ldquo;the Northern Ireland Minister&rdquo; means any Minister in Northern Ireland or a department in Northern Ireland of which such a Minister is head; and that &ldquo;the North/South Ministerial Council&rdquo; means the body established by ourselves and the British.</P>
      <P>The Act will be construed accordingly and the various references are set out in subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this Bill has been prepared in a hurry and it is difficult to construct an Act which implements an agreement. However, section 2 (2) states;</P>
      <P>This Act shall be construed with due regard to the spirit and purpose of the Multi-Party agreement.</P>
      <P>I was not aware that when the legislation is implemented, and if it were to go to court for any reason, the spirit of the Agreement could be part of the interpretation of the words on the page. This is quite unusual. I have always been told that when we pass legislation, it is the terminology of the Act which is interpreted by any court of law. How does one construe the spirit of an agreement when implementing this Act? It is simply a question of clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, all the various agreements are interlinked. At our request, the draftsman included the spirit, philosophy and intention of the Multi-Party Agreement and what it stands for in this subsection. The Deputy correctly said it is an unusual insertion. However, in this context we thought it should be set out that due regard be given to the spirit, purpose, intention and philosophy of the Multi-Party <Col N="115" /> Agreement. There is nothing more sinister than that involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting there is anything sinister in it. We are passing legislation and we need to have regard to how robust it will be if it is challenged. We have no way of knowing whether it will be &ndash; one hopes it will not. Nevertheless, it may be, and given that we have seen the legislation only in the past 48 hours, I am concerned we do not pass legislation which may seem fine superficially. Many of the Government amendments are technical and deal with the absence of commas etc. which indicates the speed with which the legislation was prepared and published. There may not have been time to proof read it. I would like a clearer explanation as to why this provision is necessary.</P>
      <P>One would hope the participants, in the implementation of the Agreement, will comply with the spirit of it. We all know the current difficulties as regards the different interpretations of what precisely that spirit is and the timing of various aspects of the Agreement. I fear that inserting the well-intentioned notion that the Act should be interpreted within the spirit of the Agreement may result in a weakness in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I express a similar concern. It seems that section 2(2) asks the courts to make a political judgment. Under our Constitution there is a separation of function between the courts and the Oireachtas. To ask the courts to construe legislation in accordance with the spirit of a political agreement trenches on the separation of powers between the courts and the Oireachtas. This is a legislative innovation with which I have no sympathy.</P>
      <P>This is not a helpful subsection. It also aggravates the difficulty which will arise from the fact that there is no single appellate jurisdiction for dealing with the interpretation of the Agreement. As I said on Second Stage, the House of Lords is the Supreme Court in the UK and the Supreme Court here is the Supreme Court of this jurisdiction. They may come to different conclusions. Whatever chance there is of them coming to the same conclusion on points of law, there is certainly less likelihood that they will come to the same conclusion on matters of spirit.</P>
      <P>We are effectively asking the House of Lords, sitting in London, to construe the spirit of this Agreement in the same way as the Supreme Court of this Republic sitting in the Four Courts in Dublin. The introduction of concepts such as spirit and purpose in the legislation imports an unnecessary difficulty. I am not certain it adds anything of value. I would like to hear the Minister's explanation of why this is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily accept the thrust of Deputy Bruton's argument. I accept it is an argument which could be made but, with respect to the Deputy, the validity of it, as I <Col N="116" /> understand it, does not quite measure up. As I said to Deputy De Rossa, who quite properly raised this matter, all these agreements are interlinked and in the circumstances it would be appropriate to refer to them.</P>
      <P>Another issue raised by Deputy Bruton, which was raised by Deputy Flanagan yesterday, was dual jurisdiction, jurisdiction North and South, jurisdiction under British law and jurisdiction under Irish law. I will deal with that more specifically. However, it was dealt with by the interchange of letters between myself and the Secretary of State on Monday. She suggested that the Attorneys General in both jurisdictions should bring forward, within a given period of six months in this instance, any necessary additional refinements to the Bill, given the speed and urgency with which this Bill was introduced and the need to revise it upwards and to make it more comprehensible and comprehensive, in a minor way. However, the text is in the treaties. We felt we should refer to the Good Friday Agreement. The idea is no more or no less than underlining the purpose of this Bill, which is based on the Agreement. We want to make it clear that the Bill can be linked, by reference, to the Agreement; it is nothing more serious than that.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Agreement establishing the implementation bodies, as I said last Monday, myself and the Secretary of State &ndash; a matter which will be referred to again &ndash; exchanged letters providing for consultation between the Attorneys General to address any problems arising from divergent judicial interpretation of the legislation on the bodies in two jurisdictions, to which Deputy Bruton referred. The wording of the letters was agreed between the two Attorneys General. It was an important issue for us in the negotiations, although we are advised that the fact that the detailed arrangements are provided for in the common text of the Agreement and not separately in divergent legislation should minimise the likelihood of difference. The issue raised on Second Stage by Deputy Bruton was whether the consultation arrangements would come into effect only after the problem has emerged. While consultation is provided for in the case of such a difficulty, there is also an obligation on both Attorneys General to report within six months of the entry into force of the Agreement as to whether additional steps are required. This applies whether problems arise in that period. I realise this is an important section and that we are spending a lot of time on it. I understand I have to read out a Schedule at this point.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to press this matter to an unreasonable degree, but I have trouble <Col N="117" /> with the introduction of the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; into legislation. My very strong view is that the law should be certain, and the one thing clear about &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is that it is not certain. It is a political, philosophical and psychological issue. When I learned law a while ago&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I was led to believe that what was said in Parliament was not relevant to the interpretation of legislation. Here we are referring not only to something that is said in Parliament but the spirit of this Agreement, which is anyone's opinion. It is a historical judgment of the state of mind of people when they signed it. All that can be drawn in and used as a basis for judicial determination in what will obviously be a contested case where money is at stake and jurisdiction is being challenged. Would the drafting not be better if the Bill stated simply &ldquo;this Act shall be construed with due regard to the multi-party Agreement&rdquo; and if the references to spirit and purpose were left out?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the wording of this section for Report Stage? I know we are to deal with Report and Final Stages of the Bill tonight, but perhaps he will consult the Attorney General in relation to alternative wording. I have difficulty with this as the spirit and purpose of agreements are fine when one signs off on an agreement, and marathon negotiations were undertaken to reach this Agreement. However, interpretation of the Agreement may change slightly but significantly as politics evolves in Northern Ireland. The spirit of the Agreement may evolve, and it would seem far better if the section simply referred to the fact that the legislation should have regard to those Agreements rather than the spirit and purpose of the multi-party Agreement.</P>
      <P>To give perhaps a simplistic example, if one asked a Unionist politician what the purpose of the Agreement was, he would say it is to maintain the Union. If one asked a Republican politician for its purpose, he would say it is to establish a united Ireland. There is a problem here.</P>

      <P>It is a very serious point, and it has been well made by Deputies Bruton and De Rossa. It is interesting that when we discussed this with my estimable advisers, the legal advice was to leave it in or leave it out in the sense that we discussed it and felt we owed a debt to the multi-party Agreement for those of us, like Deputy Bruton, who were deeply involved in it. We felt in the circumstances that it would bring out the spirit and purpose of the Agreement and <Col N="118" /> that in those circumstances it should be inserted. However, I would be pleased to look at this on Report Stage and if it is feasible, taking account of the legal advice I receive, I would be glad to drop &ldquo;to the spirit and purpose&rdquo;, if that would meet Deputy Bruton's objections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the participation of the Taoiseach, Ministers or Ministers of State in meetings of the Council. It gives legislative effect of paragraph 2 of strand two of the Good Friday Agreement. Although strand two only refers to Ministers, we and the British Government have interpreted this as including Ministers of State. I understand there is a similar provision in the British Northern Ireland Act, 1998. The Council does not require fuller treatment in this Bill because it is not formally established by legislation but by a supplementary agreement signed last Monday. No additional domestic powers are needed to give effect to the relevant parts of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>A number of questions were raised on Second Stage with regard to detailed procedural arrangements. A paper is being worked on by officials, and it is intended that this would be agreed upon at the Council's first plenary meeting. It is envisaged that the secretariat would have joint heads, one from the North and one from the South. There is a general political understanding that the location will, as I stated, be in Armagh, but this has yet to be finally confirmed. The Council will meet in various formats; the plenary meetings will be twice a year, with sectoral meetings occurring regularly and frequently, as per the wording in the Good Friday Agreement, if my memory serves me. We have suggested that this should mean once per quarter in each case.</P>
      <P>In addition to overseeing the work of the consultation bodies, the council will take co-operation forward in aspects of six other areas agreed in December: agriculture, education, environment, transport, energy and tourism. However, it will also be able to consider all matters of mutual interest. We aim, if and when given the opportunity, to work this matter very vigorously and, as Deputy De Rossa implied in relation to section 2, robustly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This important section allows for the setting up of the Council. It seems that the operation of the Council will be rather like that of the Council of Ministers in the European Union. However, unlike the situation in Brussels, there will be no provision for the attendance of anyone but Ministers and Ministers of State. A strict <Col N="119" /> reading of section 3 shows there is a duty imposed on Ministers to attend rather than substitutes or representatives attending in an official capacity instead of a Minister or Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the provision of section 3 under strand two is somewhat smaller than what was envisaged or proposed in the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. I mentioned this on Second Stage to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, whose reply did not appear to accept that there was a difficulty. There may not be a difficulty, but I would have thought this section would have made some reference to an interparliamentary tier, and that the North-South Council would engage a trigger mechanism for some type of parliamentary tier. Although the Minister envisages the headquarters being in Armagh, I take it that there will be provision for some type of rotation of plenary sessions, or is it envisaged that all plenary sessions will be held at the headquarters? I assume section 3 permits the setting up of subcommittees which will meet in Northern Ireland and in the Republic from time to time.</P>

      <P>The matter of a parliamentary tier is particularly close to my heart and is one I have raised on a number of occasions with the draftsman and the Attorney General. The response I have received was that while we strongly support the formation of a new North-South and East-West interparliamentary tier, including building on the work done by the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, this is a matter for Deputies and Senators to consider with their counterparts in the other legislatures. It is something I would like to see happen. I would like to see the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, subject to the will of the Houses of the Oireachtas, establish links with the assemblies in Scotland and Wales, when set up after the summer, and the North, and build on the link with Westminster as well as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of attendance, I confirm that only the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State will be involved in an executive capacity in the councils.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue will be addressed. In the meantime the position is that only the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State will be involved in an executive capacity in the Council. The transference of the responsibilities of politicians to officials is a matter for the judgment of politicians in agreement between themselves. At Council of Ministers meetings in the European Union a diplomat can sit in in the absence of a Minister. This works extremely well. Those diplomats are of the highest calibre and integrity and have a wide knowledge of the subject with which they are concerned. This matter will have to be examined in due course. In the meantime the section as set out stands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request and one that will be examined. Dundalk and other towns on both sides of the Border have suffered as a direct result of the troubles.

However, I do not deny the Deputies the right to make their claim given that both towns have suffered grievously as a result of the violence and the attitude of both Governments, North and South, since the foundation of the State to partition and the interaction of communities on both sides of the Border. Section 3 refers to a North-South Ministerial Council. I take it from the Minister's reply that a Minister may designate an official in his or her Department to attend a ministerial council meeting. I can understand how the pressures of work, time, etc., could lead a Minister to do that. If that is going to be the practice, it should be included in the legislation and we should insist that a senior official only, such as the Secretary General or Assistant Secretary General, represent the Minister. I know the Minister said he does not like the practice, but given the range of responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, in particular, in Ireland, Europe and elsewhere, they will clearly be under severe pressure of time. We need some guarantee that if officials are to represent the State on these Councils, they should be the most senior in the Department.</P>

      <P>I understand the plea of Deputy McGahon and Deputy Crawford for Dundalk and Monaghan, respectively, and I appreciate what Deputy McGahon said about the people of Dundalk. They are a decent people and the majority, if not the entire town, are law abiding honourable good people with very few disreputable and dishonourable exceptions. For my part, I would like to think Monaghan and Dundalk will be considered in the context and manner in which the Deputies raise the issue. I would be glad to consider both these towns &ndash; Dundalk for the reasons set out by Deputy McGahon and Monaghan for those set out by Deputy Crawford &ndash; in the sense of the work that has been already done there in relation to the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, which is deeply appreciated and certainly not taken for granted. They are certainly two towns which will be near to my heart in the context of implementation bodies and offices thereat and thereunder.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> On the query again raised by Deputy De Rossa, I confirm that only the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State will be involved in an executive capacity on the councils. I genuinely do not believe it is necessary in this particular instance to set out in legislation the suggestions made by the Deputy because where would one end? The Deputy suggested that two titles, the Secretary General and the Assistant Secretaries General of Departments, should be given some form of executive role on the councils. I do not agree with that and my advice is that it is not necessary to include that in the legislation. If it comes to pass that executive power is transferred to an official, I presume it can be done<i> viva voce</i> from the Minister in his executive capacity.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, providing for the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State to attend meetings of the British-Irish Council, parallels that in relation to the North-South Ministerial Council. Similar provision is made in the British Northern Ireland Act, 1998. The council does not require fuller treatment in this Bill because it is formally established, not by legislation, but by the supplementary agreement I signed on Monday. No additional domestic powers are needed to give effect to the relevant parts of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy Flanagan referred to paragraph 10 of Strand Three yesterday. This allows for two or more of the British-Irish Council members to develop separate co-operative arrangements. It recognises that given the diversity of the members, there will be issues which are not of concern to all of them. It attempts, therefore, to balance flexibility with the maintenance of the British-Irish Council's corporate identity. I would like to think that if two or more British-Irish Council members meet to develop separate co-operative arrangements, they would let the others know. That would be a matter of courtesy; in other words, that the British-Irish Council in its totality would know what other members are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the timescale of the debate, I do not intend to revert to the point I raised yesterday to which the Minister just referred, but it is of great importance in the context of matters of devolution in the United Kingdom which will have wide-ranging consequences for the future shape of the British-Irish Council. Section 4 deals specifically with the arrangements under Strand Three. Obviously, Strand Three, paragraph 1, is particularly wide-ranging in terms of effect and accepting that, there needs to be a very clearly defined role and <Col N="123" /> function for the British-Irish Council. Obviously, it will be separate from the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the Joint Ministerial Committee on Devolution in the UK.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about duplication of fora. For example, there will be matters on the agenda for the British-Irish Council which will be under discussion at the North-South Ministerial Council and the Joint Ministerial Council on Devolution in the UK. I wonder about the question of priority. Will the British-Irish Council be squeezed out against the background of the other bodies? There needs to be a clearly defined role and function for this body at the outset so it will not become engaged in a form of duplication of issues. Again, it needs a strong interparliamentary focus which would be attended by Government representatives who would not only listen to the debates but subject themselves to answering questions from time to time on Government policy. As I said yesterday, I would look towards a beefed up British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the secretariat? Will there be an independent secretariat to the Council which will not be supplied in an unbalanced way by either the UK or ourselves? Will the budget be excessively dependent on the United Kingdom? What type of budgetary arrangements will we have? On the question of members, do we accept that this body will be evolutionary? At the outset, how many members will there be? Will there be eight or 15 and who will be involved at the initial stages? Presumably, those mentioned in the Agreement, Britain, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, will have representatives, as will the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. I wonder about the workings of a body which has a mix of sovereign states along with Crown dependencies, which are obviously of a different legal framework than others. I am wondering also about Tyneside, Merseyside, Cornwall and other areas that ultimately may seek some form of devolutionary powers within England. The English regions will lose out to the Northern Irish, the Scots, the Irish and the Welsh because they will still have their respective Secretaries of State. The overall composition strikes me as one that can very easily become unbalanced. Perhaps it is too early to address these matters, but I wonder what the thinking within our Government is on a potentially lopsided body that will just be part and parcel of what could well be a labyrinthine structure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Flanagan have made important points. If <Col N="124" /> I may take Deputy De Rossa's point first, it may not be that they are strictly necessary but we felt it desirable to include some provision in view of the importance of these institutions and the fact that there is equivalent provision in the British Northern Ireland Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan has made an important point &ndash; it is one that will have to be watched &ndash; concerning the question of overlap and whether the British-Irish Council will become a talking shop? These matters will have to be considered and worked out. We will be careful to avoid overlap and agree that the body should not be a talking shop but should have real projects.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's point on the parliamentary tier. I attach fundamental importance to that and always have. I will continue to stress that a parliamentary tier should be up and running when all the other bodies develop to that point and where there is agreement in the various parliamentary assemblies.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned figures in his speech yesterday on what the intended budgets may be. I have a note, which I can let the Deputies have, on the reference to the budget in Appendix II of the North-South bodies on the one hand and in relation to other matters related thereto. Issues such as budgets remain to be worked out. Other areas can be considered by the body in due course but it is too early. It is a matter for the bodies themselves, and the British-Irish Council in this particular instance, to consider and examine.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a regulation to remove difficulties. Section 5 is a provision of a type usually included in Bills which have the object of establishing new bodies or putting new administrative procedures in place, particularly where formulation of the relevant legislation has been done, in this instance at speed and with some urgency. It is not always possible in such circumstances to envisage at the time of drafting, all the minor practical policy and legal difficulties which may arise. This provision is designed to provide an opportunity to remedy these after the Bill has been passed.</P>
      <P>While section 5 may appear widely drafted, it must be interpreted in a constitutional manner. This means that nothing which can be done under this section may go beyond the principles and policy enshrined in the Bill. Section 5 clearly sets out the parameters and circumstances under which this power may be exercised. Any regulations made thereunder must not stray beyond these parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 5 is to give effect to the Bill. Section 5 is also, of course, subject to <Col N="125" /> a temporal limitation of three years. This is to emphasise that it is intended to operate only for a transitional or teething trouble period.</P>
    <P>Finally, regulations under section 5 are subject to Dáil scrutiny under the following section. This must be laid before the Dáil which may pass a resolution within 21 days to annul the regulations in question. This provides a further constitutional safeguard.</P>
    <P>I wondered myself if it was necessary to include this section in the Bill. My legal advice is that it is, for the reasons set out. There are precedents, including the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Waste Management Act, 1996. This section would not have been used to legislate for any substantial amendment of the treaty. That would have to be done between both Governments.</P>

      <P>This matter was referred to by the Leader of the Labour Party yesterday. When I received the Bill yesterday and read it, I found it was extraordinary in terms of its width. It was described to me as being novel, and indeed it is. Because of the time frame for the debate, perhaps the Minister can give us an example of the type of situation envisaged by the Taoiseach in which he would need to exercise this incredible power in so far as he can regulate on any difficulty under the agreement&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is not present. Despite the reassurances of the Minister, it reads as an extraordinarily broad power for the Taoiseach of the day to modify legislation. I may be wrong and I am not a lawyer. There are lawyers in the House who may be able to correct me on this but I understood it was not possible for this State to implement European Union directives by way of <Col N="126" /> secondary legislation or regulation. I understood it was necessary to bring in primary legislation which would have the effect of amending pre-existing Irish legislation. This section appears to give power to the Taoiseach to bring forward a regulation which would modify legislation. It may be that the point the Minister made concerning significant amendment is not involved, but who makes that judgment? </P>
      <P>That brings me to the second point I want to make in relation to section 6 which is connected. The regulation the Taoiseach may bring in is covered under section 6 which provides for what is known as a negative form of regulation. The Taoiseach will make a regulation and unless a motion is brought forward negativing that, it will become law within 21 days. The practice is that a negative motion of that kind can only be brought forward in Private Members' time. I am not aware of an example of a negative regulation being brought forward, certainly since 1982, when I entered the House. I have had serious reservations about regulations made in this way, but it had not been possible to bring forward a negative resolution or even to have had the regulations debated. When regulations of this kind are put forward in the House they are not debated unless a motion to negative them is tabled.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will have these broad powers for three years under section 6 and the regulation he or she will make will not be debated in the House unless the Opposition of the day can bring forward within 21 days a resolution objecting to it in Private Members' time. I am not sure of the legality of such a motion because I have been repeatedly told that motions carried in Private Members' time have no effect. We need to ask serious questions about the nature of what is proposed in this section. I am not suggesting a Taoiseach would bring forward frivolous proposals or seek to change the legislation in a serious way for party political reasons, but the House is entitled to have an opportunity of examining the regulations that are being brought forward. I suggest that section 6 should be altered at a minimum so that the Taoiseach is obliged to have the regulation debated and voted upon in Government time.</P>

      <P>What strikes me is the proverbial kitchen sink nature of section 5. Whatever about a provision that says, If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act &ndash; which is an Act of our Parliament and we stand alone to bring these bodies into legislative force &ndash; or the Agreement and so on. Picture a situation where a Taoiseach decides there is difficulty in bringing into operation, or in relation to the operation of any such provision, and he or she decides unilaterally to bring forward a change to implement some element of the Agreement, for example the very thorny question of decommissioning. Does this section allow the Taoiseach &ndash; either him or her &ndash; and I am glad to see a <Col N="127" /> reference to her, anticipating what I hope will happen before too long&mdash;</P>

      <P>One never knows. Where stands this section in relation to the part of the Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiation under the paragraph, Validation, Implementation and Review, pages 31 and 32 of that document, in which it gives an indication of how institutions can be reviewed if they are not working properly? Paragraph 7, page 32, states that if difficulties arise which require remedial action across the range of institutions, or otherwise require amendment of the British-Irish Agreement or relevant legislation, the process of review will fall to the two Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly. I cannot find a reference to consultation with the parties in the Assembly in section 5. It does not mention the Assembly. It strikes me that the person who framed this regulation to remove difficulties &ndash; as it is quaintly called &ndash; has not cross-referenced the section to the relevant paragraph in the Agreement. Will the Minister tell us how the section we are discussing and the Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations marry together and how it does not completely fly in the face of the consensus approach which gave rise to the Agreement and the way in which the two parties are marrying their legislation together?.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had continued to read the rest of the paragraphs that fall under validation, implementation and review, her questions would have been answered in part. I do not disagree with the views expressed by the Deputies on this section. On the contrary, the Deputies have serious points to make and have made them. This section was not included gratuitously to cause angst to the legislative process. It will apply only to minor technical issues that might have been overlooked in speedy drafting, as I have already indicated in my opening remarks. I cannot think of a problem that might arise except where a section has been misnumbered. It is a very technical section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, but there is a precedent and I have already indicated where the precedent arises. I have alluded to numerous precedents, including the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 and Waste Management Act, 1996. If Deputies refer to those Acts they will find a similar provision. There is nothing sinister about it. I have dealt with section 6 in my reply to section 5 in stating that it is a standard negative resolution section which is common practice. It is an unusual but common practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right. It is <Col N="128" /> a common practice and virtually every regulation that is made by a Minister is made by way of a negative motion. My point is that because section 5 is giving such wide discretionary powers to the Taoiseach of the day for a three year period, at a minimum in return for that support section 6 should make provision for a positive motion. When the Taoiseach of the day wants to amend how a particular section operates, he or she should come before the House, explain the situation and give the Dáil an opportunity to debate it and, if necessary, vote on it. The purpose of a Committee Stage is to enable everybody apply his experience to the issue. In the vast majority of cases the wisdom of the Taoiseach of the day, or the Minister and his or her officials, may prevail but there are other experiences in the House. This is a fairly new and wide power and it should be recognised that it should be done by way of a positive motion.</P>
      <P>I have a further question. The Minister says that this should deal with minor technical issues. We have that as the Minister's interpretation of the wording. I do not think the wording of the section confines it to minor technical issues as the words minor or technical are not used. The section states: If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act or the Agreement into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Taoiseach may by regulations..&rdquo; Who is to know whether the necessary amendment is not a major one? It may be found that a section of the Bill is totally unworkable for some unforeseen reason &ndash; that is not beyond the bounds of possibility but one would hope it does not arise. Nothing in the section confines this power to minor technical issues, although one hopes that is all which would emerge. I do not wish to delay the debate because the legislation is important but, for that reason also, section 6 should be amended to provide that the Taoiseach of the day should put before the House a motion on any amendment he may wish to make to this legislation.</P>

      <P>My difficulty is not so much with the legislation. The precedent quoted by the Minister was the Waste Management Act but that was different because it did not bring into effect an international treaty or agreement of the importance of the Good Friday Agreement. We were told this legislation mirrors that which was passed by the House of Commons earlier this week but I did not see in that Bill a power being reserved to the British Prime Minister similar to <Col N="129" /> that which the Taoiseach is given under this legislation. It is a sweeping power &ndash; if there is a difficulty and the Taoiseach considers it expedient to resolve it by changing the legislation, he can do so by regulation, and we parliamentarians will know nothing about it until it is placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cited the Waste Management Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act but we are masters of our own destiny as far as they are concerned. They refer to the 26 Counties and it is all right if someone wants to change them. This section would allow amendments not just to this legislation but to the Agreement. Should the Taoiseach be given this power? Deputy Flanagan asked whether the British Parliament gave its Prime Minister similar power to amend the Agreement. The section states that if any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of the Agreement into operation, the Taoiseach can make an amendment without telling the Oireachtas, and if we do not notice it in the Library it will become law within 21 days.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach of the day decided to change particular aspects of this legislation it could have significant implications for the working of the institutions which the Bill brings into being. For example, there might be a row over food safety or, in the event of a BSE outbreak the Taoiseach could decide to stop cattle from the North entering the South to mix with our cattle. The Minister said the provision is merely to allow for minor changes in case a dot or comma is left out or &ldquo;section 5&rdquo; should read &ldquo;section 6&rdquo;, but the provision does not state that. As Deputy De Rossa said, we must at least have greater certainty about what the section will do. We are not masters of our own destiny in the legislation or the Agreement, we are implementing an international accord between two sovereign countries.</P>

There is no intention to be unfair to this House. Having been here a long time I have always been conscious and strongly supportive of the rights, entitlements, responsibilities, and duties of Dáil Deputies of all parties.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with Deputy De Rossa, the point is well and strongly made and, taking account of that, I would be glad to give a positive rather than a negative tone to the section, as he suggests. Between now and Report Stage I will introduce an amendment to take account of the views expressed by him, Deputy Owen and Deputy Flanagan. I do so not from a sense of appreciation of the manner in which they have dealt with the Bill &ndash; although I am appreciative of it &ndash; but because they have made a valid point. It is important to remember that their point relates not to the present Taoiseach but the Taoiseach of the day.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the necessity, under section 6, of the Dáil having an opportunity to address any amendment which the Taoiseach of the day may bring forward under section 5. I welcome his agreement to approach such regulations by way of positive rather than negative motion. That is an important reform of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of believing the Taoiseach of the day, whoever he or she may be or from any party, would bring forward frivolous or unnecessary amendments, but mistakes have been made in this House by rushing through legislation. It happens not through deliberate intent on the part of Ministers and we are fortunate that, historically speaking, Governments have always acted responsibly in bringing forward legislation. We may not always agree with them but such measures are brought forward in the belief that they are necessary. Under the Minister's intended amendment to section 6 the House will have an opportunity to debate any amendment a Taoiseach will bring forward, and that allays my fears to some extent. Nonetheless, the power given to the Taoiseach in this section is extraordinary. If all that is intended is to address minor technical issues, it would have been possible to incorporate that in section 5 rather than providing for a broad, sweeping power in this section.</P>

Any change to that Agreement requires agreement with the British Government, in consultation with the North-South Ministerial Council. On the basis of my undertaking, I do not believe I can add much more except to suggest that there is a point to be made that any change, whether it is technical, minor or major, to any regulation or legislation should automatically come before the House. However, I take the Deputy's points and I am prepared to meet them.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has assumed responsibility for the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990. However, section 8 refers to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that matter arises. As the Deputy knows, the first item of business will be what will happen in respect of the Shannon navigation. We want to transfer the statutory powers and functions relating to the inland waterways to the new body. That transfer will take place in two phases, the first of which, as stated on Second Stage, will see the body assume responsibility for the Shannon-Erne waterway. Phase two, which will bring us up to 1 April 2000, will see the Erne system, the Shannon navigation, the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and Barrow navigation transferred to the new body. These come under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which is why <Col N="132" /> specific reference is made to the Act of 1990 in Part ll of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raised this matter is because the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has assumed responsibility for the safety of people on the Shannon under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990. This explanation was recently given to the public. People who live on the banks of Lough Derg on the Shannon are of the understanding that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources will be responsible for providing rescue services on the Shannon. Is the Minister stating that it is she who holds that responsibility?</P>

      <P>There is a distinction here. The question of safety is, as the Deputy pointed out, the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.

      <P>In view of the Deputy Carey's point, in respect of which the Minister has not provided an answer &ndash; I am surprised by the slightly truculent approach she adopted initially &ndash; would it not be wise to consider including the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in the definitions as a person to whom section 8 might refer?</P>

      <P>I reiterate that this matter involves the definition of &ldquo;safety&rdquo; and that of &ldquo;navigation&rdquo;. The question of safety comes under the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and, therefore, it is the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources while that of navigation comes under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which makes it my specific responsibility. Hence the need to allude to it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case. The man who introduced the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, Deputy Daly, is standing in the lobby and, as far as I am concerned, responsibility for safety on Lough Derg rests with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister is not concerned about people's safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must repeat that, whatever Deputy Carey might believe, the position in respect of safety is clear. Just as safety at sea is the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, safety on our inland waterways is also his responsibility. However, internal navigation is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Whether the Deputy or other Members of the Opposition want to accept that is another matter, but that is how things stand at present. That is why particular reference is made to the Act of 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that navigation will become the responsibility of an all-Ireland body while it appears that the safety of such navigation will not be the responsibility of that body? If, as is acknowledged on both sides of the House, safety is now a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and that Minister is not mentioned in the legislation, presumably the safety considerations do not come within the remit of the council or the all-Ireland body. That being so, there will be a dysfunction in the sense that navigation will be dealt with on a 32 county basis while safety will be dealt with on a 26 and six county basis. That does not make much sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is aware that, in terms of the legislation, we are only discussing six all-Ireland bodies which will have specific functions. The legislation does not deal with every area of <Col N="134" /> Government. This section deals specifically with waterways and that is what was agreed by the two Governments.</P>
      <P>This is the outcome of the negotiations between the Governments on the treaty. The responsibilities relating to inland waterways provided for in our legislation are being transferred on a phased basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is accountable to the House for the result of the negotiations. It is for her to justify why she and her colleagues agreed to a separation of safety and navigation. Navigation will be the responsibility of a 32 county body. The Minister has a responsibility to explain why she failed to ensure safety would be dealt with on the same basis. It is not a coherent arrangement.</P>

      <P>The Shannon Navigation Acts date from the last century. The Bill, which refers to six specific bodies, contains nothing new. It reflects the current position in terms of the distinct powers and functions of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands relating to safety and navigation. If that is unacceptable, there will be other opportunities to refer to the issue.</P>

      <P>Section 8 contains the definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;. Section 9 outlines the functions of Waterways Ireland, one of which will be the management, maintenance and development of inland waterways, principally for recreational purposes. The definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; should include the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources so that those who use inland waterways for recreational purposes feel protected. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is responsible for navigation only. She is not responsible for the provision of lifebuoys or other safety features. How can safety and navigation be separated? </P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of knowledge of members of the Opposition of the current position on our inland waterways is amazing. Deputy Owen is correct, the legislation deals with the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system on the island. It mirrors current provisions. If the concern is genuine, why was the matter not raised when I piloted the relevant legislation dealing with my powers and functions through the House some months ago? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister piloted the legislation through the House she was aware that the current safety regime on Lough Derg, County Clare, is managed locally on a voluntary basis. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources does not perform this function. The Minister will be aware, having attended meetings in Scariff, Mountshannon and Whitegate, that <Col N="135" /> there is a need for statutory recognition. I was glad to hear the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources would assume responsibility for safety on Lough Derg. This was announced bravely the other day as more good news from the Government by some of the Minister's colleagues. Now she is washing her hands of the matter. The section states that &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. There is no reference to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>The House expects all the inland waterways on the island to be connected. One should be able to travel from the Lagan in Northern Ireland to Kerry through the Shannon. To ensure the safety of users there is a need to include a reference to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

That brought major benefits to the six counties in the North and to the six Border counties.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome this section because of its reference to the Shannon-Erne Waterway and the Erne-Cavan-Fermanagh linkage, which is a cross Border venture that has great development potential but has been dormant for the past 30 to 40 years because of the troubles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the body in principle. It has been suggested that offices and sub-offices should be established in the Border region. County Cavan should be considered as a location for some of these because of the Erne-Shannon linkage. I also support the case made by Deputy McGahon, and by Deputy Crawford with regard to County Monaghan. I am aware we all cannot be facilitated. Nevertheless, I make a strong case for my county because the major roadway to County Fermanagh, the N3, which runs along the River Erne was closed 26 years ago and our natural hinterland with County Fermanagh was cut off, with serious consequences. Similarly the waterways were not developed.</P>
      <P>Our claim can also be justified on the strength of our achievements with regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the International Fund for Ireland. Eamonn Dunlon and Associates has cited our county as having given best value for money of the 12 counties involved in the fund.</P>

      <P>I understand that neither the Freedom of Information Act nor the Ethics in Public Office Act will apply to these bodies primarily because similar legislation does not apply in the UK. Given this, there is a need for some provision in the legislation for these bodies to be accountable and transparent to the citizen. If a person cannot access files or information under the Freedom of Information Act, how may a citizen who feels aggrieved by the actions of a body access such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Agreement provides for codes of conduct, but these are not referred to in the Bill. If they are to be bound by some forms of conduct, in what way will they be enforceable? Will they be voluntary codes? Does the Minister <Col N="137" /> not consider it would be better to include a provision to ensure, where codes of conduct are developed and agreed by the bodies and the council, they will be implemented? It appears we are creating a situation whereby the same kind of accountability that applies to local authorities, health boards and so on will not be available to the citizen with regard to these boards.

      <P>It was originally assumed there would be a body covering all Ireland tourism. That may develop from references to tourism in the Agreement. Paragraph 1.6 of Part I of Annex 2 to the Schedule states:</P>
      <P>.the Body will engage in promotion, including marketing and development of the tourism and commercial potential of the inland waterways for which it has responsibility.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte spends a significant amount of money on an annual basis marketing the tourism potential of the inland waterways. Is that function to be transferred to this board or is there likely to be parallel marketing by the board, by Bord Fáilte internationally and by the regional tourism boards on a national basis? If the board has the authority to engage in marketing the tourism potential of the inland waterways, what relationship will there be with the current system of marketing that potential, which is undertaken by Bord Fáilte? Will there be parallel marketing and, if so, what is the remit and current status of the regional tourism boards in this regard?</P>

      <P>With regard to the use of the word &ldquo;perpetual&rdquo;, this is a standard provision to ensure continuity in law. I was present with the Minister for Foreign Affairs when the question regarding headquarters was raised. No decision has been made on a location, but I will take on board the points, many of which I share. There will be an opportunity to correlate further information on that at a later date and before a decision is made. I am aware of the Deputy's concerns, which arise not only because a location in the vicinity of his constituency could be agreed but also because of a recognition of the difficulties that have arisen there in the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the question of transparency and the application of the Freedom of Information Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act. I concur with his view in that we want the greatest amount of transparency possible. The Freedom of Information Act will not apply. However, special arrangements will be made at a later date to draw up a body with its own code of conduct. I hope the issue of transparency will be covered in future discussions and that such a code will be drawn up specifically for this purpose so that everything is as open as possible. That is how I hope to proceed.</P>

I am sure the Minister knows of other such bodies which have been established where people have acquired the right of perpetual succession.

      <P>As regards the number of people on the board and how it will be constituted, at the top of the hierarchy will be the North-South Ministerial Council followed by a chief executive.

      <P>I asked a question about freedom of information and ethics. As things stand, the Irish Freedom of Information Act will not apply to this or any of the bodies. I understand there is no similar legislation in the UK and that this is part of the reason the Freedom of Information Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act is not being applied to these bodies. These bodies will be quasi-political, they will be engaged in serious decision-making and the implementation of those decisions which will have an impact on the citizens in the areas in which they operate. Citizens, therefore, should have access to documentation if they are not satisfied with the way these bodies operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I accept the Minister is sincere when she says she wants codes of practice to be in place and to operate, but there is no obligation on a board or body to comply with a code of practice. If, for some reason, it does not suit a board to lay a document before the media or an interested citizen, it can refuse even if it is in breach of a code of practice.</P>
    <P>My own experience of local authorities and health boards is that they are helpful but if they want to protect their own self-interest or the rationale for decisions made, particularly if they feel there may be a legal contest over such decisions, they will keep that information to themselves. I will not bore the Minister with the details of a recent case where information about a decision made by a local authority was refused. When I sought the information under the Freedom of Information Act, I discovered that the basis on which the decision was made was scanty and that little documentary back up was available.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider introducing an amendment to this Bill which would provide that where codes of practice are adopted by the bodies, they will be implemented by regulation before this House and have legal effect. Otherwise, we are only living in hope that if codes of practice emerge, bodies will voluntarily comply with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the sentiments underlying the Deputy's questions. It would be easier if there were two comparable approaches in both jurisdictions to freedom of information. It is the Government's wish that the bodies are fully accountable and amenable to the freedom of information and ethics regimes. However, that is not possible because the situation in the North is different from our legislation on freedom of information. I assure the Deputy it is the Government's wish that an ethics code of practice will be drawn up in conjunction with those pertaining to this agreement. It would be easier if we did not have two systems and different approaches but, unfortunately, we have. The best way is to agree to draw up a stringent code of practice, which will be done.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Deputy for not referring to his question. The legislation on inland waterways does not change the position of the regional tourism boards. Full co-operation in promoting the tourism potential of waterways with the tourism board will continue. I accept what the Deputy said that the inland waterways have tremendous potential, particularly for our <Col N="140" /> cultural tourism. I, like him, would wish not only to see this continue but to be improved. It is important to take every opportunity to market that potential.</P>

In terms of Bord Fáilte's impact on the international marketing of this tourism potential, its rights, assets and liabilities in respect of Shannon-Erne Waterway Promotions Limited are being transferred to the <Col N="142" /> body. How does that fit in with the Minister's statement that there would be co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the new body in the marketing of the tourism potential if the assets, rights and liabilities are being taken from Bord Fáilte and given to the new body?</P>

      <P>The Minister said there will be co-operation but the body is entitled to involve itself in the promotion of the tourism potential of the inland waterways; that is what the body is now entitled to do. It can engage in the promotion of the tourism potential of the inland waterways at international tourism shows and fairs. That is partly the remit of Bord Fáilte. In respect of Shannon-Erne Waterway Promotions Limited, the functions, assets, rights and liabilities of Bord Fáilte are being transferred to the body. One of the functions of Bord Fáilte is to promote the tourism potential of Shannon-Erne. That is now being taken away from Bord Fáilte and given to the body.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>The Deputy is correct in outlining the role of Bord Fáilte. With regard to Shannon-Erne Waterway Promotions Limited, this body was established specifically to promote the Shannon-Erne waterway on a North-South basis. The nature of the body and its promotional functions relate to tourism potential generally, and the functions of the Shannon-Erne Waterway Promotions Limited are now being transferred to this new body. The body that will be set up under the North-South Ministerial Council will work in conjunction with the bodies that already market the island.</P>

      <P>It is important to clarify some points. Where will the headquarters of this board be located? Will it be in the Cavan-Monaghan region? I do not want to get into trouble with my <Col N="143" /> colleague behind me from Cavan but one proposal that has come forward is the extension to the Ulster Canal which goes from the Erne, through my county, and on to Lough Neagh. The Blackwater and the Faughan rivers cross the Border. Will it be extended to ensure the potential of those structures are taken into account? I worry when I see Deputy Kenny become excited about the Shannon. We want to see the Border area benefit from what is a cross-Border structure. We need to be clear about the location of the headquarters because we heard earlier that one headquarters will be located in Armagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support my constituency colleague and advise him that I have already laid claim to the town of Cavan for one of these headquarters and I believe I have the Minister's goodwill and I hope to retain it. I hope we will not fall between two stools with regard to the promotion of this region. The Erne catchment region which comprises Fermanagh and Cavan has been largely unsold. It was not a saleable product over the last decade due to the troubles. We must get the marketing right. There is tremendous potential for tourism that will benefit smallholders and alternative enterprises in tourism related projects.</P>
      <P>There are various queries about the Minister's responsibilities. We have established she is responsible for navigation. There are years of work ahead in that area because there are vast areas of mudbanks and other obstacles in the Erne catchment. I have travelled the area and did a little duck shooting there so I am aware of what is available and what must be done.</P>
      <P>Goodwill will be forthcoming. The Bill uses the word &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo; which I do not like. When acquiring rights or rights of way that have been closed for decades, it is better to approach the landowners with goodwill. Do not adopt a heavy handed approach. The people themselves wish to be involved in realising the potential of this area.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has this power I wish to draw to her attention the little piece of rock on the Erne between Belturbet and Killeshandra about which I have written to her on numerous occasions. It has not yet been removed so the Minister might take it on as her first project. If it is removed it will make the Erne navigable to the Shannon. We have one of the finest waterways in Europe and it has tremendous possibilities. I hope we get this legislation right and that we can market and organise the waterway properly so it can be made available for the many pursuits for which it is suitable &ndash; boating, fishing, swimming, canoeing&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are three references to the Ulster Canal in the Bill. It states that the Body will &ldquo;take forward appropriate studies and appraisals in relation to the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal&rdquo;. The provision continues:</P>
      <P>If, in the light of the outcome of the studies and appraisals referred to at paragraph 1.1(b), NSMC so decides, the Body will, with effect from such date as NSMC may decide, be responsible for the restoration of the Ulster Canal and, following restoration, for its management, maintenance and development principally for recreational purposes.</P>
      <P>I have long had an interest in the Ulster Canal. In a previous political existence I was involved in trying to forward the development of the canal and in studies relating to it. I retain my committed interest.</P>
      <P>It would be a considerable asset to the tourism potential of the area. There will be support for its restoration north and south of the Border. Indeed, more of the canal is located north of the Border. It runs from the Erne catchment at Belturbet into the Clogher valley, joins the River Blackwater and flows into Lough Neagh. There is considerable interest in this issue in both communities in the North.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister elaborate on how she visualises this coming about? It will not be an easy project. The Ulster Canal has been out of commission for a long time and there might be problems in relation to the owners. Some public authorities might have ownership too. I hope that problem can be solved. Does the Minister have information on the extent to which there might be problems in taking back ownership from people who have owned it for a considerable length of time?</P>
      <P>Is there a possibility of the Coalisland Canal being linked to the Ulster Canal? It could be reopened as work is advanced on the Ulster Canal. One other matter is worth mentioning. All Members seek to promote the interests of their constituencies when a decision is to be made about where a body should be located. I cannot link my present constituency with this body&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the issue of transparency and the codes of practice. I do not question the Minister's commitment to ensuring there is transparency. However, that is just a promise. There is nothing in the Bill to oblige the bodies to adopt codes of practice in relation to transparency and freedom of information.</P>
      <P>I accept it is not possible to state in this Bill that the Republic's freedom of information legislation will apply to these bodies until there is similar legislation in the UK which will also apply the same rules to the information. However, the Bill should at least include a provision whereby the codes of conduct freely adopted by the body concerned are enforceable in law and not simply at the whim of the board. The board might decide to overturn its code of conduct at some point because it might suit it. It could be a simple matter of self preservation. The Bill provides that the bodies can be sued as corporate bodies. They will, therefore, inevitably be self defensive in cases where people seek information.</P>
      <P>There is a need for an amendment to this Bill to provide for the adoption of codes of practice which would be enforceable by law. I do not have a copy of the 8 March Agreement, but it is possible that under section 10(2) and (3) the reference to codes of practice could be incorporated in a similar way to Parts I and 7 of Annex 2. That type of amendment should be introduced or the Minister should give a solemn promise that adopted codes of practice will be enforceable by law and legislation should be introduced to provide for that. While every other public institution in this State is liable to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, we are creating a precedent whereby these bodies will not be liable to them.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputies Boylan, Crawford and Currie, who spoke about his former constituency, for putting forward strong <Col N="146" /> cases for their constituencies. They proved they are good constituency representatives by doing that. Deputy Crawford was not present when Deputy Boylan raised this matter in response to which I told him a decision had not been taken on the location of the headquarters. That will be decided later. It will be a political decision made by the Ministers concerned and I understand that decision will be made in the next few weeks. I understand the difficulties facing the Border counties, particularly in trying to promote tourism, because of the sad political situation that prevailed there over the past 30 years. I understand where the Deputies are coming from and I will consider their points when final decisions are made about locations.</P>
      <P>A board in the context of the waterways is not a board in the sense of the boards of some of the other bodies referred to, particularly in regard to the Irish language. We are talking about a chief executive. His or her location has not been decided, but it will be decided in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan's point that we should approach landowners in a sensitive way. That must be done in regard to the acquisition of further lands.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Currie said about the Ulster Canal. That would be a wonderful project. I am informed it is 80 kilometers long and runs midway between the North and South. That project has tremendous potential. I am sure the Deputy is aware a feasibility study carried out on the canal has been published. References were made to the likely cost of this project, which could amount to £80 million. The canal also requires a good deal of refurbishment because it has been closed since 1930. Further detailed studies on this project will have to be carried out by the new inland waterways body, but the fact that a feasibility study has been completed will greatly help to promote this project.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the Benburb Gorge. I am informed it is a significant point in the canal. Perhaps I will have an opportunity to visit it in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the establishment of a Food Safety Promotion Board. To paraphrase what the Minister said last night, food scares have no borders and neither must food safety measures.</P>
      <P>For what functions will the Food Safety Promotion Board have responsibility? Will have it have responsibility for the promotion of food safety and research into it? The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was set up last year and presumably there is a similar structure in Northern Ireland. Over the past 12 months there was a great deal of public debate about food safety scares such as BSE. On such occasions it was apparent there were differences in emphasis, standards and testing between the various regulatory agencies. Does the Minister hope we will have a strict and similar standard through the Food Safety Promotion Board in both jurisdictions? At the time of the BSE debate there was one set of concerns in the South and a different emphasis in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Inspection and enforcement remains the same on both sides of the Border. The introduction of this body will not change that. The laws which pertain to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act remain and the enforcement and inspection requirements of the authority remain with it.</P>
      <P>This promotion board will research areas such as those the Deputy mentioned. The Food Safety Promotion Board can identify gaps in research and areas in which there is a lack of harmonisation. We may ask the Food Safety Promotion Board to conduct work in that field and report to the North-South Ministerial Council and the respective Governments could then examine means of amending their respective legislation to bring about harmonisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Food Safety Promotion Board is not to bring about harmonisation. The role of the board involves promotion, research and the communication of food alerts, something which already exists on an operational basis. The issue which will have to be teased out will be the reporting from the EU to this body. Will EU reports be issued to it through the respective sep<Col N="149" /> arate Departments or will the relationship between the EU and the implementation bodies be direct? That is yet to be worked out.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the board is not to bring about harmonisation <i>per se</i>. In the research it conducts there may be areas where there is a lack of harmonisation and it would wish for us to conform, but our agricultural interests and their agricultural interests may not directly coincide, as was the case with BSE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Harmonisation is the key in such a small island. It is often the cause of confusion that there is one set of concerns here and another in Northern Ireland. We must focus on that at an early stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of what the Deputy says. In many instances scientific fact remains the same &ndash; it is location neutral. The scientific basis for surveillance of food borne disease is established fact available in all jurisdictions. There may be areas where similar problems are not approached on a similar basis and I would like to see the Food Safety Promotions Board being a vehicle by which we could deal with those anomalies where they are a matter of historical accident and not based on independent scientific fact.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that the Food Safety Authority Act be amended. What role would the new body have in relation to genetically modified organisms or foods which may contain genetically modified ingredients? At the moment the Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility for monitoring that area and ensuring the regulations are complied with. Will this body, given that we are talking about food safety, also have a relationship with the Environmental Protection Agency? Will the Environmental Protection Agency be obliged to co-operate with it, as the Food Safety Authority will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority also has a role in the safety aspect of genetically modified foods. The EPA has a role in the growing and environmental circumstances of the propagation of genetically modified foods. There are a number of Departments which have different areas of responsibility in relation to genetically modified foods. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland will retain its role in that respect.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged the Food Safety Promotion Board will allow us to build on that level of co-operation on an all-island basis. That area may be one which the body would like to take into its competence &ndash; assessing on an all-island basis what the impact of these issues might be. It would only be in relation to the food safety aspect, however. The question of delimiting the functions of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is only in respect of the six areas outlined in the annex as set out in the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Food quality is an issue which is dealt with by the Department of Agriculture and Food.

      <P>This section has very few teeth; it seems to be an academic exercise. Paragraph 1.2 of Part 2 of Annex 2 to the Schedule states that the body will continue to be responsible for inspection and enforcement in the North and South separately. It goes on to state that existing arrangements for international negotiations, the setting of food standards and the promulgation of legislation and regulations will continue to apply. In other words, at international fora, the Northern Ireland and southern Ireland food safety authorities&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that correction, perhaps he will allow me make my point. Both authorities could be arguing for different levels of food safety for this small island. Is the Minister saying that this is as much power as can be given to this body? There is very little understanding of how airborne infection can move from one side of the Border to the other.</P>
      <P>It is very well to have academics, researchers and microbiologists sharing information, but there does not seem to be anything more coming out of this body. We could have major problems in the North and the Republic and we would not be helping each other except by sharing information about it. There are no regulations which can prevent food being sold on either side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the priority of this Government in this area has been to set up an independent, science-based authority with teeth. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and I were commended last year when we introduced that Act. It has far greater power than the one envisaged by the previous Administration, which was simply an advisory board. I am glad it is recognised that we need a food safety authority with teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The body envisaged in this legislation builds on existing levels of co-operation, North and South. The idea that this will start co-operation in these specific areas is a misnomer. There is already a great deal of operational co-operation, for <Col N="151" /> obvious reasons, between both jurisdictions. In relation to food safety promotion, when a structured food safety campaign is necessary on an all-island basis, this board will co-ordinate it. It will not be done separately by the two existing boards.</P>
    <P>As regards enforcement and inspections, obviously on an operational level it is necessary to maintain the existing structures of both jurisdictions to continue with that work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>To maintain consumer confidence and ensure people understand we have existing agencies in place. The setting up of this board is timely because the British Government is bringing forward proposals to change their food safety structures. I am glad to report to the House that the chairperson of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has informed me that at a recent European conference, the model we have adopted and enacted in the past 12 months is admired by many member states and will be imitated by them&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;a model which will be imitated by our counterparts within the European Union, this board seeks to build on existing levels of co-operation, identifying areas of research and ensuring that airborne surveillance is carried out on an all-island basis. These are all important steps forward in confirming and establishing consumer confidence on a Thirty-two County basis, which is the purpose of setting up these bodies in the first place. They will work hand in hand with existing bodies, in the same way as trade promotion and language bodies will continue to exist on both sides of the Border. These cross-Border bodies have the potential to ensure we look at the resolution of problems, identify gaps on an all-island basis and deal with them as such. That is the remit of all of these bodies and I do not accept they do not meet that.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to raise relates to how this body will operate or act on food safety issues, deriving from the relatively new issue of genetic engineering of ingredients in food. I am not one of those people who goes berserk at the thought of genetically modified ingredients. There are benefits to be gained from genetic engineering as there are disadvantages. It does not appear to be addressed in the terms of reference provided to this body in the promotion of food safety. It is important, bearing in mind the need to reassure consumers about the food they are buying, whether in Northern Ireland or the Republic, that stringent conditions are applied to how such modified ingredients are used and that they have been adequately tested.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment by the Government of a statutorily based Food Safety Authority. The Minister knows the advisory board we put in place was an interim measure and the direction in which the Government went was the direction in which we were going in any event.</P>

This will become an issue of increasing importance for consumers and we will debate it in a week or two.

If this new board feels there is a gap in the research of food constituent bodies which have responsibility for this area, it can deal with that. None of us would encourage duplication of effort. This body, once it meets, will be served by an advisory committee which will include scientific expertise, as applies to the NSAI at present. Independent verification of all these issues for the purposes of promoting consumer confidence is, of course, a primary purpose for the NSAI in this jurisdiction and is also a primary reason for bringing in this cross-Border body on food safety issues.</P>

    <P>and for each additional 1,000 hl of production after 4,000 hl, the excise rate shall increase in increments of 1% of the base rate, subject to an upper limit of 100% of the base rate.'.</P>
    <P>(2) Subject to the provisions of this chapter, a rebate of 3% of the total excise paid in respect of beer produced in a microbrewery shall be allowed subject to compliance with such conditions as the Revenue Commissioners may think fit to impose.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the excise treatment of beer brewed in microbreweries. We had a lengthy discussion of this on Committee Stage, as a result of which I formed the view that the Minister might do something about this if he was in better humour. He was in particularly poor humour on the day in question and he did nothing. I thought we would have another go at this subject. The case is a compelling one, and the cost to the Exchequer would be minimal.</P>
    <P>The argument is simple. There are relatively few of these microbreweries, which are basically pubs where beer is brewed. Only 40 or 50 people are employed in this area, but it is reasonable to say the potential for employment is considerable, and they are a great tourist attraction. We had a lengthy debate on this matter on Committee Stage which I do not wish to repeat. The Minister said he was in a stingy humour then. I hope he <Col N="155" /> has mellowed over the weekend and might be willing to be more constructive on the amendment.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage, and I support Deputy McDowell's amendment. On mature reflection, the Minister will see the merit in this amendment. It might be slightly more complicated to buy a round after a cumann meeting if he had to buy a Newbridge Black or a light brown beer from Naas, but there is no economic or fiscal reason for not doing this, and it would stimulate an interesting little industry in its infancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to introduce lower rates of excise duty on beer brewed in small scale breweries. Deputies will recall that this issue was raised in the Dáil on a number of previous occasions and that I announced in reply that I have no plans to introduce a zero, a low or a staggered system of excise duty on beer brewed in such small scale breweries.</P>
      <P>Irish excise duties do not discriminate between large and small breweries, and the tax system is not a source of competitive distortion. Excise duty from beer is an important source of revenue and amounted to £365 million in 1998. Furthermore, excise on beer was last increased in the January 1994 budget. The share of price represented by total tax, including VAT, has declined from 37.6 per cent in 1994 to 35.1 per cent in 1998. All breweries have, accordingly, been advantaged by a relative decline in the share of price attributable to tax. In addition, relatively high-priced premium craft beers bear no extra duty compared with same-strength mass produced beers. The proportion of price represented by tax is accordingly less for such premium beers.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee that any reduction in the rate of excise duty would be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to have had a very enlightened weekend. If I understand his response correctly, he is saying he does not see any difference between small scale breweries and large multinationals. There is a distinct difference between multinationals which make enormous profits and produce huge amounts of beer and these small scale indigenous industries which are an attraction to tourists and in their infancy in this country.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to tell me whether he thinks this is an industry, an activity or practice he would encourage. If so, why is he not willing to do so with the fiscal instruments available to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give Deputies the European Union background to this matter. Under Article 4.1 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC, member states may apply reduced rates of duty, which may be differentiated in accordance with the <Col N="156" /> annual production of the breweries concerned, to beer brewed by independent small breweries within the following limits: the reduced rates shall not be applied to undertakings producing more than 200,000 hectolitres of beer per year, and the reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, shall not be set at more than 50 per cent below the standard national rate of excise duty.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the reductions proposed in Deputy McDowell's amendment would not be permitted by the directive. At present, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands avail of the provisions of Article 4.1 of the directive. Any proposed low or staggered regime would also have to apply to imports of beer produced in small breweries in other member states in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.3 of the directive.</P>
      <P>The duty is a specific tax which does not increase in relation to the value of the product. A higher priced premium craft beer bears the same amount of duty as a mass produced product of the same strength and, accordingly, a lower tax share of price than that of a mass produced product. At present, there are 13 microbreweries approved by the Revenue Commissioners, and the total amount of beer brewed was 15,000 hl in 1998. The estimated cost of granting the lower excise rate based on a 0.25 per cent share of the market is £500,000 in a full year. If market share increases to 0.5 per cent, it would cost the Exchequer £1 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 67:</P>
      <P>In page 270, line 42, to delete &ldquo;1,400&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1,600&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to accommodate the 1.6 litre engine, the typical family car. The proposed increase in VRT is another attack on the rural dweller. A long discussion took place here today about rural Ireland, how it has been penalised and the number of people leaving it. This is another blow to the typical rural dweller given that the family car of most rural dwellers has the 1.6 litre engine. Many of those people travel long distances to work and need a strong car. The average horse power of cars in rural areas is 1.6 litres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment which provides for a modest increase in cubic centimetres is designed to help the family worker and the rural dweller. There is no reason the Minister should not accept it. In recent years PAYE workers have accepted minimum pay increases under the various partnership programmes with the promise of tax reductions and lower interest rates. They got the PAYE and PRSI reductions and now have lower interest rates because of forces outside our control and the fiscal policy we have pursued. Why is the Minister proposing to increase VRT, a critical tax for most PAYE workers? For those who hope to benefit from the taxation measures in the Finance <Col N="157" /> Bill, all the benefits will be diluted because of the 3.3 per cent increase in VRT. Before Christmas I went to a garage with the intention of buying a car. By the time I purchased it after Christmas it cost me £700 extra. Any benefit I got from the PAYE reductions was totally wiped out because of this increase.</P>
    <P>Commercial companies renew their fleet annually because of hard driving and wear and tear. The VRT will increase their operating costs. A phrase I heard recently was that the 1.6 litre car is the workhorse of the nation. It is the typical car of most commercial companies. That sector which is driving our economy is being penalised with this increase. Commercial travellers will have to face increases in benefit-in-kind taxes as a result of this hike.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred much to environmental tax. Deputy Noonan referred to him as an eco warrier during the debate on Committee Stage. This is not an environmental measure although the Minister is trying to sell it as such. At a time when EU policy is to encourage citizens to replace old cars with new cars and to be environmentally conscious, the Minister is moving in the opposite direction. The increase in VRT is the first step in environmental taxation. I pay tribute to the motor industry which has taken measures to reduce emissions, fuel consumption and so on by examining technology, developing better engines, fuel use and so on. It now takes 30 new cars to produce the same level of emissions as one new car five years ago. Therefore, the more new cars on the roads the better for the environment. This provision will however discourage people from buying new cars, instead they will take the imported option.</P>
    <P>The real impact of this environmental tax is that more people will buy second-hand imported cars, many of which are eco rejects from their country of origin. Ireland has now become the dustbin of Europe for second-hand cars. We import approximately 40,000 cars each year but export none. The forecourts of garages are crowded with second-hand cars that will never be moved because they are not competitive due to the VRT element. The Minister's stated policy on green taxation is a contradiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the economic benefits would be in the region of £43 million. I am not worried about those with cars over 2 litres, the Mercedes and so on. Sales in that sector which can look after itself will yield £15 million. The Minister will note from the amendment that I have reduced my demand from a 2 litre engine to a 1.6 litre engine. I estimate that sales of cars with 1.6 litre engines and 2 litre engines will yield another £15 million. Already the Minister has £30 million and has only £13 million to make up to reach his target. Given the buoyancy in the motor trade, he will achieve that target. I predict he will achieve about £60 million from this provision. By making a small concession he would satisfy the typical family motorist, those who are fed up with gridlock in the cities and bad roads in the country. This mat<Col N="158" /> ter will become a major issue just as PAYE became a major issue. Motor taxation, the level of VRT, VAT and insurance will become a big issue. The Minister would lose nothing by accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>Car sales have increased substantially as a direct result of an increase in the car ownership age group, less emigration and more people at work. As I pointed out during the debate on the Bacon report, one of the reasons for the increased house prices is the number of people in good jobs and their ability to obtain mortgages on the strength of their incomes. The same applies to the sale of cars, more people at work means more people are buying cars. New car sales are unique in that they depend on the ability to sell a trade-in which is already burdened with a high level of residual VRT. This situation has been further exacerbated due to the proposed VRT increases which make Irish used cars less competitive, relative to used imports. As used car stocks in garages build up there is cause for concern regarding the long-term problems. Where will those cars be dumped? What will happen to them? There will be a cost factor in the end.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted from several EU documents during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill, 1999, and will do so now to support my case. In the EU working document on the automotive industry published in November 1998, the EU Commission stated that the promotion of a more coherent and environmentally orientated vehicle taxation system through the establishment of an overall Community framework should be considered. Countries such as France, Germany and the UK have no additional registration tax so the Irish adjustment should be in a downwards direction. The recent VRT increases fly in the face of this policy. This document goes on to state that among the legal provisions adopted at EU level is a framework for fiscal incentives targeting the sales promotion of new clean cars respecting new European emission standards. I understand the Department of the Environment and Local Government report on sustainable development takes this point on board. The crude measure of VRT increases adopted by the Government do not do this and will, in the long run, favour the importation of older less environmentally friendly cars from abroad. That is happening. Every day one sees Japanese cars on the road.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's point on our amendment on Committee Stage about the difference between the two VRT rates of 22.5 per cent and 30 per cent being too steep. I took this point on board to try to strengthen my argument for a reduction of between 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent. That is why I modified the amendment to make it more reasonable and to give the Minister every opportunity to accept it. This cut off point of 1.6 per cent should be viewed as a more natural cut off point, as it is the cut off point for capital allowances used by the Minister. It would also allow him to retain his current three band structure for which he argued so convincingly on Com<Col N="159" /> mittee Stage. Even in a discussion afterwards he said there would be too great a leap between the bottom and top rate and that there would be no medium rate.</P>
    <P>On the environmental issue to which the Minister will refer, he might consider the approach adopted in other EU states such as the UK where consumers are encouraged to use smaller vehicles through positive incentives rather than penalties. The Minister is trying to encourage people to buy smaller cars by penalising them and by using a disincentive whereas in England people are given a positive incentive. The scrappage scheme introduced by the last Government was a far more positive environmentally friendly incentive than the measures the Minister is taking here.</P>
    <P>I look forward to his reply. This is only starting to become a major issue. He would take much of the pressure off himself &ndash; I know he does not succumb to pressure, which I recognise and appreciate &ndash; and would do himself much good if he accepted this modest proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good compromise between the amendment we tabled on Committee Stage and the Minister's attitude and it would, in effect, exempt the family car from the impositions he proposes. I spent 12 months in the 1980s traipsing across to Brussels negotiating the various national road blocks which were inhibiting the implementation of the Single Market. At the time the expectation was that when the Single Market came in all goods and services would trade freely in the euro zone.</P>
      <P>The hit to the Exchequer in applying the Single Market to the motor trade was significant and VRT was introduced, in effect, to protect the revenue. There was an expectation that it was a temporary measure &ndash; do not tell me income tax was introduced in 1890 as a temporary measure &ndash; to protect the revenue for a period. The Minister's predecessors in office recognised it as such and movement had commenced in bringing down VRT to lower rates. It takes a good deal to amaze me but I was amazed on budget day that the Minister had gone in the opposite direction. He has gone in that direction for the wrong reasons, and those which he stated are not the real reasons for the change.</P>
      <P>Transport policy is in an absolute mess and the level of taxation on motor vehicles is part of that policy. There is no way to solve the difficulties of traffic and transport by applying the stick without applying any carrot, and this is an attempt to apply the stick. As Deputy Deenihan point out, the argument that we are getting a more environmentally friendly result does not stand up, and yet that was the Minister's stated reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the real reason &ndash; VRT does not impact on the consumer price index. The Minister needed between £40 million and £50 million extra revenue but he decided not to put tax on cigarettes where it should have been put because it would have had a more significant impact on the <Col N="160" /> consumer price index. There is a difference of about 135p in the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes between the Minister's position post-budget and that in the UK post-Gordon Brown's budget yesterday.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Health somebody asked me what single thing would most benefit the health of the people. The answer is self-evident &ndash; stop smoking. If 28 per cent of the people stopped smoking, it would have a major impact on the health services. The Minister has gone against precedent by putting 5p only on the price of 20 cigarettes when he should have put at least 10p. His colleague in the United Kingdom has put 20p on the price of 20 cigarettes. To some extent, we rely on advertising, notices and health promotion programmes to stop people smoking but it is not working because the number of people smoking has gone up by 2 per cent according to the last figures I saw. The United Kingdom relies far more on excise increases on a price sensitive item to stop young people, in particular, from smoking.</P>
    <P>Young women are smoking in increasing numbers, and that may be connected to their lifestyle and their desire to be slim. Young men in secondary schools are not smoking as much probably because they are involved in team games to a greater extent than young women. It is a very serious problem in that young women in their adolescent years are becoming addicted to nicotine and the Minister is feeding them by only putting that small imposition on the price of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The price of cigarettes is relevant here because the Minister made a policy choice to slam the increase on VRT because it did not have a consumer price index effect and he would not put it on cigarettes because at the time there was a fear of inflation and it being reflected in the CPI. It is a bad decision on a multiplicity of grounds which I do not believe the Minister can justify. As Deputy Deenihan said, the Minister dressed it up and argued for it as if it was a green tax and his first movement towards environmental tax. That does not stand up to any analysis. By increasing VRT, the Minister is being very unfair to the motorist and making the most expensive car in Europe still more expensive. He is doing so at a time when the Exchequer did not really need the revenue. While none of us were looking for great leaps downward, we thought the Minister would at least take a point or a point and a half off VRT across the range of cars.</P>
    <P>If this is the first step of a new policy, what is the Minister's intention next year and the one after? Will he continue to increase VRT for the stated reasons or have we taken it to a ceiling now? Will the Minister indicate how he sees the future? Will there ever be a proper Single Market in terms of the motor industry? To make the environment even more friendly next year, will the Minister hit VRT again? The Minister has to put his cards on the table and plan forward. I am very mindful of what he said on a number of <Col N="161" /> occasions, that the Minister and the Government decide on the day. However, when dealing with an industry such as the motor industry and the pressures of a failed transport policy, the public has a right to know in which direction the Minister is leading. Will he increase the level to take it down, will he take it up further the next time or leave it where it is? The Minister would do much to assure goodwill in the House if he accepted the amendment. It is a good compromise which exempts the family car and that most used by commercial travellers. For all the reasons that Deputy Deenihan has stated, I recommend the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I remember during the debate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1998, I asked the Minister why he had reduced VRT by what was actually a very small percentage. I think it was 0.2 of 1 per cent, if my memory serves me correctly. The Minister said he felt he had to give them something and 0.2 of 1 per cent was not much anyway. Nonetheless it was an indication of his thinking. Certainly, at that stage there was no thought in his mind of raising VRT for the purposes either of&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the trade off? Still, the Minister was reducing VRT and in so far as we could glean anything in terms of Government policy from that, I assume the intention was to continue to reduce it. We have a high tax regime on cars. As Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out, it was continued during the 1980s, largely for revenue purposes to protect the Exchequer. That is no longer a sufficient reason to maintain a high tax regime on cars. With the emergence of the Single Market seven years ago, many people were disappointed that there was not an immediate benefit in terms of being able to buy cars at prices comparable to those of our European partners. Seven years later we are not only in the same position but VRT has started going up rather than down and most people will find that inexplicable. It can no longer be justified purely in terms of the needs of the Exchequer because clearly they are far less than they were only a few years ago. For all the reasons given by my Fine Gael colleagues, it cannot be justified on ecological grounds either.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to discourage the use of cars, he should be looking precisely at that &ndash; discouraging their use, not discouraging ownership. One then has to start looking at admittedly difficult political issues, such as taxation of road usage or petrol. However, taxing the ownership of cars is not the way to go about it. From an ecological point of view it does not make any sense. The two primary arguments of protecting the Exchequer and the ecological one fall away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an onus on the Minister and the Government to justify a high tax regime on cars <Col N="162" /> because there is no obvious justification for it. Given the conflicting signals of this year and last, motorists are entitled to ask for a clear policy indicator as to what the Minister's thinking is for future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a major mistake concerning the combined expenses of a home. From my experience in business, I know that the financial institutions are making money freely available to people to buy cars. They can just sign up and get a car with little or no requirement for a surety. Given heavy mortgage and car repayments, it is grossly unfair to further tax a 1.6 litre family car which is a necessity.</P>
      <P>Vehicles with 1.9 litre diesel engines are used widely in rural areas. Such strong vehicles are required for agricultural purposes, including transporting goods to marts. Householders need good cars, especially with the introduction of the roadworthiness test in the near future, and it is unfair to add £600 or £800 to motoring costs. The role of the banks must be questioned in this matter. Prior to Christmas I know of an instance where the banks said they would cushion the additional loss by getting 1998 cars registered in 1999. That certainly raises a question.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan mentioned, we have the most expensive cars in Europe. Car owners are already contributing considerably to the Exchequer and I appeal to the Minister to move the cc band cut off point from 1.4 to 1.6 litres. He should accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>If one looks at any garage forecourt, one will see that the trade in used cars must compete with cheaper imports both from Japan and the UK. The high level of VRT makes such cars uncompetitive, even though the future of the industry depends on being able to dispose of these used cars. That question may not have an immediate impact but garage owners are already having extreme difficulty in selling used cars because of competition from importers of cheaper cars from Northern Ireland, Britain and Japan. This provision is a major mistake and the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment. As I have stated previously on Committee Stage, the new three band structure for VRT was introduced both in order to raise revenue and to begin to tackle the environmental damage being caused by the motoring sector. It is designed in a way that favours the purchase of smaller-engined cars while discouraging the purchase of larger-engined vehicles. I consider that this new three band structure will be more effective in influencing the size of vehicle purchased, avoiding a harsh transition between bands and rates and allowing buyers to opt for lower-powered vehicles in a given vehicle class. The new structure can be further built on and refined in the future, if so desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These particular cc bands have been chosen because they are considered to best approximate to small, medium and large-engined cars, and also <Col N="163" /> because there appears to be a natural divide in the car market at around these cut-off points between competing marques and models. I consider that this relationship is not present in the structure proposed by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Although it is early days yet, the figures for new car registrations for January and February 1999 show that the VRT restructuring has been effective. The volume of sales has not been adversely affected, as was widely predicted by opponents of the restructuring. New car registrations to the end of February 1999 are up by almost 24 per cent on the same period last year. In addition, and as was intended by the restructuring, the introduction of the three band structure would appear to have caused a shift in the cc profile of new cars registered. New car registrations to the end of February 1999 show an increase of 7.3 per cent in the market share of cars below 1,401 cc.</P>
    <P>This matter was dealt with on Committee Stage and in various other fora. There has been intensive lobbying. I will not repeat all the arguments I made on Committee Stage and in other debates, both inside and outside the House. However, it is important to put a few facts on the record. I respect Deputy Deenihan, who has pursued this matter with great vigour since it was first announced in the budget. He is to be complimented on the research and expertise which he has brought to bear on the subject. I certainly commend his tenacity in pursuing this matter but I do not agree with his contention. During his contribution on Report Stage he referred to the fact that the family worker has been upset by all of this. It is my belief that this is nearly akin to when one hears politicians saying that the people do not want a general election. What they mean is that they, the politicians, do not want a general election.</P>
    <P>As is evidenced by the figures, car purchasers have not been too upset by this change. The reason Deputy Perry adverted to, but used for another purpose, is probably the one which has had most effect &ndash; that the cost of motor finance has fallen considerably in the recent years, and particularly in the past year. That has compensated more than adequately for the increase in the average price of a car as a result of changes I introduced in VRT. I suggest that is the reason why the average person, either in rural or urban areas, has not been too agitated by this increase.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan should really have adverted to the fact that some motor dealers have been considerably upset. They have effectively lobbied Deputies on all sides of the House, as is the motor industry's job. I have no complaint with that but they are wrong in a number of points they put forward. Doom and gloom was being predicted for the motor industry in January and February 1999, yet the figures show records being achieved on top of previous records. There are many reasons for that, including the general state of the economy, but it disproves the point that the pur<Col N="164" /> chasing public have been inconvenienced by this to any great extent. For the reasons I have just outlined, they have not.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, I have always been up front about the reasons for making the changes on this occasion. They were environmental and revenue raising. As I further pointed out on Committee Stage, when the Minister for Finance comes to decide a number of taxation issues prior to the budget, he takes into account a number of factors, for example, the effect on the consumer price index of increasing the cost of cars, petrol, beer and other indirect taxes. The Minister for Finance must make up his mind having taking account of the overall economic picture.</P>
    <P>The motor industry has done exceptionally well in recent years. New car sales were quite good in the early 1980s but in the following ten years they dropped by half. In recent years they have reached record levels and nobody in the motor industry can complain about the level of business. The scrappage scheme was a success and when I abolished it in 1998 I made an adjustment by lowering vehicle registration tax.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Deputies advocating a reduction in taxes in all areas, income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, indirect taxes and vehicle registration tax. Someone has to pay for the running of the country. The £43 million which I expect to collect in vehicle registration tax may be a relatively small amount of money in terms of the Exchequer finances but it is a fairly significant amount when viewed in the context of acceding to requests to reduce hospital waiting lists. It is not too much to ask some sectors to pay a little. When viewed against cheaper car finance, the increase in vehicle registration tax has had a minimal impact on the motor industry. People who demand increases in public expenditure for improvements in the health service, roads and education should not complain if the Minister for Finance of the day makes a small adjustment to raise a small amount of money from an industry that is well able to pay. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The sales figures are up. However, they indicate that the changes have had the desired environmental impact because people are switching to smaller cars.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked about future changes in vehicle registration tax. Deputy Noonan and others referred to the Single Market. Historically even with the increase in the budget, the present rates of vehicle registration tax are still lower than when the tax was first introduced. It is better structured. On 1 January 1993 the vehicle registration tax rates were 25.75 per cent for cars under 2012cc and 31.80 per cent for cars with a capacity greater than that. At present the highest rate for vehicle registration tax is 30 per cent for cars greater than 2000cc, reducing to 22.5 per cent for cars less than 1400cc.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan wants me to indicate my plans for the taxation of the motor industry in the coming year. I suppose Members would like me to <Col N="165" /> announce my future actions on the price of drink and various other VAT and excise changes. Much as I know the Deputies gave force to their argument, I know that were they in my position they would have no intention of announcing future changes. No sane Minister for Finance would do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised ecological concerns suggesting that increases in vehicle registration tax was not the way to make an impact on the environment. He suggests that people should continue to buy cars but use them less frequently. I do not see why a person would buy a car if he or she was not going to use it &ndash; perhaps to look at it in the garage. A friend of mine has a car which he takes out for a drive irregularly but this man has many other things to worry about and only occasionally makes a long journey. However most people use the car to go about their business. I accept that in the context of a transport policy we could have fewer cars clogging up the streets, and I have ideas on that which I outlined last year. I do not accept the arguments put forward by Deputy McDowell on car use.</P>
    <P>I have formed the view that lobbyists succeed when speaking on behalf of groups that are well organised and from the middle and upper classes. They are likely also to get a response from Deputies across all parties who then put pressure on the Minister. They are also successful in putting the point across in the media. The job of a Minister, however, is to take on board the views of those who do not have successful lobbying organisations such as pensioners, the old, the sick and others who have no one to speak for them. Some of the lobbying has been a bit over the top. Deputy Deenihan who has many years experience of marking footballers from all over the country has studied their form for a long time and that probably stands to him as a politician and perhaps his assessment of my form is better than others when he suggests how I react. A Minister must take account of a wide range of considerations especially on behalf of those who do not have others to lobby on their behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to two points the Minister made in the course of his contribution. He tore the guts out of any ecological argument he wanted to make. Owning a car is not a problem and does not cause environmental damage. What causes the damage is the use of the car. If I use my car to come into Leinster House five days a week I cause environmental damage. However, if I leave it at home and use it for social reasons at the weekend I cause less environmental damage. It is the use of the car and the road space that causes the environmental damage, not as the Minister said, owning a car. To approach the issue from an environmental point of view one looks at pricing road usage and petrol. I accept that these are not easy political issues but if the Minister is genuinely serious about environmental policy that is the way to go. From the environmental point of view there is a perfectly <Col N="166" /> persuasive reason for the Minister to state his intentions for the coming years. I presume if the reasoning relates to the environment the Minister would want to discourage some practices and encourage others. That will simply not happen if the Minister makes up his mind from year to year.</P>
      <P>However, if people are told petrol will be taxed more in the coming years or vehicle registration tax will increase on larger cars people can base their judgment on the Minister's policy statement. The policy has to be stated for two or three years in advance instead of the Minister taking a piecemeal approach. For those reasons, the Minister's status as an eco-warrior is not well established.</P>

      <P>&mdash;such as old age pensioners, the unemployed, widows and widowers, because this will affect them more than it will people who can easily afford a car. I am concerned about people who have to borrow money to buy cars and I will continue to fight this battle for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said someone had to pay but motorists and the motor industry is already contributing over £2 billion to the economy. This is one of the most productive sectors in revenue terms and it provides easy money. The Irish motorist drives on the worst roads in Europe, especially in rural areas. I have sympathy for the motorists in my constituency, where there are probably the worst roads in Ireland, who pay the same tax as people in Dublin who have better facilities. As we all know from driving here in the morning, urban motorists now leave an hour earlier than previously to get to work. They sit in gridlock, suffering from tension and frustration as a result of taking an hour to travel four miles.</P>
      <P>Rural and urban motorists are penalised by paying high tax &ndash; 61 per cent of the cost of a car is taxation, including VRT and VAT. Cars in Ireland are about 25 per cent dearer than in most European countries. We thought we were moving towards harmonisation but at a European conference the Minister said that is not what a single European market is about. Perhaps he was misquoted. We want to protect European consumers and give them an equitable deal, and one thing they all buy is a car. We may not have a common language but we all drive. Car ownership in Ireland is far lower per person than in Europe or Britain. To catch up to car ownership rates in Europe, our people would have to buy a lot more cars, and if they do that they will be penalised.</P>
      <P>The reason most cars bought have engines smaller than 1.4 litres is that more young people are working and they buy smaller cars. It is they who are fuelling the economy. Perhaps the Minister could have research carried out to confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The Minister recalled when VRT rates were far higher, but that was when the economy was in recession and, to keep the country funded, various Governments had to find money where they could. We now have a surplus of £1.5 billion. Why should motorists be penalised for the sake of £13 million, which the Minister could make up elsewhere? It is a small amount of money in terms of the surplus at his disposal.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the debate as there are other amendments, but this one is particularly important for consumers. The Minister could have accepted it because of the arguments we have made. It is reasonable and would not have cost much money. I am disappointed he has rejected it. As Deputy Noonan said, if we want people to buy better cars and to have cleaner air, we should use the carrot rather than the stick approach, as the scrappage scheme showed. The introduction of compulsory car testing will put more pressure on people to get better cars. They will be forced to buy second-hand cars rather than new ones, and the number of imported second hand-cars will increase. The Minister also <Col N="168" /> said the 1.4 litre engine size is a natural dividing line for VRT rates but I do not know where he got that idea &ndash; 1.6 litres is a more natural divide, as I said earlier.</P>
    <P>This is not a green tax and the Minister's party's candidates in Dublin will not get one extra vote because of it. I understand the Minister accepted the Green Party's proposals on VRT but he is not tackling the issue of emissions. He says he does not accept all his officials' advice but in this instance he has not followed his own reasoning. There is no long-term or even medium-term strategy in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I will put this amendment to a vote. The Minister's party colleagues will have to vote against my amendment and then outline to consumers, not to dealers, the tax proportion of the cost of cars. Motorists are badly treated. Ireland will become the dustbin of Europe as a result of the second-hand cars which will be dumped here. This increase is contradictory from an environmental point of view.</P>

      <P>The aim of the amendment is to exclude flat-rate farmers involved in making supplies of pig semen from the requirement to register and account for VAT. For technical, drafting reasons the amendment does not achieve the result intended. On Committee Stage I undertook to table a Report Stage amendment to cater <Col N="171" /> for the concerns of the pig industry in this matter. My amendment achieves the desired result by restricting the requirement to register and account for VAT to flat-rate farmers involved in the sale of bovine semen.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Finance Act introduced a requirement for farmers involved in the supply of livestock semen to register and account for VAT. This change was mainly intended to tackle VAT induced distortions between farmers and non-farmers in the bovine trade. It is now clear that the scope of the 1998 provision was too broad. While there was a clear and well documented case of tax based distortion in the case of sales of bovine semen, there has been no comparable case of distortion in sales other than bovine. The best option is to restrict the application of the provision to bovine semen.</P>

      <P>I said on Committee Stage that we have traditionally directed assistance at the industry to encourage building. While that is not necessary at present, it is necessary to direct assistance at specific types of buyers.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus in the House that we should seek to assist first time buyers and I proposed two measures in that regard. First, if the first time buyers' grant is to be retained for new houses it should also apply to second-hand houses. Second, the alleviation of relief from stamp duty which applies to first time buyers of new houses should also apply to second-hand houses.

    <P>When this matter was raised on Committee Stage I advised that the reason new houses have been treated differently from second-hand houses for stamp duty purposes is that new houses are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent, whereas the sale of a second hand house does not incur VAT. In addition, the concessionary treatment of new houses also acts as a support to the building industry. I would be reluctant to move in the <Col N="173" /> direction sought by the Deputy in the absence of any detailed information on how the measure would affect that industry.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that it does not conform with the recommendations set out in the first Bacon report which I implemented last year in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998. Apart from these considerations, this proposal would significantly reduce the yield from property. The estimated annual cost of the proposal would be approximately £60 to £70 million. For these reasons, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also raised the question of the capital gains tax change introduced in earlier amendments on foot of the second Bacon report published yesterday. The Government reacted speedily to the first Bacon report in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998. No Bill was produced so quickly following the publication of a report.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the first Bacon report was to speed up the supply of land. Both Bacon reports concentrate heavily on the supply side. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, was also necessary to implement tax changes to distort the market in a specific direction. In his second report, Dr. Bacon confirms these measures have had some success. The emphasis has been on increasing the supply side to return supply and demand to equilibrium.</P>
    <P>The first Bacon report recommended a temporary reduction to 20 per cent in the rate of capital gains tax for those disposing of land for the purpose of house building to be followed by an increase to 60 per cent after 5 April 2002, if houses were not built by then. This was implemented in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, subject to the condition that planning permission had to be obtained. This was to ensure that houses were built. At the time I considered this was the only way to proceed with this recommendation.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that designated zoning takes place in every county or borough. For example, county development plans may not have specific rezonings such as occur in Dublin. They may proceed on a case by case basis, for example, by designating zoning around a specific town.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures recommended by Dr. Bacon in his first report and implemented in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, have had some success. When he was asked to revisit the matter of planning permission he pointed out in his report yesterday that the requirement was causing difficulties and delays. In the course of the debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill, I said outline planning permission would suffice. That is the case.</P>
    <P>However, according to Dr. Bacon &ndash; there is evidence to support this &ndash; when developers offer to purchase land from farmers for housing development, the farmer applies for outline planning permission, which may take six to eight months to procure, following which the developer has to apply for full planning permission to build, which could take another 18 months to two years. This would mean a considerable delay from the <Col N="174" /> time the land was offered for sale to the building of a house. In view of this, Dr. Bacon advocated the removal of the requirement for outline planning permission. The amendment on Report Stage adopts this approach and it will no longer be a requirement when availing of the 20 per cent rate for capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell has raised a legitimate question. Last year I and my officials, and officials from Revenue, spent considerable time trying to speed up the enactment of the Finance (No. 2) Bill to implement the first Bacon report as quickly as possible. We considered all of these matters. My purpose in requiring planning permission was to ensure houses would be built on the relevant site. Dr. Bacon did not suggest this in his report. At the time it was the only requirement I could think of to ensure houses would be built. The earlier amendment takes account of the second Bacon report and deletes this requirement to speed up the process. It should be successful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan proposed an amendment on Committee Stage regarding capital gains tax for industrial development. It gave me the opportunity to outline my views on the tax in general and they have not changed in a week.</P>

      <P>There was a recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding designated areas. Before that there had been a lengthy delay, partly because of a continuing delay at EU level regarding one aspect of the incentives for urban renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also the reason the Minster for the Environment and Local Government delayed announcing the designated areas, even with limited incentives. Since before the 1994 tranche of renewal I have been pressing for the village of Inchicore to be designated for renewal because it has been destroyed by drugs, mainly because the Department of Health and Children has had a drugs agency located there for so long, and the complete mismanagement by Dublin Corporation of St. Michael's Estate, which is now being closed. There are sites for which planning permission has been approved which are ready for an urban renewal scheme, yet they have been excluded. It is almost certain the work will not go ahead because the neighbouring sites have been designated under the scheme. Given the dereliction in Inchicore &ndash; this also applies elsewhere &ndash; I cannot understand why it deliberately went <Col N="175" /> out of its way to exclude areas which were ready for buildings and needed development.</P>
      <P>Other parts of the village should have been designated because they are run down due to bad public policy. I discussed this with Deputy Noonan when he was Minister for Health and with his predecessors. This problem was inflicted on Inchicore by a well meaning chemist in the area who initiated a methadone replacement programme long before anyone else would do so. The result was that more than 500 drug addicts from throughout the country were serviced there and it destroyed the village. That, together with a bad allocation policy of Dublin Corporation which I fought for years, destroyed good flats which must be closed at enormous expense.</P>
      <P>Official depredation destroyed the village of Inchicore. Prior to 1994 I pleaded with the then Minister for Finance and Minister for the Environment to visit Inchicore to see how it was destroyed, but they overlooked it. At least it is now included to some extent, but the areas which are ready for an urban renewal scheme have been excluded. I ask the Minister to review that decision as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>My recall of Dr. Bacon's first report was that there was no recommendation to reduce capital gains tax, that it was the Minister's initiative which was introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act and that whatever conditions he attached to the proposal were his own because the proposal was his own. It was not that the Minister was trying to get away with applying a Bacon recommendation.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected. The Minister is right to do what he is doing. When we were debating the Finance (No. 2) Act, I said it would not work and land would not be brought in for housing purposes if planning permission had to be applied. It is a pity we cannot talk in more detail about it today. Most land is sold subject to planning permission. If the contract is subject to planning permission, will capital gains tax at 20 per cent apply to the original landowner or the builder in the event of a subsequent sale?</P>

      <P>The same rule will apply. If it was a building company, it could be a tradable activity but if it was a sale by an individual to an individual, the rate would be 20 per cent unless the person buying it and selling it on again could be deemed to be a trader in land, like a trader in sweets or cigarettes. However, that would be unlikely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention that 20 to 25 per cent of the prestige apartment blocks on the south side of the city, from the block opposite Kitty O'Shea's pub through Ballsbridge, are empty. Someone should address this supply issue. Many of them are section 23 apartments against which they can write off rental income from elsewhere. With prices rising rapidly, there is a big capital gain. Investors are beginning to regard tenants in these blocks and rent as a nuisance.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look at what is being done throughout the UK, but particularly in London as it is a London problem. Commercial rates are applied on a month by month basis to apartments which are left vacant. In other words, if they are vacant for a year, an annual commercial rate is paid and if they are vacant for a month, one twelfth of the annual commercial rate is paid.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is examining the Bacon recommendation to give tenants tax exemptions on their rent, he should look at what is happening in the market. The £500 exemption is being written off elsewhere. People are not claiming it because one landlord says he will increase the rent if it is claimed, while another says he will only charge rent for 11 months because he would prefer not to be reported. The Minister must apply a monthly criterion no matter what way it is applied.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the issue of empty apartments. There must be 400 or 500 units on the south side of the city at a time when there is a shortage of rental accommodation. People are keeping apartments because they can get tax benefits but they do not rent them because they regard tenants as a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that section 23 relief would not have applied in that area. Since July 1992 section 23 relief has only applied to urban designated areas. I am not a learned economist like Dr. Bacon but I try to rationalise why people might leave apartments vacant. I accept the point the Deputy made in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some people bought apartments in tax designated areas to keep down their income tax. However, they will be part of the supply side in the medium to long-term. They might enjoy a tax break for a few years and they might regard renting as a nuisance, but they will only gain if a punter is willing to buy the apartment for a particular purpose. If the market gets out of step in the longer term, it will not work. The Deputy is right that people bought apartments for tax reasons and that they regard rent and tenants as a nuisance. However, the situation should balance out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his second report Dr. Bacon made recommendations about possible increases in the rent relief taxation area. While I am responding to the change in capital gains tax, there is no commitment to increase tax relief in the rented area. It will be considered in the budgetary context. The Deputy adverted to other things which should <Col N="177" /> also be considered in that context. I want to consider those before proposing any changes and that is why I did not table an amendment in that regard today.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Jim Mitchell's point, in this era of openness, transparency and accountability the previous Government recommended and this Government supported the proposal that urban renewal areas should be proposed by local authorities and submitted to an expert panel which would recommend them to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who would recommend them to the Government. The expert panel recommended these areas and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not change one comma. Unfortunately, Inchicore, for which the Deputy made a great case, was not included.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>In page 295, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 59 of the Finance Act, 1985, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3) For the purposes of this section, the expression a spouse of the disponer shall include any person who immediately prior to the death of the disponer was one member of a couple, of whom the disponer was the other member, who, although not married to each other, ordinarily co-habitated with each other as man and wife for a period of two years or more ending on the death of the disponer.'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Paragraph 1 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition at the end of the definition of class threshold of the words and provided further that for these purposes a person shall be deemed to be a child of the disponer if he is a child of any person who immediately prior to the death of the dis<Col N="178" /> poner was one member of a couple, of whom the disponer was the other member, who, although not married to each other, ordinarily co-habitated with each other as man and wife for a period of two years or more ending on the death of the disponer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 74 in the name of Deputy Olivia Mitchell and myself states that for tax purposes, co-habitees will be treated as if they were married. We raised this issue on Committee Stage but the Minister was reluctant to deal with it. His primary reason for not doing so was that tax law should not move in advance of civil law, or words to that effect. That principle does not stand up to analysis and arrangements can be made in tax law which do not have to reflect a wider attitude introduced through social legislation in the House.</P>
    <P>Rather than trying to make a fundamental root and branch change of the status of partnerships and confer on them a different status, a more focused approach would be to address the tax problem and simply provide a resolution to it. If it is treated as a general issue of principle, it will not be possible to make any progress until the status of the partnership is changed. Amendment No. 76 is a good example of that where children of partners, because they are not defined as stepchildren, cannot avail of certain benefits of which stepchildren would avail. I pointed out in great detail on Committee Stage the difficulties attached to this. One solution would be for the spouse to adopt the child of the partner but if the child is already adopted by the mother, it cannot be re-adopted. There is no solution to this problem other than changing the definition and there is no general principle in law that can be introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to resolve this problem. The proposal that tax law should not move in advance of the law in general is a mandate to do nothing. We should address the anomalies in tax law where the nature of relationships justify them and where there is no injury to any third party. The amount of tax foregone is minor because these are anomalies in exceptional cases. The cases I am talking about concern stepchildren and one could count on the fingers of one hand the number of instances to which this would apply, but it is important to those to whom it does apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to the discussion on Committee Stage, the Minister made the point that we could not deal with this in a piecemeal fashion. I would argue that we have to deal with cases of hardship and it is not difficult to identify some of those. Deputy Noonan pointed to one in relation to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case is that of co-habiting couples who own a house which is effectively their family home and where it causes immediate hardship to the surviving partner when the other person dies, even if the house is in both names. The likelihood is that they will be obliged, because of the low threshold in inheritance tax in those circum<Col N="179" /> stances, to sell the house shortly after a partner has died.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there is a general principle of application. If we wait for that to be resolved this case of hardship will not be dealt with and it will require a courageous Minister to examine cases where there is disproportionate hardship and to at least attempt to deal with those cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice to put on record if one has a vested interest. I am a co-habitee so I would be affected by these proposed changes, particularly those put forward by Deputy McDowell.</P>
      <P>The intention of these amendments is twofold. First, to provide that co-habiting couples in non-marital relationships will be treated as spouses for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax. Second, that the child of one of the partners in a non-marital relationship will be regarded as the child of the other partner for the purposes of the tax.</P>
      <P>While at face value it would seem equitable to accord the same tax treatment to co-habiting couples as is accorded to married couples, there are substantial legal and administrative problems to be overcome, particularly in the area of defining in legal terms what would constitute a co-habiting couple. The same problems arise in determining the tax treatment of a child of one of the partners of a co-habiting couple in receipt of a gift or inheritance from the other partner.</P>
      <P>With the advent of divorce many co-habiting couples will be able to marry. Where co-habiting couples decide not to marry or cannot do so for legal reasons, any extension of the &ldquo;married&rdquo; treatment for capital acquisitions tax purposes would involve recognising relationships in the tax code which have not been recognised in the context of general law. In general, it is not appropriate for tax law to pre-empt general law.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the tax treatment available to spouses must take cognisance of general law. An interdepartmental working group has been established, chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, to examine the treatment of married, co-habiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. Consideration of tax measures in this area will await the group's report which is expected to be completed later this year. For these reasons I regretfully oppose these amendments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan, when speaking on these amendments on Committee Stage, mentioned the case of a woman with a non-marital child marrying someone who is not the father of the child. In these circumstances I am advised the child would qualify as a stepchild of its mother's spouse by virtue of section 3 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, and section 74 of the Finance Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke also of a case which had been brought to his attention where the mother had adopted her own child before marrying. I am advised that such a child would also qualify as a <Col N="180" /> stepchild of its mother's spouse by virtue of section 2(5) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>On the general issue that relationships should not be recognised in tax law which are not recognised in general law, I am not sure that is an absolute principle on which the Minister can rely. I would have thought the relationships would be already recognised in general law in so far as common law recognises relationships. They may not be recognised in constitutional law but I would think they are recognised in common law. The Minister should not press that too far as the reason he cannot deal with hardship cases. If we are waiting for change in the general law in respect of some situations, there will not be any change because the position is not remediable through statute law and the anomaly will have to be dealt with for the particular case. I know hardship cases make bad law but there are situations where it is the only approach to resolve a problem.</P>

    <P>&lsquo;58A. (1) In this section&ndash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Family Home&rdquo; means any property which if the donee or successor were the owner prior to the gift or inheritance would be the principal private residence of such person within the meaning of section 604 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Family Member&rdquo; means a child, brother, sister or child of a brother or sister or a person in respect of whom the disponer stands in <i>loco parentis</i> who is domiciled in the State and in respect of whom not more than 50 per cent of the market value of the property to which the individual is beneficially entitled in possession, excluding any pension or death in service rights payable to the donee or successor on the death of the disponer or spouse of the disponer, is represented by the market value of property in the State which consists of a family home. For the purpose of this definition a deduction shall be made from the market value of a family home for any debts or incumbrances;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taxable Value of a Family Home&rdquo; means the market value of the property reduced by 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>(2) In so far as any gift or inheritance consists of a family home:</P>
    <P>(a) at the date of the gift or at the date of the inheritance, and</P>
    <P>(b) at the valuation date,</P>
    <P>and is taken by a donee or successor who is, on the valuation date and after taking the gift or inheritance, a family member, the provisions of section 18 (other than subsection 7(b) thereof) shall apply in relation to a family home as they apply in relation to other property subject to the following modifications:</P>
    <P>(i) in subsection (1) of that section, the reference to market value shall be construed as a reference to the taxable value of a family home;</P>
    <P>(ii) where a deduction is made for any liability, cost or expense in accordance with subsection (1) of that section only a proportion of such liability cost or expense shall be deducted and that proportion shall be the proportion that the taxable value of a family home bears to the market value of that property; and</P>
    <P>(iii) where a deduction is to be made for <Col N="182" /> any consideration under subsection (2) or (4)(b) of that section, only a proportion of such consideration shall be deducted and that proportion shall be the proportion that the taxable value of a family home bears to the market value of that property.</P>
    <P>(3) Where a taxable gift or a taxable inheritance is taken by a donee or successor who is a family member subject to the condition that the whole or part thereof will be invested in a family home and such condition is complied with within two years after the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance, then the gift or inheritance shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have consisted &ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) at the date of the gift or at the date of the inheritance; and</P>
    <P>(b) at the valuation date,</P>
    <P>of a family home to the extent to which the gift or inheritance is subject to such condition and has been so invested.</P>
    <P>(4) (a) The taxable value of a family home shall cease to be applicable to a family home if and to the extent that such property, or any family home which directly or indirectly replaces such property:</P>
    <P>(i) is sold or compulsorily acquired within the period of ten years after the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance, and</P>
    <P>(ii) is not replaced within a year of the sale or compulsory acquisition, by another family home,</P>
    <P>and tax shall be chargeable in respect of the gift or inheritance as if the property was not property which qualified for this relief:</P>

    <P>The Minister has already recognised in the Finance Bill the taxation difficulties being experienced by certain classes of taxpayer as a result of rising property prices in Dublin. He substantially increased the threshold in respect of collecting arrears of residential property tax. That is evidence that he understands the problem I am discussing.</P>
    <P>The same case applies, in a more onerous way, to persons who inherit the family home in which they live and who are faced with an impossible tax bill because of the rising price of property in Dublin. This lengthy amendment proposes to deal with that by defining the taxable value of a family home as the market value of the property reduced by 90 per cent. It would have the effect of substantially relieving from inheritance tax persons who inherit a family home.</P>
    <P>The length of the amendment is dictated by the fact that all avenues for evasion are blocked. It is tightly focused on somebody who inherits the family home who is already living in that family home. It only applies in those circumstances. The house would have to be used as a family home.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there are sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces and persons to whom the person who bequeathes the home is <i>in loco parentis</i> in this <Col N="184" /> situation. These people find it increasingly difficult to pay the inheritance tax bill that arises as a result of a bequest.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister takes this issue on board. He should indicate how he intends to deal with this situation as it is causing great hardship. Nobody wants a person who has lived for 30 or 40 years in the family home to be obliged to sell it simply because they are unable to pay the tax bill. It is not like inheriting land. The person cannot sell a site or a field; either it all goes or it stays. People should not be forced out of their homes.</P>
    <P>I do not want this provision to be spun into a relief for investment property or second houses or holiday homes. The amendment is tightly focused on the category of people who are suffering hardship. I recommend it to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The thrust of the amendment is sound. The problem identified by Deputy Noonan is real. When the thresholds were first established, particularly the parent to child threshold, they did not catch the vast majority of houses. However, they now apply to an increasing number of houses and that was never the intention.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I consider the amendment too generous. A reduction to 10 per cent of the market value would seriously damage the take from inheritance tax. It would effectively tear the heart out of inheritance tax and I do not wish to be part of that.</P>
      <P>However, the problem should be examined and perhaps a less generous concession could be considered in the future.</P>

      <P>The intention of this amendment is to reduce the value of a house, the subject of a gift or inheritance, by 90 per cent provided (a) the beneficiary is a child, brother or sister, nephew or niece of the disponer, (b) the beneficiary occupies the house for ten years afterwards as his or her principal private residence and (c) the value of the house represents more than 50 per cent of the beneficiary's total wealth excluding any death in service benefit payable on the death of the disponer.</P>
      <P>I note that the amendment specifies that the value of the house should represent not more than 50 per cent of the beneficiary's wealth. I presume this is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that business and agricultural property qualify for a 90 per cent reduction for capital acquisitions tax purposes, I am not sure that similar treatment should be accorded to someone inheriting a family home. In the interests of tackling unemployment and reducing the overall rate of income tax, it has been the policy of successive Governments to increase the yield from capital taxation while at the same time introducing a measure of relief in particular circumstances where the existing burden was perceived to be causing hardship. In last year's Fin<Col N="185" /> ance Bill I increased the elderly siblings relief to 80 per cent of the value of a residence or £150,000, whichever is the lesser, and introduced a new relief for those inheriting their principal private residence from a close relative along the lines of the elderly siblings relief but subject to a ten year occupation requirement instead of a five year requirement.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that this amendment, if confined to gift and inheritance of houses, would cost in the region of £15 million out of a current yield from mainstream capital acquisitions tax of approximately £83 million. The amendment actually goes further to the extent that it would grant the same relief to an inheritance of cash provided the cash was invested in the residence. This would increase the cost substantially.</P>
    <P>A great deal of thought went into the drafting of the amendment. As Deputy Noonan pointed out, the intention is to focus it tightly and narrowly. I appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment. Increasing property values have outstripped the thresholds which were set many years ago and updated since then.</P>
    <P>In my two budgets to date, I have addressed specific aspects of the overall taxation system. I made slight amendments last year to an extension of what could be termed the elderly siblings relief to overcome particular problems in that regard. I acknowledge the problems being caused for some people by the current low thresholds. I promise to address this matter in future budgets but I cannot accept the relief at this stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;195.&ndash;Section 19(1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition after the word 'incumbrances' in the definition of a farmer of the words &lsquo;or is a person who comes within the definition of &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; in section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994'.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is to broaden the definition of the term &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; in section 19(1) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, which provides for a relief from tax on the transfer of qualifying agricultural property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> The relief operates by reducing by 90 per cent the market value of agricultural property which is the subject of a gift or inheritance so that tax is calculated by reference to an amount &ndash; known as the agricultural value &ndash; which is substantially less than the open market value of such property. One of the conditions of the relief is that the gift or inheritance of agricultural property must be taken by a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; as defined in the section. A &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; is defined as an individual who is domiciled in Ireland, at least 80 per cent of the gross market value of whose assets is represented by agricultural property after taking the gift or inheritance.</P>
    <P>The requirement that 80 per cent of an individual's assets comprise agricultural property ensures that the relief is focused on genuine farmers rather than on individuals with substantial holdings of non-agricultural assets who may be engaged in farming.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment would broaden the scope of the relief by extending it to gifts or inheritances taken by &ldquo;young trained farmers&rdquo; as defined by section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994. Section 112 provides for a relief from stamp duty on transfers of land to young trained farmers. A &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is defined as an individual who is under 35 years of age on the date of execution of the deed of transfer and who holds one of the qualifications specified in the schedule of qualifications accompanying the section.</P>
    <P>Extending the availability of agricultural relief to young trained farmers would mean that individuals with substantial holdings of non-agricultural assets could qualify for capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief. Such an extension would therefore blur the focus of the relief by making it available to individuals who farm rather than to genuine farmers. For this reason I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>This relief is for the transfer of agricultural property. This amendment proposes that for the purposes of this Act and to qualify for the 90 per cent relief a farmer is defined as being in a particular category. This amendment seeks to include in the definition of farmer a young trained farmer. For the reasons I outlined this would broaden the focus of the relief and for that reason I am not inclined to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital acquisitions tax relief on the transfer of <Col N="187" /> agricultural property is very generous. That relief has been in place for some years, but the generosity of Deputy McDowell's leader knew no bounds when it came to extending relief for the transfer of agricultural property and businesses. If Deputy McDowell had been Minister for Finance, I am sure he would not have been as generous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We pointed out the difficulty most farmer families are experiencing in encouraging any member of the family to take over the running of the farm. There are requirements under law in the case of installation aid and the Minister referred to stamp duty, where to qualify a young person undergoes training. If a young farmer intends to take over the running of the family farm for the purpose of farming and his or her bona fides has been established by undergoing the appropriate training, even if he or she has other assets, agricultural relief on the transfer of agricultural property should apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be talking at cross purposes. Young trained farmers would probably qualify under the assets test I outlined earlier. The requirement that 80 per cent of an individual's assets be comprised of agricultural property ensures that the relief is focused on genuine farmers rather than individuals who have substantial holdings of non-agricultural assets who may be engaged in farming. A young trained farmer would normally qualify under the assets test. The purpose of this amendment is to reduce that qualification to make it easier for a young trained farmer to qualify where he or she has non-agricultural assets.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The relief is very generous. In effect, it is a 90 per cent rebate. The test of having non-agricultural assets is reasonable under the conditions. To extend it further for a young trained farmer would not be desirable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have specific cases in mind where problems have arisen and that may be the reason he tabled this amendment. I could not agree to further concessions on agricultural relief.</P>
      <P>My views on capital acquisition tax are not far removed from my views on all other taxes, which I outlined on many occasions. I am sure the Deputy would be opposed to any changes I might introduce in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister announced his intention to rebase inheritance tax by bringing forward the year in which it was based to 1987. The intention behind this amendment is to do that on a rolling basis whereby one would count back 12 years from the date in which an inheritance or gift was taken to aggregate one's tax liability. I propose this amendment not on the basis of principle but for practical reasons. It becomes <Col N="189" /> difficult at a certain point for practitioners to have to go back 15 or 20 years to aggregate a lifetime of gifts or inheritances. From a purely practical point of view, 12 years is probably an adequate period. We do not run too much of a risk of people using that lengthy a period as a tax shelter. I consider this a reasonable proposition.</P>

      <P>I brought forward this proposal at budget time for the reasons outlined by the Deputy. It was another of my great initiatives. I suggested it because such aggregation is cumbersome for practitioners, particularly those in the Deputy's profession. I put forward the idea of introducing a rolling relief, as outlined by the Deputy, on a ten or 12 year basis or 12 years. My officials said this would give rise to tax planning opportunities and that is the reason that section is framed as it is. I am prepared to revisit this proposal in the context of next year's Finance Bill for the reasons I outlined.</P>

      <P>The two amendments would have the effect of introducing a small inheritance allowance, a <i>de minimus</i> allowance. Any gift is aggregatable for the calculation of inheritance tax purposes or gift tax purposes. This amendment requires the Minister to introduce a small inheritance allowance and to increase the existing small gift allowance from £1,000 to £5,000. A sum of £1,000 is too small. We should encourage people to buy and sell stocks up to a reasonable limit annually without incuring a tax liability. That is something we can reasonably do.</P>
      <P>There is also the practical problem of aggregating inheritance tax and gift tax. It is necessary to aggregate all small gifts going back almost an indeterminable period to assess the tax liability, even if those gifts would be lower than any of the existing thresholds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of amendment <Col N="190" /> No. 80 is to introduce a small inheritance exemption similar to that which operates for small gifts. At present a gift of up to £500 in any one year may be taken by a donee from a disponer without incurring a charge to capital acquisitions tax. I have increased this threshold to £1,000 in this year's Finance Bill. However, no such exemption operates in relation to inheritance tax.</P>
      <P>The extension of such an exemption to include small inheritances could open up substantial possibilities for tax planning. A discretionary trust set up under a will trust could be used to appoint assets valued at £1,000 in successive years over a prolonged period of time and by doing so avoid a charge to mainstream inheritance tax. It would also be difficult to avoid extending the £1,000 exemption to all inheritances, thereby increasing the various thresholds by this amount. The cost of such a global exemption would be approximately £1.8 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Existing class threshold can already exempt an inheritance of up to £192,900 from tax. The intention of amendment No. 88 is to increase the small gift exemption from capital acquisitions tax from £1,000 to £5,000. In section 199 of the Bill I have increased the small gift exemption from capital acquisitions tax from £500 to £1,000. This exemption applies on an annual basis so that yearly gifts of up to £1,000 taken by a donee from a disponer will be free of tax. Increasing the exemption to £5,000 per annum would make it possible for a substantial amount of cash or assets to be transferred over time without incurring a charge to capital acquisitions tax. For these reasons I am opposing both amendments.</P>

      <P>There is a valid argument in what the Minister said.

The intention of this amendment is to accord to an inheritance taken by a parent from a child the same tax treatment as an inheritance taken by one spouse from the other, in other words to exempt it from capital acquisitions tax, although I understand from Deputy McDowell that is not the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> Section 116 of the Finance Act, 1991, already exempts inheritances taken by parents from their children. There are two conditions attaching to the relief: the interest taken by the parent or parents must be an absolute interest and not a limited interest and the inheritance must be taken on the date of the death of the child. In view of the availability of the relief provided by section 116 of the Finance Act, 1991, there is no requirement for any further provision in this regard. For this reason I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    <P>The intention of amendment No. 87 is to exempt from capital acquisitions tax gifts or inheritances taken by a parent from a child for the purpose of support or maintenance. Section 58 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, already exempts from tax gifts or payments made to a dependent relative, as defined by section 466 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, during the lifetime of the disponer for the purposes of maintenance or support, provided the gifts or payments are not excessive given the financial circumstances of the disponer.</P>
    <P>The existing exemption goes much of the way towards addressing the concerns which gave rise to this amendment. Furthermore, the amendment as proposed places no limit whatsoever on the size of the gifts or inheritances that might qualify for exemption other than that the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that the payments are applied towards such maintenance. For those reasons I am opposing this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight.</P>
      <P>In light of a front page article in <i>The Examiner</i> today which reported an unacceptable level of radon gas occurring in a Kerry household, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must move quickly to give assurances to people that they will be assisted in eliminating this highly dangerous gas from their homes.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland discovered in a recent survey that occupants in a Kerry household were being exposed to 1,924 becquerels of radon gas per cubic metre. A reading of anything over 200 becquerels is considered to be a risk and, in this particular case, the risk was equivalent to more than double the maximum permissible in the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radon gas is a naturally occurring substance which is generally found in abundance in areas where the table rock consists of granite, and Kerry is among the areas in Ireland where radon gas levels are unacceptably high. Radon gas is responsible for more than 10 per cent of lung cancer deaths each year in Ireland. Approximately 200 deaths occur each year as a result of radon gas. It is up to the Government of the day to <Col N="195" /> ensure that people are assisted in carrying out remedial work on their homes to eliminate this gas. As the Minister of State is no doubt aware, under the last Administration a grant scheme was put in place to allow householders to draw down a grant to fund 50 per cent of the work required to eliminate radon gas. This grant was administered up to a maximum of £800 per house.</P>
    <P>While in itself the grant was relatively minimal, it did give people some assistance in ridding their homes of this dangerous gas. When this grant scheme was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, it was supposed to last for ten years and funding was secured from the Department of Finance to this effect. The pathetic excuse by this Government that overall budgetary constraints have not made it possible to provide for the scheme this year is nothing short of a disgrace, given promises in the House that the grant would be reintroduced in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>In this buoyant and thriving economy, I believe that the Government is in a position to administer this grant and has a responsibility to do so. The Government has been quick to remind house builders of their new responsibilities regarding radon gas protection, and rightly so. However, before lectures are delivered to the building industry this Government should look at its own despicable record on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland estimates that one in ten of all homes are likely to have radon gas levels exceeding what is considered safe. Given this serious problem, it is appalling that this Government has scrapped this important scheme to counter the health threat caused by radon gas.</P>
    <P>In light of the media coverage of the frightening levels of radon gas found in Kerry and other areas of the country, I believe that this Government has a responsibility to act immediately. Tonight I will not accept no for an answer. People do not choose to inhale radon gas, and they do not deserve to suffer the appalling and agonising pain caused by lung cancer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising this important matter. I am aware of the findings of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in relation to the levels of radon gas found in various parts of the country which have been surveyed by the institute to date. The radon reading in County Kerry referred to by the Deputy was detected in the course of the national radon survey undertaken by the RPII. The results for Kerry were published last July and of the 932 houses in County Kerry that participated in the survey, 52 were found to be above the national reference level for radon concentrations of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. One house was detected as having a reading of 1924 becquerels per cubic metre. This single reading is <Col N="196" /> unusually high as the average reading for Kerry is 70 becquerels per cubic metre.</P>
      <P>This type of reading is not representative of trends across the country. However, high readings have been detected in other counties. Anomalies can occur for a number of reasons, including geological features such as the house being situated on or near known granite deposits. The interaction between air pressure in the house and pressure from the ground beneath the house can also play a major role in the amount of indoor radon present. These factors can vary from house to house and indeed neighbouring houses can have substantially different radon readings.</P>
      <P>Radon is a naturally-occurring radioactive gas which has been present in many countries in Europe and elsewhere for a very long time. It is only relatively recently that there has been a growing awareness of the potential health effects of long-term exposure to high levels of radon. The Government is aware of research which shows that long-term exposure to radon can cause lung cancer.</P>
      <P>There is also growing evidence that for people who smoke, the health risk from radon is considerably greater. The Government has taken a number of measures to create an awareness of radon and to address the problem of high radon levels in dwellings and schools.</P>
      <P>In 1990, the Government adopted an annual average radon concentration of 200 Bq/mf7&gt;3 as the national reference level. This means that above this level remediation measures to reduce the indoor radon concentration level in a dwelling should be considered.</P>
      <P>A national radon survey by the RPII was initiated in 1992. This survey is aimed at identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels and will allow the classification of the whole country on the basis of the predicted percentage of dwellings in each area which are above the reference level. Areas in which this prediction is greater than 10 per cent will be designated as high radon areas. The survey has been completed in respect of 24 counties and the results have been published by the RPII. The results for the remaining two counties, Galway and Mayo, are due to be published in April. Where readings above the reference level have been found householders have been advised by the RPII to consider taking remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government is not in a position to provide direct financial assistance to householders for radon remediation works, every effort is being made by Government to tackle the problem of high radon concentrations in dwellings. Recent radon preventative measures were introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and local authorities in the form of technical guidance documents relating to the consolidated national buildings regulations, 1997. The guidance documents call for radon protection measures to be taken in the construction of all new houses from 1 July 1998. More elabor<Col N="197" /> ate radon protection is specified for new houses situated in high radon areas.</P>
    <P>A booklet entitled &ldquo;Radon in Buildings&rdquo; is available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government which provides advice to householders and builders on preventative and remedial measures which can be undertaken in new and existing buildings to reduce high radon concentrations.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Minister for Education and Science the RPII has recently commenced a comprehensive survey of ground floor radon levels in all primary and secondary schools to ensure any problems with radon gas are identified. This survey, which commenced in September, will be carried out over the next three school years. The Minister for Education and Science will also assist schools in carrying out remediation measures which may be necessary as a result of the RPII survey. In addition to these Government initiatives, the RPII has a radon freephone for queries about radon and the RPII offer a three month radon measurement test to householders at a cost of £15.</P>
    <P>Further radon protection measures are to be introduced next year under the terms of a new EU directive on basic safety standards for the protection of workers and the general public from the dangers of ionising radiation. The directive will require the introduction of radiation protection measures to monitor, control and reduce exposures to natural sources of radiation, including radon in the workplace. My Department will issue a public consultation document later this month on how it is proposed to implement this directive.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined above indicate the Government is conscious of the importance of this issue. Furthermore, the RPII, the agency with direct responsibility for monitoring of radon levels throughout the country, is completing its survey of the problem and maintaining an appropriate campaign to inform the public of the risks. I will continue to take an active role in encouraging the RPII to continue its work of maximising public awareness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this matter. For the past 14 years I have been fortunate to be a member of a local authority but more particularly of the Southern Health Board. During that time I have never ceased to be amazed by the voluntary effort to assist State agencies, such as health boards, in providing services to those in need. If that goodwill was quenched the State could not provide out of its own resources, seven days a week, for those most in need. This voluntary effort is evident in community care, care of the elderly, meals on wheels, home helps, in the psychiatric services and in district hospitals. They carry out functions which it would be difficult for any State agency to undertake even with the best intentions. Given that in the region of £100,000 is provided in any one year by the national lottery <Col N="198" /> for distribution to such causes we must be careful to nurture that goodwill and ensure that we err on the side of generosity rather than prudence. For every pound we put into voluntary organisations we get it back 10,000-fold.</P>
      <P>The development in Charleville is a worthy cause. The application by Charleville and District Enterprise Limited is for funding for a family resource and child care centre at Broad Street, Charleville. The development is taking place on the main street in a building which has been derelict for many years. Notwithstanding its unsuccessful application to the Department last year for funding, work is under way. The committee is fundraising on a daily basis. It has a significant financial headache. Capital acquisition and site acquisition costs for the project are in the region of £600,000. Despite the committee's best endeavours to date it faces a shortfall of £200,000.</P>
      <P>The list of services to be provided in the centre include child crèche and pre-school facilities, accommodation for nine apartments for the elderly, a fully equipped catering kitchen, a chef operated modern restaurant for service provision and pre-hotel training of personnel, home care agency for qualified carers and training of home helps, after school homework supported by qualified helpers in liaison with local schools, parenting, community mothers, child health and breast feeding guidance. A facility will also be available to health board staff, namely, public health nurses, social workers, qualified counsellors, psychologists and mediation services. Given the range of services to be provided, most of which is on a voluntary basis, this is an extremely worthy application.</P>
      <P>The group is well integrated into the local community. In recent years it has worked with FÁS, community employment, the Southern Health Board, Cork County Council, the local credit union, which is supporting this application, the Convent of Mercy in Charleville, Ballyhoura Development, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>To date the Department of Health and Children has been slow to provide financial support for this application. I appeal to the Minister to recognise the role of the voluntary sector and the good work it has done. There is a shortfall of £200,000. Out of a total expenditure of £600,000 it is asking for £100,000 from the State. In view of the range of services to be provided and the funds available to the Department of Health and Children I appeal to him to look favourably on this application.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for raising this important issue. I am replying to the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Frank Fahey. On his behalf, I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on the issue of the family resource and child care centre in Char<Col N="199" /> leville, County Cork, which is sponsored by Charleville and District Enterprise Limited.</P>
      <P>Lottery funding has previously been made available by the Department of Health and Children to support this project &ndash; £15,000 was made available in 1996 and £50,000 in 1997 towards the cost of providing a new premises for the organisation. An application for lottery funding was made in 1998 but was unsuccessful and the organisation has been advised accordingly. A further application for lottery funding has been made in respect of 1999 and this is being considered.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for lottery funding far exceeds the resources available. Each application is considered on its merits, having regard to the overall funding available, the number of applications received and the level of funding previously made available in respect of a particular project.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children will be in contact with the organisation regarding the outcome of its application. Charleville and District Enterprise Limited has also received State funding under the money advice and budgeting service. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a three year contract with the organisation which has resulted in it being funded towards staffing and running costs to the level of £42,000 in 1997 and £50,000 in 1998 and there is a commitment to provide £51,000 in 1999.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is aware of the good work being done by Sr. Celestine, the organiser of the project, and by Charleville and District Enterprise Limited in providing services to the local community and he will keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this issue, the refurbishment of Kilfinane primary school. I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to the House. I was glad to be with him in Kilmallock last Friday. He was more than welcome and I hope he enjoyed his visit to the area.</P>
      <P>I now refer to an area not far from Kilmallock, it is the next parish to it. This is a very important issue for the pupils, teachers and the community at large. They wish to ensure the development and structural refurbishment of Kilfinane primary school is completed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Kilfinane primary school is a six teacher rural school with a shared remedial teacher, and the current enrolment is 163. In January 1998, the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science for a grant to carry out major structural refurbishment at the school. In January 1999, it received a reply stating that due to restricted site size and falling enrolment trends, classroom extension and conversion would not proceed. A grant was provided for indoor toilets and a staffroom was sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> The decision is unacceptable to the board of management, parents, staff and pupils of the school. They strongly reject this decision and refute the grounds on which it was made. The extension and conversion applied for in January 1998 is urgently needed and nothing less will meet the needs of the school community. I urge the Minister to re-examine this matter carefully, the case has merit and should be responded to positively.</P>
    <P>At present the following unacceptable conditions prevail in the school. Four of the six classrooms are too small. There is no space in these classrooms for sink units, a computer or TV trolley or for storage cupboards. One of these classrooms is inadequately ventilated and children regularly complain of headaches. It is proposed to amalgamate these classrooms into two large ones, a staffroom and a storage room. The school is the base school for the remedial teacher. At present the remedial teacher's room is also the staffroom, the store room for all equipment, the music room and the library. Consequently, this room is more suitable as a remedial teacher's room and the plan is to provide a separate room for the remedial teacher. The school has neither a PE hall nor an all purpose room. There is a central hall in the school but because it is small and the main thoroughfare through the school, it is highly unsuitable as an assembly or a PE hall. The plan enlarges this hall and partially eliminates it as a thoroughfare.</P>
    <P>The present building dates back to 1909 and the school is housed in a converted church. It consists of six small classrooms, three of which are only 35 square meters. There is a tiny ancillary room, which is used as a library, a tiny office and cloakroom. There is also a small central area which can be accessed from the classrooms. There is no staffroom and the toilet blocks are situated outdoors. The playing space outdoors is very limited.</P>
    <P>In addition, three of the classrooms are seven by five meters and house classes of 27, 28 and 29 pupils. The partitions between the classrooms are wafer thin consisting of narrow timber boards or glass and fail to be sound proof which, therefore, causes difficulties for teaching and learning. There is widespread evidence of plaster decay due the dampness. The timber floors have begun to sag in many areas. Due to the building design, ceilings are very high and temperature extremes are common. There is evidence of dry rot and many of the windows can no longer be opened leading to a lack of adequate ventilation. The playing space is also inadequate for the pupils and there is no drinking water available to them. Sinks are provided only in three of the rooms.</P>
    <P>There is no staffroom, proper library, principal's office or remedial teacher work base. On occasions, there is also evidence of rodent infestation. There is an urgent need to re-examine the decision of the Department of Education and Sci<Col N="201" /> ence not to fund the extension proposal of the board of management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the position as regards Kilfinane primary school. I thank him for his kind remarks in relation to my visit to Kilmallock last week, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The hospitality shown was appreciated and I was impressed with the strong education provision in Kilmallock.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this school has a staffing level of a principal and five assistant teachers, with a shared remedial teacher. The current enrolment is 163 pupils. The school's accommodation comprises six classrooms built around an assembly area, a staffroom cum remedial room, an office, teacher's toilet and cloakrooms. The boys' and girls' toilets are outdoors in a separate block. There is a preservation order on the school building which was built in 1909 and is located in The Square, Kilfinane. This would have to be taken into account in any renovation plans.</P>
      <P>In 1998 an application was received from the school by my Department for grant-aid to assist with the cost of providing a one classroom extension, indoor toilets, the conversion of the three smaller classrooms and the extension of the play area into one and the construction of a one classroom extension, including toilet facilities.</P>
      <P>The school was visited by an officer of the Office of Public Works. He reported that due to the restricted nature of the site, there is not enough space to provide a classroom extension. There is space, however, to provide a small extension comprising indoor toilets and a staff room. On 20 January 1999, my Department wrote to the school confirming that grant-aid would be provided towards the provision of this extension and advised the school that the Office of Public Works had been requested to provide professional advice for the project.</P>
      <P>The Department advised the school that due to the limited nature of the site and the fact that the school's enrolments are in decline, it was not proposed to provide a classroom extension. That is what my officials communicated to the school at the time and of which I would not have been aware. The school manager responded on 17 February indicating that the Department's proposals were discussed at a board of management meeting and were not considered to be satisfactory. The manager forwarded an alternative plan which would involve extension by building upwards. He also forwarded a copy of a report prepared by the INTO which identified a number of features which it regarded as sub-standard. The Department will now review the case to see how best the problems can be solved. The school manager was advised on 2 March 1999 that we would review the application.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy again for the opportunity to outline the current position.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming to the House at this witching hour.</P>
      <P>I would like to make the case for the waiving of the television licence when televisions are used for educational purposes in schools. I welcome the major initiatives the Minister has been taking in education, particularly in relation to primary school class sizes, remedial teachers, library books, funding, changes in local contributions and information technology.</P>
      <P>One of the issues raised at regional meetings organised by the INTO and among managers and parents is the high cost of maintaining and running schools. Issues such as the high cost of insurance, refuse collection, payments, telephone charges and fax machines which, in many cases, are new charges are raised. New technology will also involve new charges. I, therefore, make the case for at least waiving the television licence.</P>
      <P>I understand there are 3,381 primary schools, 440 secondary schools, 243 vocational schools and 80 schools in the community and comprehensive sectors. That is a total of 4,144 schools at first and second levels. These are the schools for which I wish to make a case. An Post informed me that schools and colleges are treated as ordinary addresses for the purposes of the wireless and telegraphy legislation. Accordingly, it does not distinguish between the different types of premises on its database. I make a case for the humble television, which is particularly useful for educational videos. In many cases, that is the only reason it is used in the school. There should be an exemption as the television is part of education technology. I strongly recommend that the television licence be waived in the case of schools.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation, there is no distinction made between television sets used as monitors for videos and those used to receive television programmes. Any provision to exempt schools from the requirement to purchase television licences would require a change in legislation, which would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The cost of purchasing television licences forms part of the normal running costs of schools. My Department's scheme of capitation grants is intended to defray the general running costs of primary schools which would include the cost of television licences, among other costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> However, my Department operates a scheme whereby schools which are in designated areas of disadvantage have the cost of their television licences refunded to them.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy of the Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in our policy document &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;. To this end, I obtained an increase of £5 in the standard rate of capitation grant payable at primary level in 1998 and a further £10 increase has been provided for in the 1999 Estimates, which will bring the standard capitation grant to £60 per pupil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> This constitutes a 33 per cent increase in the grant in place since I assumed office. These increases in the capitation grant represent important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level and in helping schools meet their day-to-day running costs.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the question of further increases in this grant will continue to receive priority over the coming years. I will undertake to have discussions with my Cabinet colleagues on the amendment to legislation which could give effect to the request the Deputy has made.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.05 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 March 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 to 32, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Those authorised in my office to have regular dealings with the media are the Government Press Secretary, the Deputy Government Press Secretary and Head of the Government Information Service, and the press officers in the GIS. From time to time some political and background briefing is done by my special advisers at my request. Inevitably, in the absence of the Government Press Secretary the same people may be drafted in as the occasion demands to brief the media on my behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Government Information Service and the Government Press Office are meeting the divisional goals as set out in my Department's strategy statement. The Govern<Col N="206" /> ment Information Service and the Government Press Office provide a comprehensive information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media on behalf of myself, my Department and the Government. Through regular contact with departmental press officers, the GIS ensures that there is a co-ordinated approach to media matters.</P>
    <P>The press secretary and his staff are in daily contact with news desks. Political correspondents are briefed on a daily basis by the press secretary and deputy press secretary, and foreign correspondents receive a weekly briefing. Press releases, statements and speeches are faxed simultaneously to news desks daily, and all important speeches and policy documents are posted on the GIS website. Staff of the GIS and departmental press officers are available after hours and at weekends to answer media queries.</P>
    <P>The press secretary and his staff strive to ensure that the business of implementing Government policy is communicated accurately, speedily and efficiently to the media.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1999, I have conducted nine pre-arranged interviews with the media, two for television, one for radio and six with different publications. I have also given numerous interviews to radio, television and print media while carrying out official functions in that period.</P>

    <P>On 5 June 1998 at my request, my Department forwarded to the chairman of the Flood tribunal a copy of a letter written under a false name and dated 29 May 1998, which I received on 3 June. On 22 June copies of correspondence from two other Departments arising from their initial <Col N="207" /> examinations of the matter referred to in the pseudonymous letter were forwarded to the chairman. On 14 July 1998 copies of letters dated June 1998, but received in July, addressed to the Attorney General and myself containing an anonymous allegation of impropriety in a planning matter were forwarded by my Department to the chairman of the Flood tribunal. That tribunal has sought no files from my Department.</P>
    <P>On 28 August 1998, my Department made available to the Moriarty tribunal copies of its records concerning a particular matter which the solicitor to the tribunal had sought by way of a confidential letter of 13 July 1998. </P>
    <P>Records in my Department's files relating to naturalisation for investment are replicated on Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform files which have been made available to the Moriarty tribunal. While no order of discovery has been made in respect of my Department's records, the Department has signalled to the tribunal the availability of its files if at any time the tribunal wishes to access them. Additionally, on 2 and 4 March 1999, my Department brought to the attention of the tribunal a number of records relating to naturalisation for investment which were among miscellaneous papers of special projects officers formerly assigned to my Department from the IDA and the CII. These records were delivered to the tribunal on 5 March 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department will of course continue to give any assistance it can to both tribunals.</P>

      <P>I launched the Government's strategy for the development of the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland on Monday, 1 March. Copies of the strategy have been laid before the Dáil. The IFSC is now established as a successful and reputable financial centre. More than 6,500 people are employed directly in the centre and in associated back-office projects. The creation of a vibrant financial services industry has also helped to reposition Ireland as a centre for knowledge-based industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IFSC is facing into a period of change. In particular, the corporation tax agreement with the European Commission will fundamentally change the nature of the IFSC as the preferential tax regime will no longer apply with the introduction of an across the board 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax. The introduction of the euro and advances in technology will also impact on the centre. In the light of these factors, it is necessary for the Government to articulate and implement a new vision for the development of the inter<Col N="208" /> national financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC. The strategy sets out this vision and an implementation plan based on 19 priorities. These priorities include: holding a seminar in June to launch this new vision; promoting the docklands as the hub for the longer-term development of the industry in Ireland &ndash; the location of back-office activity elsewhere will also be facilitated where necessary to maintain competitiveness; the docklands authority will implement a development strategy for accommodation and infrastructure for international financial services in the docklands area; IDA Ireland will implement a revised marketing plan for the promotion of the industry; measures will be taken in response to the education and training needs of IFSC companies; taxation issues affecting the industry will be addressed having regard to EU and domestic constraints; company law will be amended to improve the competitive position of the industry; measures are being introduced to eliminate the inappropriate use of IRNR companies; a pro-active approach to ensure Ireland is well-placed to capitalise on opportunities for electronic commerce in financial services and new development opportunities will be pursued, including in the areas of the European pensions market, securitisation and the marine services sector.</P>
    <P>The strategy was prepared through the IFSC clearing house group and working groups in my Department. These groups bring together industry representatives with the different Government Departments and agencies involved. While the implementation of individual commitments remains a matter for each responsible Department or agency, a public sector group will be convened and chaired by my Department to co-ordinate and monitor progress. The IFSC clearing house group will submit a progress report on implementation of the strategy to the Government at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four sections dealing with Government policy and direction, as set out in my Depart<Col N="209" /> ment's strategy statement, are the Northern Ireland division, the European and international affairs division, the economic and social policy division, and the Strategic Management Initiative division. There are seven staff in the Northern Ireland division, seven in the European and international affairs division, 19 in the economic and social policy division, and seven in the Strategic Management Initiative division. Overall, good progress has been made in achieving the goals set out in the strategy statement in each of these divisions.</P>
    <P>Taking into consideration what was set out in my Department's strategy statement relating to policy on Northern Ireland  &ndash; that there are external factors which influence the prospects of success in achieving our goals &ndash; I am satisfied we have secured a considerable amount of success. This is in no small way due to the tremendous dedication, commitment and input by the staff involved.</P>
    <P>The four goals of the European and international affairs division, as set out in the strategy statement, are continuous in their nature. At present the key focus of the division is Ireland's Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    <P>The economic and social policy division plays a pivotal role in the co-ordination of policy development in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other key Departments in order to achieve the Government's economic objectives, especially those set out in Partnership 2000. Good progress is being made in achieving these objectives.</P>
    <P>I believe significant achievements are being made in progressing the Strategic Management Initiative, SMI, in the Irish Civil Service and the wider public service and the SMI divisional goals set out in my Department's strategy statement are being achieved. The SMI is a wide-ranging programme for the modernisation of the Civil and Public Service and as set out in the report Delivering Better Government, published in May 1996, the key objective of which is the achievement of an excellent service for all clients and customers.</P>

      <P>Perhaps first of all, I should explain that the Director of Prison Medical Services is the official in my Department with responsibility for the delivery of medical service to the whole of the prison system and not just to Mountjoy Prison. It is not, and has never been, the policy of my Department to publish or release internal reports prepared by an official of the Department for the Minister in charge of the Department. Consequently, the reports of the Director of Prisons Medical Service have not been published to date.</P>
      <P>A Freedom of Information request was received on 14 August 1998 in my Department in relation to the 1997 Annual Report of the Director of Prison Medical Services. Both the deciding officer and the appeals officer decided that the request for access to the report in question should be refused under sections 20 and 21 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, as the report contained information relating to deliberative processes of my Department and details of sensitive industrial relations negotiations which were still ongoing. This decision was appealed last October to the Information Commissioner. Following consultation between my Department, the applicant and the Information Commissioner agreed recently to release the report in part and this is now available on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report was submitted to me by the Director of Prison Medical Services on 4 June 1998. It deals in a comprehensive manner with the wide range of medical and therapeutic facilities avail<Col N="211" /> able to prisoners within the prison system. It is an important report which focuses on the actual medical and therapeutic services provided, the quality of these services and the areas where improvements are required.

      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme is a two year programme which contains three funding initiatives, each of which has a separate budget with distinct criteria and targets. All three initiatives are inter-dependent and strive towards the common aim of improving the quality and quantity of child care provision in Ireland from an equal opportunities-disadvantaged perspective. The equal opportunities child care programme is administered by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, on behalf of my Department. ADM is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies established by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equal opportunities child care programme is funded by the EU and the Exchequer. A sum of £2.6 million was provided in my Department's Vote in 1998 for child care. Approximately £200,000 of this was Exchequer funding for the Expert Working Group on Child Care. Of the remaining £2.4 million, \500,000 &ndash; approximately £390,000 &ndash; was from the EU, while the balance was provided by the Exchequer, for the equal opportunities child care programme and for £50,000 matching funding for the IPPA in respect of an EU NOVA project and £50,000 for a Dublin Institute of Technology EU NOW project. The NOVA and NOW projects fed into the deliberations of the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Child Care. Administration of the programme costs £106,000 per annum and matching funding for the EU funded Child Care Database is £38,000 over the two year period. All of the 1998 provision was drawn by ADM in 1998. In 1999, a total of £3.6 million has been provided in my Department's Vote for child care. This comprises \1.5 million &ndash; approximately £1.18 million &ndash; from the EU with the balance being <Col N="212" /> provided by the Exchequer. Of this £3.6 million, £100,000 is being made available to the Shanty project in Tallaght, £50,000 for year two of the Dublin Institute of Technology EU NOW project, while the remainder will be provided to the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme on the basis of applications received in May-June 1998.</P>
    <P>Applications were invited in relation to the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme in the national newspapers and the closing date for receipt of applications for funding under this two year programme was May-June 1998. All funding is being allocated on the basis of applications received in advance of the May-June 1998 deadline. The bulk of this funding was allocated in July of last year and a further £450,000 fails to be allocated this year in respect of applicants which met the qualifying criteria under the capital infrastructure strand. The allocation of child care funding to my Department post 1999 has not yet been addressed.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report, A Strategy for Equality, recommended the establishment of a graduated payment to meet the additional everyday costs associated with disability. This payment was referred to as a costs of disability payment. The Commission recommended the establishment of this payment having identified what it described as several serious weaknesses in the provision of income support for people with disabilities. It contended that the level of allowances payable by the State do not make provision for the costs of disability, which can be very high for many people.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently chairing an interdepartmental task force which is drafting a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the commission's report. The issue of a costs of disability payment is being considered by the task force in the context of its overall consideration of the Commission's report. I await with interest the outcome of the task force's deliberations and it is my intention to submit the plan of action to Government as soon as possible after its completion. The administration of a payment such as that recommended by the commission would not be a matter for my Department but would, instead, fall under the responsibility of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>In case there is any confusion on this point, it is not the function of the Garda Síochána to carry out spot checks on social welfare recipients. The Garda have given the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and a number of other agencies the opportunity to be involved in the operation of multi-agency checkpoints. The purpose of the checkpoints is to monitor compliance with various enactments. Each agency exercises the option to participate, as its own operational needs require, and operates in accordance with the law relating to its own area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is taking the opportunity in the context of the Social Welfare Bill, 1999, to replace general powers of inspection with more specific powers appropriate to the ongoing operation of these checkpoints. Section 26 of the Bill makes specific provision for a social welfare inspector exercising his or her statutory powers, accompanied by a Garda in uniform, to stop any vehicle he or she reasonably suspects is being used for the purpose of employment or self-employment and to make inquiries of any persons in such a vehicle or require them to produce any record in their possession in connection with their employment or business.</P>
      <P>At present, multi-agency checkpoints are initiated by the Garda and, in the main, this will continue to be the case. Following the enactment of the Social Welfare Bill, there may be occasions when the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs wishes to initiate a vehicle checkpoint. However, it may only do so with the agreement of the Garda Síochána. There will be no obligation on a member of the Force to accompany a social welfare inspector and a social welfare inspector will not be entitled to stop a vehicle unless a Garda is present.</P>

      <P>I have already circulated heads of my proposals for amendment of intoxicating liquor laws to Departments for observations as a preliminary to submission of them to Government for approval for formal drafting. The proposals will be submitted to Government in the very near future and the decisions made by the Government on the details will be announced in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My scheme of proposals follow on extensive consultations and meetings with representative groups. The proposals take account of the June 1998 report on liquor licensing laws by the Sub-Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights and the September 1998 interim report of the Competition Authority. The proposals are also a response to the many submissions which have been received from groups and individuals, in response to the invitation, by way of advertisements placed by my Department in the national and local press in August 1998, for comments on our licensing laws. In excess of 70 written submissions were received. I can confirm that those submissions came from many representative <Col N="215" /> groups including the Vintners Federation of Ireland. The various submissions were wide-ranging and covered many of the issues raised in the Oireachtas Committee's report concerning hours of trading, licensing and under-age drinking.</P>

      <P>As I have previously told the House, the TRACE group consists of an assistant commissioner, one superintendent, one inspector, two detective sergeants and two detective Garda and is based at Naas Garda Station. The group has been set up to specifically re-examine a number of the original investigations of missing persons cases. They have begun this task by initially reviewing the cases of Annie McCarrick, Jo Jo Dollard, Fiona Pender, Ciara Breen, Fiona Sinnott and Deirdre Jacob. I am informed that other cases which may be relevant, are also being reviewed.</P>
      <P>The investigation files are being reviewed and collated by the unit, and a computer database has been established to facilitate the cross-referencing of items of relevance. None of the officers involved in this work are reviewing cases on which they have worked previously. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the operation by its very nature is methodical and painstaking but is progressing satisfactorily. I understand that the media interest generated by Operation TRACE, &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; and the television series &ldquo;Solved and Unsolved&rdquo; has resulted in new information being provided by the public.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to Parliamentary Question No. 3 on Thursday, 4 February which sets out the details in relation to the high number of suspicious approaches made to children which were reported to the Garda over the past few months. I am assured by the Garda authorities that all such reports are treated very seriously, and are fully investigated. I should at this stage, point out that the classification of such incidents depends on the outcome of each investigation, and the determination of whether a crime was committed at all in some of these cases or whether there was the intent to commit a crime. All reports, as I have said, are being taken seriously and being fully investigated by the Garda and I understand from the Garda Síochána that the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is co-ordinating all incidents of suspicious approaches made to children.</P>
      <P>In relation to the actual number of child abductions reported to the Garda in 1998 I am informed that the total number was three. I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that there was one reported abduction to date in 1999. In each of these cases the abduction resulted from a situation of conflict over custody of the children. I would also refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 346 of 16 February 1999 which gives details of the one attempted child abduction by a stranger which occurred in the State in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The therapeutic treatment available to sex offenders in prison is kept under review. As I have said on many occasions in the past, I am determined to increase the number of group treatment places and individual counselling available to sex offenders. There are at present 29 full-time professionals and two consultants involved in rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders in prisoners. Four of these are working on the dedicated sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison and the remainder are involved in one to one counselling.</P>
      <P>The sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill can cater for up to ten offenders at any one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies. Where more than ten offenders who have applied are considered suitable, the places on the next programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence. The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, I am determined to increase the number of group treatment places available to sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is examining the possibility of locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh Place of Detention. In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, it is taking some time to put a new programme in place. Of course any prisoner currently there may apply to participate in the dedicated treatment programme in Arbour Hill. A new non-therapeutic programme for offenders, The Thinking Skills Training Programme, was introduced in Arbour Hill Prison early in 1998. A significant number of sex offenders in Arbour Hill have commenced this new programme. A similar programme has also been introduced in Cork Prison.</P>
      <P>My Department has also commissioned the clinical psychology department at University College Dublin to conduct a detailed evaluation of the group treatment programme at Arbour Hill. This will take a number of years to complete and should eventually provide empirical data that demonstrates the efficacy of treatment, as measures by reduced recidivism amongst treated offenders compared to an untreated group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say, generally, about sex offending, that it is an issue of understandable public concern and one to which I believe a comprehensive <Col N="218" /> response is warranted. While I am certainly determined to expand the prison treatment programme, I believe that action will be required on other points also, which is why I had a paper published by my Department last May on sexual offending. That paper covered a number of issues which will have to be addressed as part of the comprehensive response I am pursuing. The various responses to the paper, which have been received from the public, have been considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>In early February I sought and obtained Cabinet approval to prepare a Bill providing for the establishment of a sex offenders register, the post-release supervision of sex offenders in the community and separate legal representation in certain circumstances for complainants in rape and serious sexual assault cases. In addition, I will be examining for possible inclusion in the Bill a new civil court order against a sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda reasonable cause for concern that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious hard, and the creation of a new offence for a convicted child sex offender to look for or to accept employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the crime statistics published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána are accurate reflections of the level and nature of crimes reported or known to the Garda in the year to which they refer. I am also satisfied that crime levels have decreased dramatically in recent years.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is useful to have another way of gauging crime levels and that is why my Department developed a crime and victimisation module for inclusion in the CSO's quarterly national household survey for the last quarter of 1998. The main topics covered included the incidence, type, location and other relevant aspects of crime in the past year; whether crimes were reported to the Garda, household security, and people's perceptions in relation to crime and safety.</P>
      <P>I understand the relevant information was collected in the three month period from September to November 1998 from a sample of 39,000 households. I am informed that the results should be available in the middle of this year, subject to satisfactory progress with processing and analysing the data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Statistics Act, 1993, the CSO has authority to co-ordinate statistics compiled by <Col N="219" /> some public bodies. In the justice area &ndash; courts, prisons and the Garda Síochána &ndash; it does not have that right and as such they compile the reports themselves. Apart from the quarterly national household survey, there is no need for the Central Statistics Office to become directly involved in the collection of crime statistics. We should not underestimate the scale of the operation involved in collecting crime statistics given that there are over 700 Garda stations in the country.</P>
    <P>While victimisation surveys are a useful complement to police statistics, the two sets of data are not directly comparable. Both types of information suffer from methodological difficulties &ndash; for instance, the everyday terms used by crime surveys differ from the legal terminology used by the Garda. I look forward with interest to the publication of the CSO crime survey, which will provide much useful information about crime in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are well aware of the need to have arrangements in place designed to prevent large sums of money failing into the hands of criminals. The security arrangements to be made in such instances are matters to be determined by the Garda authorities on the basis of their professional judgment, deploying to maximum effect the resources at their disposal.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, for obvious reasons, there are limits to the level of detail concerning such arrangements on which I can comment publicly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> The current security arrangements to protect cash-in-transit include a Garda monitoring plan which takes into account the movement of all cash-in-transit vehicles so as to afford the maximum coverage possible to each such movement and with a view to ensuring a swift and appropriate response in the event of an actual raid occurring. These arrangements, which are consistently followed, have been in place for some time and, while it would not be possible for the Garda authorities to guarantee that each and every attempted armed robbery can be successfully prevented, have generally proved to be effective nationwide.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that these cash escort policies are kept under constant review and, in line with standard practice, there is a further review of existing arrangements ongoing following the robbery on 4 January of a security van in Dalkey, County Dublin. The Dalkey raid is still under Garda investigation, and while a preliminary review has taken place, it will not be finalised until after the investigation is completed.</P>
    <P>The fact that lives were threatened by the criminals who carried out the robbery in Dalkey was a particular source of concern and underlined the importance for the Garda of taking on board any lessons to be learned from the incident in determining its future crime fighting strategies. The Garda Commissioner has established a working group, comprising senior Garda officers and representatives from financial institutions and security companies, to comprehensively review current cash escort arrangements, which is expected to report its findings shortly.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce some form of payment for parental leave in view of the amendment he introduced during the passage of the legislation which removed the words "without pay" from section 6 of the Parental Leave Act, 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the passage of the Parental Leave Act I introduced an amendment to delete the words &ldquo;without pay&rdquo; from section 6. I made it clear at the time that by deleting these words I was not imposing an obligation on employers to provide paid leave or making a commitment about any form of State benefit for persons on parental leave. The amendment was introduced in response to concerns that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;without pay&rdquo; might prevent an employer from paying for parental leave, if he or she so wished. I was conscious of the need to avoid compromising future negotiations under Partnership 2000 and of the concerns raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no plans to introduce a form of state payment for parental leave, there is a <Col N="222" /> requirement under section 28 of the Parental Leave Act for a review of its operation not earlier than two years and not later than three years after its commencement. Such a review will take place after consultation with representatives of employers and employees.</P>

      <Quest>the three most common reasons for road accidents; the measures, if any, put in place to reduce road accidents and, in particular, to respond to the National Roads Authority's annual report on road accident facts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Garda authorities are determined to continue to confront the unacceptable high levels of deaths and injuries on our roads. The provisional figure for 1998 shows that 461 persons were killed as a result of road traffic accidents. While this figure shows a decline on the 1997 figure of 473, it is still unacceptably high.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Government launched the national strategy on road safety &ndash; The Road To Safety &ndash; on 31 July 1998. Its principal aim is to reduce death and serious injuries on our roads by at least 20 per cent by 2002. This strategy is providing a framework plan encompassing legislative change, enforcement, new technology, multi-agency co-operation as well as a wider public ownership of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to implementation of the strategy, the following measures have been introduced or will be introduced during the current year: Operation Lifesaver to continue into 1999; a trial of a fixed camera on the M1, Dublin to Belfast has been completed by the Garda the results of which are being evaluated and the fines on-the-spot system has been extended with effect from 1 February 1999 by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to include the following offences: seat belt offences, traffic light infringements, stop-yield sign infringements, box junction infringements, defective tyres, breaches of centre line roadway and merging-diverging road markings, unauthorised driving in bus lanes. With regard to the commitment given in the national strategy to introduce evidential breath testing, I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the introduction of evidential <Col N="223" /> breath testing is continuing with a view to its introduction countrywide by the end of this year. The introduction this year of a penalty points system is being explored by all the agencies involved in road safety. The introduction of the relevant legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Garda authorities are concerned, they have taken the following measures in recent years: the Garda national traffic policy bureau, based at Garda headquarters under the direction of a chief superintendent, was established in July 1997 &ndash; the primary focus of the bureau is policy development, with particular emphasis on formulating proactive enforcement strategies aimed at reducing road deaths and serious injury accidents; the launch of Operation Lifesaver on 14 July 1997 and its subsequent extension nationwide in the autumn of 1997 and as a result of Operation Lifesaver, the Garda has identified the following offences as major factors in serious road accidents which have been singled out for particular attention by the Garda in its enforcement policies: excessive speed, drink driving, non-compliance with seat belt wearing, dangerous-careless driving.</P>
    <P>Operation Lifesaver involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks, in addition to extensive road safety publicity campaigns, using local and national media as well as schools campaigns which are designed to educate road users on the need to take care on the roads. This campaign will continue to the year 2002.</P>
    <P>The Garda will continue to issue on the spot speeding tickets, which were extended to speeding offences in December 1996. Since then 191,834 notices have been issued for such offences. Approximately 75 per cent of these were paid without a court appearance by the defendants.</P>
    <P>In line with the increase in Garda enforcement activity, I have funded and will continue to fund additional resources in terms of manpower and equipment identified by the Garda for the effective enforcement of traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>The Garda has five GATSO units, a mobile speed detection unit with on board computer and camera facilities. In addition to the planned introduction of fixed cameras in the Louth-Meath division on a pilot basis the Garda also possesses a wide range of other speed detection equipment such as tripod mounted lasers, in-car video systems and hand-held radar guns.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the continuing Garda enforcement campaign combined with the full implementation of the national strategy can contribute during the lifetime of the national strategy, that is, 1998 to 2002, to the reduction in the number of road accidents and fatalities. It must also be stated unequivocally that a change in the mindset of drivers and other road users to one of compliance with the law is necessary to effect long-term reductions in road traffic accidents.</P>

      <P>C wing in Limerick Prison where the female prisoners are housed is an old building. The ground floor comprises a reception area, visiting room, servery area and domestic science-craft room with an exercise yard. On the second floor, there is a surgery, a staff room, an education room, gymnasium, shower and toilet area. Four cells are also located on this floor. The recreation-television room, games-pool room, laundry facilities and six cells are located on the third floor.</P>
      <P>A range of medical, dental, optical, psychiatric, probation and welfare services are available to prisoners as required. It is policy to have single cell occupancy in the women's prison. However, increased numbers necessitate doubling up from time to time. Occasionally prisoners request doubling up, especially if they are in prison for the first time.</P>
      <P>Education is provided in two rooms &ndash; a domestic science room and a general purpose room which contains computer equipment. Classes are provided subject to the demands of the prisoners and the courses pursued include computers, art, philosophy, drama, basic cookery, assertiveness courses, English to junior and leaving certificate level and crafts.</P>
      <P>There is a room with a television and video and a sub-library. Prisoners can order particular reading material from the main prison library or from Limerick city library.</P>
      <P>I accept that the present accommodation is not adequate and plans to provide replacement accommodation are at an advanced stage. The new facility will have the following features: single cell accommodation with attention to prisoners safety features; integral sanitation in all cells; medical surgery; visiting facilities; shower facilities; a full range of education, work training and physical education facilities; indoor and outdoor recreation; the new accommodation will meet current statutory regulations in respect of hygiene, health and safety, including fire safety.</P>
      <P>This new facility is envisaged as a short to medium term solution for accommodating females at Limerick Prison, pending the development of plans for a new purpose built unit on the prison site to be constructed when financial resources permit.</P>

      <P>There are 6,855 applications for asylum in hand in my Department.</P>
      <P>The majority of applicants have no documentary evidence of identity. The documents in the possession of some applicants have been provided by a facilitator for the purpose of travel and, accordingly, are not reliable. It is an important feature of the asylum determination process for an asylum seeker to show that he or she has grounds for being recognised as a refugee and that the asylum seeker is who he or she claims to be. It is necessary, therefore, for asylum seekers to produce, as far as it is possible in their particular circumstances, some sort of evidence as to their identity.</P>
      <P>It is common practice to advise all asylum seekers to try to secure and provide documentary evidence of their nationality and documentary evidence to support their application for asylum.</P>
      <P>The authorities in the country of application are precluded from making any inquiries with the country of origin as to the identity of any individual seeking asylum. Officials of my Department are fully compliant with this requirement. Any research of country of origin information is from independent sources, which primarily includes the UNHCR.</P>

      <P>The average weekly cost of keeping an offender in custody is £987. A breakdown between institutions is not yet available. This figure is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders over a certain period, in this case 1998. These running costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the level of prisoners in custody, that is mainly officers' wages but also such items as lighting and heating. It cannot be assumed that each increase by one in the prison population will result in increased expenditure of £987 per week. Taking the fixed costs into account, the additional expenditure would be more in the region of £340. Neither, due to economies of scale, would there be a direct <i>pro rata</i> relationship with changes in the number of prisoners in other areas of expenditure such as overtime, education, work and training. The only area which would see such a relationship is the prisoners' gratuities subhead, expenditure on which is linked directly to the number of sentenced prisoners in custody.</P>

      <P>I have received a request for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings from a committee of victims and relatives of those killed or injured. The Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 which resulted in the deaths of 33 people and injuries to hundreds were the subject of an intensive Garda investigation over a protracted period of time. Unfortunately, despite intensive inquiries, the Garda has not obtained sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution being taken against any persons for these atrocities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one cannot have anything but sympathy for those affected, I am unconvinced that the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry along the lines sought by the committee would be the right course of action to take. It is important not to overlook the fact that the Garda investigation file on these bombings remains open. The objective <Col N="227" /> of any Garda investigation is to secure evidence which would be sufficient to bring before the courts those believed to be responsible. That is not something which can be achieved by a tribunal of inquiry. While evidence has not been obtained to date on which a prosecution could be based, if new information should emerge which might bring the culprits to justice, it will be rigorously pursued by the Garda.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment, I have been anxious to do anything I can to address the needs of all those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland. I obtained Government approval last May for the establishment of the Victims Commission headed by former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, who was asked to identify what further measures need to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of these persons and, in particular, the needs and concerns of victims and the families of victims of violence connected to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I understand Mr. Wilson has consulted with the victims and relatives of victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings on a number of occasions in the course of his work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Fahey, undertook a fundamental examination of the Children Bill, 1996, which deals primarily with juvenile justice matters on being given responsibility for it in February 1998. That examination included an appraisal of juvenile justice systems in other countries and of developments and advances in the juvenile justice area since the Bill was originally published.</P>
      <P>The examination of the Bill has entailed extensive discussions with the other Departments and bodies which will be most affected by many of the changes being considered. Work on the amendments which will reflect the outcome of the examination is now almost complete. Given the large number of changes, consideration will have to be given as to whether it will be possible to progress the Bill by way of introducing a very large number of amendments or whether it will be necessary to introduce a new Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Garda Síochána participate fully in the various working groups in place within the European Union, at which a complete range of policing and law enforcement issues are discussed. In addition, they have informed me that they are aware of other discussions taking place within the EU, that fall primarily within the areas of responsibility of my Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting of the Pompidou Group held in Strasbourg in October 1998, which was attended by representatives of my Department and of the Department of Health and Children, the non-sports use of drugs was discussed. At that meeting it was generally agreed that there is a need for <Col N="230" /> regulation, police and customs co-operation and harm reduction and the meeting was informed that the Council of Europe was considering setting up a specific structure or group to deal with this particular issue.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, has informed me that an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Europe Monitoring Group of the Anti-Doping Convention, on 5 November 1998 agreed a number of priority issues for action by the monitoring group or at national level including a review of national laws dealing with anti-doping measures and the promotion of closer co-operation between police, customs and other relevant authorities with a view to reducing the supply of doping agents to sport.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has also informed me of an EU Non Paper which was presented to an informal Council of Sports Ministers in Bonn in January of this year, which calls for greater co-ordination and information exchange programmes within the framework of police and judicial co-operation to prevent further growth in criminal activity in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question regarding the production of these substances, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, under whose authority the Misuse of Drugs Act falls, has informed me that his Department has doubts regarding the significance of the involvement of clandestine laboratories in the manufacture of banned substances for use in doping in sport as the vast majority of such substances are available as legitimate medicinal products in many countries throughout Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, as a matter of course, engage in extensive operational co-operation with law enforcement agencies within the European Union and beyond in relation to matters of mutual concern. This is in addition to Irish representation at the appropriate fora dealing with this question.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there is no evidence or intelligence known to the Garda Síochána to substantiate the suggestions in this question, as far as this jurisdiction is concerned. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that any cases involving breaches of the Misuse of Drugs Act will be thoroughly investigated by the Garda.</P>

      <P>In December 1995 the probation and welfare service of my Department ceased to operate a service to the District Court <Col N="231" /> (Family Law). The service did not have the resources to enable it to undertake the duties as set out in the Family Law Act, 1995, which gave jurisdiction to the Circuit Court to hear the majority of family law cases, as well as some cases being heard in the District Court.</P>
      <P>The expert group which I established in November 1997 to examine the probation and welfare service advised in their first report which was published in November 1998 that they would be examining the role of the service in family law and I am awaiting the group's second report which I hope to receive in mid 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 77 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>I previously indicated to the House that I intended to make regulations to provide for the introduction of a national voluntary age card scheme as provided for in section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. I am glad to be able to say that those Regulations were made by me on 19 January 1999, and they will come into effect on 19 April 1999.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1988 provides only for the introduction of a voluntary age card scheme and I have no plans to amend the law in this regard to provide for a mandatory scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other provisions in the 1988 Act of importance in relation to under-age drinking. It is an offence to sell intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of 18 years and it is an offence for such persons to purchase or consume intoxicating liquor in certain circumstances. There are restrictions on persons under the age of 18 years being <Col N="232" /> on licensed premises. The Garda Síochána are given powers under the Act to demand names and addresses, seize intoxicating liquor, arrest without warrant and enter and inspect premises. I am informed that the gardaí are enforcing the legislation on underage drinking on a daily basis countrywide and are adequately resourced in this area.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that, arising from my review of the licensing laws generally, I propose in the near future to seek the approval of the Government for additional legislative measures to strengthen the fight against under-age drinking. I can also say that the draft heads of my proposals in this and other areas of intoxicating liquor law are already with Departments for observations prior to their being submitted to Government. The decisions made by the Government will be announced in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer demonstration initiative is one of the three elements of the equal opportunities child care programme, for which my Department has responsibility. The employer demonstration initiative, which is being led by IBEC, involves 21 companies, some forming a consortium with other companies and community projects in their locality, in developing child care facilities for their employees. The total budget available for the employer demonstration initiative over the two year period 1998-99 is £1 million from the EU, the Exchequer and employer sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January of this year I attended a project network meeting which was arranged by Area <Col N="233" /> Development Management Ltd. and IBEC, and was attended by all of the companies involved in this initiative. The main purpose of this meeting was to exchange information on projects and to learn from projects that are at a more advanced stage than others.</P>
    <P>When they are in operation, the child care facilities that will be provided by these employers will be of economic benefit to businesses as well as being of benefit to employees. The problems being created by the shortage of skilled employees in the current economic climate are very real. Projected figures show that the total labour force is expected to grow to 1.9 million by 2011 with a continued increase in female participation. A substantial number of child care places, therefore, will be required. It is hoped that the benefits which the employers that are involved in this initiative will enjoy will be replicated by other employers in the future. The availability of suitable child care facilities also makes an important contribution to the family as a whole, when both parents are working, and assists in the reconciliation of work and family life.</P>
    <P>My Department is chairing an interdepartmental committee the terms of reference of which are to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report of the expert working group on child care, the child care proposals in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the National Forum for Early Childhood Education and to make recommendations to Government within six months.</P>
    <P>The budget also included measures to facilitate and encourage the supply of child care facilities by employers. The provision of certain child care facilities by employers on a free or subsidised basis will no longer be subject to income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind. Capital allowances have been provided to allow for the write-off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1997, the latest year for which statistics are readily available, 15,075 referrals were made to the National Juvenile Office which represents an increase of 5.5 per cent &ndash; 790 referrals &ndash; on the previous year. It would be unsafe to assume, however, that an increase in the number of referrals is matched by a corresponding increase in the amount of crime committed by juveniles.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that there was an increase in the overall detection rate for indictable crime in 1997 and it is not surprising against that background that there would be an increase in the number of referrals to the juvenile diversion scheme. This is not to suggest that there are grounds for complacency in regard to the incidence of juvenile crime but simply that statistics for referrals need to be treated with caution as indicators of the changing level of juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>The increase in detections may be attributed to the Government policy of greater enforcement of legislation such as that relating to public order offences and alcohol related offences. If one looks at the offence of intoxication in public, for example, the number of referrals in 1997 increased by 491 from the previous year. It must also be remembered that greater enforcement of this type of legislation will show a greater detection rate in relation to young people compared to adults as offences such as public order and drink related offences are primarily committed by young people and in some cases can only be committed by young people &ndash; underage drinking, for example.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to brief the House on other initiatives in the area of juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, announced on 22 July last year that the Government had decided to establish an expert working group to inquire into the increasing number of children coming before the children's court.</P>
      <P>The group is examining: intervention and prevention strategies as a means of keeping children out of the courts; why there appears to be an increase in the numbers of children coming before the courts; the behavioural patterns of children coming before the courts in the lead up to a court appearance; the present non-custodial options open to the courts when dealing with children; best practice models in existence in this country and in a number of other countries where community sanctions are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group also commissioned research into the numbers and profile of juveniles appearing before the Children's Court. The Children Bill, 1996, which deals primarily with juvenile justice <Col N="237" /> matters has been thoroughly re-examined and work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of amendments which will reflect the outcome of that re-examination. Because of the large number of amendments, consideration will have to be given as to whether it will be possible to progress the Bill by way of introducing a very large number of amendments or whether it will be necessary to introduce a new Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong, of course, to view the Children Bill in isolation from crime preventive measures provided for in the Child Care Act, 1991, and in the Department of Education and Science's schemes and plans for legislation aimed at tackling the problem of truancy.</P>
    <P>My Department has also expanded the number of community-based youth diversion projects from 14 to 24. The projects are located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dundalk, Bray, Tralee and Sligo. They are targeted at specific large, high density urban areas where there is a combination of a large young population, high unemployment and a lack of basic amenities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the probation and welfare service of my Department is involved in, and runs, a number of community-based projects which cater for young offenders at risk of continuing in crime. These projects include workshops and day centres where offenders are provided with training in a number of skills. The purpose is to address offending behaviour, reduce recidivism and to assist such persons in gaining employment. A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision. This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision. Participants on supervision orders from the courts may be referred to this scheme in place of a substantial custodial sentence, two years or more.</P>
    <P>I have also recently made arrangements to introduce a voluntary, national age card scheme which will greatly strengthen the existing measures aimed at curbing the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age. When the regulations come into operation any person who has attained 18 years of age will be entitled to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station. The introduction of a national age card will make a significant contribution to the continuing fight against underage drinking.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that projects directed at young people at risk, which come under the aegis of agencies for which I have responsibility, are but a part of the Government's overall programme to tackle social exclusion and drugs. The Taoiseach announced in January last year that the Government has decided on a programme for young people at risk. The centrepiece of the programme is a young people's facilities and services fund of £30 million to be provided over the next three years to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas. At least £20 million will be targeted at those areas <Col N="238" /> particularly affected by the heroin problem. The new fund is in addition to the £10 million provided in the current year to implement the plans of the local drugs task forces, and the £13 million provided for youth services. The allocations from the fund will be made by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>My Department funds a number of Garda special projects which are targeted at specific large, high density urban areas where there is a combination of a large young population, high unemployment and a lack of basic amenities. These community based, multi-agency projects have a very particular focus being directed at young people who are either involved in, or seen to be at risk of getting involved in, crime. The projects are also used to target juveniles who are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely, or are in need of emotional and developmental support due to family circumstances. My Department is currently funding 24 such projects at an annual cost of approximately £50,000 each. A formal evaluation of these projects is currently being undertaken by the Children's Research Unit, Trinity College.</P>
      <P>The projects are based in the following areas: Ronanstown, Tallaght, Moyross, Limerick, Knocknaheeney, Cork, Blanchardstown, Cherry Orchard, Ballybeg, Waterford, Mahon, Cork, Southill, Limerick, Darndale, Dundalk, Dublin North Inner city, The Glen, Cork, Finglas South, Donore Avenue, Hardwicke St, Kilcohan, Waterford, Bray, Loughlinstown/Ballybrack, O'Devaney Gardens, Phoenix Park area, Ballymun, Tralee, Sligo and Lower Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>In addition, the probation and welfare service of my Department is involved in, and runs, a number of community-based projects which cater for young offenders at risk of continuing in crime. These projects include workshops and day centres where offenders are provided with training in a number of skills. The purpose is to address offending behaviour, reduce recidivism and to assist such persons in gaining employment. A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision. This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision. Participants on supervision orders from the courts may be referred to this scheme in place of a substantial custodial sentence, two years or more. An extra sum of £1 million has been allocated to the probation and welfare service in the 1999 budget for special juvenile projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme is an extra-statutory scheme to divert juveniles away from the judicial system, where possible. It provides for the cautioning and supervision of young offenders, aged 18 years or under, as an alternative to prosecution. Under the scheme an attempt <Col N="241" /> is made to see why the juvenile in question has offended and where a problem is identified the juvenile liaison officer refers the family to the appropriate statutory or voluntary agency with expertise in the matter. The juvenile liaison officer deals with the offender as an individual, a member of a family and a member of the community. Even where the actions of a child do not amount to a criminal offence parents/guardians regularly seek support and guidance from the Garda Síochána who will activate the scheme for the benefit of such children. There are currently in excess of 90 Garda personnel of various ranks directly involved in the operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the schools programme run by the Garda Síochána community relations section is an ongoing active programme throughout the country. The objective of this programme is to make young people aware of the dangers of involving themselves in crime generally and to promote a greater safety awareness among young people. The operation and implementation of the programme is part of Garda policy. Garda community relations section monitors its implementation, and more than 3,000 Garda personnel have been trained in the programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that certain protections concerning security of tenure already exist within the landlord and tenant code and these protections are consistent with the need to balance the rights of individual parties under the Constitution. However, I can confirm that my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which also has relevant responsibilities, continue to keep the law under review to see what further measures can be taken in this area.</P>
      <P>In this context, I draw the Deputy's attention to that part of the Government's announcement of 9 March 1999 concerning a range of further initiatives in relation to the housing market which indicates that a decision in principle has been taken to establish a Commission to examine issues relating to security of tenure in the private rented sector.</P>

The Legal Aid Board is in the process of establishing a panel of private practitioners who will provide such a service in compliance with the board's terms and conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the absolute policy of my Department to take all reasonable measures that may be required to prevent drugs getting into prisons. The Department recognises, however, that in line with worldwide experience despite best endeavours and applying best operational practice some contraband may, from time to time, be brought inside. It may not be possible within any set of arrangements that can be defended on human rights grounds, to detect all attempts to get contraband through prison controls. The level of contraband getting into the prisons must be kept to the absolute minimum and even this level of contraband can present serious difficulties for the prisons administration and prisoners alike, not least in the area of health care. That being the case, it is clearly incumbent on my Department, to have in place an action plan which draws on the best medical advice available in this area and which addresses the health care and other issues that are associated with the misuse of drugs in prisons. It is important to emphasise again that the existence of the action plan does not in any way signal any tolerance and acceptance of the presence or misuse of drugs in prisons, nor does it signal any dilution in the basic policy of prevention. It represents a measured and responsible response to the reality that contraband sometimes gets through and nothing more than that.</P>
      <P>The abuse of drugs within the prison system is confined largely to the committal institutions in the Dublin area. The problem is most acute in Mountjoy Prison which, as the State's main committal prison, has a large daily throughput of prisoners, many of whom have long histories of drug abuse which they try to maintain while in custody. Most of the other institutions are relatively drug free.</P>
      <P>I am committed to tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way and to this end I have recently approved a new draft action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system of the kind which I mentioned earlier in this reply. The draft action plan builds on the agreed medical policy between my Department and the Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action plan involves a twin approach of supply control and demand reduction. A number of measures have been introduced to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include video surveillance, improved control of visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing of prisoners. Efforts to eliminate the supply of <Col N="244" /> drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own. It is the policy of my Department to continue its efforts to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusing and drug addicted offenders in the prisons.</P>

I am happy to inform the Deputy that this has been implemented.

Part of that committee's work programme for 1999 included anti-racism training for certain civil servants dealing with minority groups. The committee has informed me that, at present, it is delivering anti-racism training to 60 training officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs involved in the training of <Col N="245" /> frontline staff members of that Department in its various offices throughout the country. In addition, the consultative committee is developing a set of guidelines for training officers in other Departments, including my Department, and outside training agencies which are considering undertaking anti-racism training.

      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme was among the issues addressed by the Expert Working Group on Child Care which was chaired by my Department and which launched a report on 3 February 1999. The expert working group recommended that &ldquo;the Programme should be expanded so that the supply of quality child care in disadvantaged areas can continue to be physically upgraded and have enhanced staffing support and that an additional £3.5 million budget should be allocated to the Programme for each of the first three years of the (recommended) National Child Care Strategy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my responsibility in relation to the matters raised in her question relate to those areas of the law for which my Department has responsibility.</P>
      <P>The general approach taken in my Department to the question of consolidating and updating old statutes is to advance this to the greatest extent possible as various areas of the law are addressed with a view to producing substantive proposals for law reform. A good example of this approach is the Criminal Law Act, 1997, which, among other things, repealed 21 Acts going back as far as 1695. Similarly, measures such as the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, to a great extent updated and consolidated the law in the area with which it dealt.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the consolidation of legislation I might say that the Government has accepted the recommendations made in the report of the Review Group on the Law Offices of the State published in June 1997, which included the establishment of a statute law revision and consolidation unit within the Office of the Attorney General. I understand that a director of the statute law revision and consolidation unit has recently been appointed and will be consulting Departments with a view to drawing up a programme of statute law revision and consolidation. My Department looks forward to co-operating fully with the director in his endeavours in this regard.</P>

      <P>According to these reports the ayatollah had recently publicly challenged the Iraqi regime's continuing imprisonment of Shia clergy. His demand that they be released apparently attracted considerable public support. There have also been reports that there were demonstrations during his funeral which were met by severe restrictions by the Iraqi security forces, reportedly resulting in still further deaths.</P>
      <P>This is not the first murder of a Shia clergyman in such circumstances. In the past twelve months two other prominent ayatollahs were killed in the same area and there have been attacks on two others.</P>

    <P>The Government utterly condemns such gross violations of human rights. Such acts reflect the broad policy taken by the Iraqi regime towards dissidents.

      <P>At 08.46 hours on Monday 1 March 1999, a Lockheed 188 cargo aircraft made an approach to landing in poor visibility on runway 24 at Shannon Airport. There were three aircrew and three staff members on board. At the point of touchdown three of the four aircraft propellers struck the runway momentarily and the aircrew applied full power instantly to all four engines to overshoot the runway and go around for a second landing attempt.</P>
      <P>During this overshoot the propeller, and part of No. 3 engine, dropped from the aircraft and fell onto a grassy area 200 metres north west of the runway, within the confines of Shannon Airport. The aircrew brought the damaged aircraft around again with the assistance of the Shannon radar and landed safely on runway 24 without further incident. The runway was then closed while an inspection was carried out and any debris from the aircraft was removed by Shannon Airport personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were no injuries to persons in the aircraft and no injuries to persons or property in the area where the propeller fell. Officials from this Department's air accident investigation unit arrived on the scene thereafter to carry out a for<Col N="252" /> mal investigation into the accident. They will issue a report in due course.</P>
    <P>This was a serious accident and I share the concern expressed by the Deputy and the residents of the area. I commend the prompt response of the Shannon radar operator and fire services in ensuring a potential crash was avoided in this instance. The crew displayed considerable skill in safely landing the damaged aircraft from the second approach.</P>

      <P>The 1999 fodder scheme consists of a general fodder scheme and a special hardship fund. The general scheme will apply in all Disadvantaged areas and cover farmers with suckler cows, lowland ewes and milk quotas under 35,000 gallons. Payment rates will be the same as in the 1998 scheme subject to the same ceiling of £300 per beneficiary. Farmers who have already qualified for payment in December 1998 will receive a 50 per cent top-up on their payment. Payment will be made automatically to those qualifying.</P>
      <P>The special fodder hardship fund, for which the closing date for receipt of applications was 5 March 1999, operates on a countrywide basis. It was open to cattle farmers, including dry stock cattle farmers, who had not qualified for the 1998 scheme or the general fodder scheme for 1999. The aim of the scheme is to provide support to cattle farmers who are almost totally dependent on a small farm enterprise as a source of income. The maximum payment per applicant is £450 for farms located in the district electoral divisions designated for the December 1998 scheme and £300 in all other areas.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to alter the conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates, published by my Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, sets down guidelines for the application of organic fertilisers. It is recommended that land spreading of slurry should be carried out as early as practicable in the growing season so as to maximise uptake of nutrients by crops and minimise pollution risks. Each year at least half the slurry produced during the winter housing period should be landspread by 1 July and the remainder by 30 September. As a general practice slurry applications to land should be avoided during the non-growing season which varies throughout the country depending on local climatic conditions between the months of October and February.</P>
      <P>Participants in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme must comply with the agri-environmental specifications which include the following requirements. Manures or fertilisers are not to be applied where heavy rain is forecast in the ensuing 48 hours. Applications of slurry are to be applied at times which coincide with the growth pattern of different crops and spreading is to be avoided on wet or waterlogged soils, frozen or snow covered soils, land sloping steeply towards water courses, exposed bedrock or bare ground. Contamination of surface water or wells is to be avoided by leaving a buffer strip between these resources and the application area. This strip shall extend to 10 metres in the case of smaller water courses, 20 metres in the case of lakes and main channels, 50 metres in the case of domestic wells and up to 300 metres in the case of a public water supply. Slurry shall not be spread within 50 metres of any private dwelling, school, public building or amenity area.</P>

      <P>The new agri-environmental specifications set out the conditions under which grazing <Col N="257" /> rights are eligible for inclusion in the rural environment protection scheme. The specification is currently with the printers and will be available in the near future.</P>
      <P>The general conditions of the new specification provide: grazing rights are eligible for inclusion in REPS where documentary evidence of entitlement to such rights is provided, viz: rights registered on Land Registry folio; Land Commission Vesting Order; certified copy relevant estate papers from Land Commission records; grant by the freehold legal owner; grazing trust deed; grant of deed by original estate landlord; and other such acceptable documentary evidence of entitlement to such rights as may satisfy the Minister.</P>
      <P>The following must also be provided: details as submitted with area aid application and a sworn affidavit setting out the hectarage of grazing rights entitlement together with a signed map, to include a list of names of the other rights holders, outlining the boundaries of same.</P>
      <P>Additional to the general conditions where the grazing rights are on commonage land the following is the position: farmers or successors in title who own commonage shares and-or grazing rights who declared the commonage and-or grazing rights for area aid in 1997 or 1998 and either applied for livestock premia-headage in 1997 or 1998 are eligible for payment under Supplementary Measure A (Conservation of Natural Heritage). Those with less than 15 livestock units who have not made an area aid application and who provide evidence acceptable to the Minister that in 1997 or 1998 they farmed the commonage and-or grazing rights and either held quota rights or applied for livestock premia-headage are also eligible.</P>

Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) served an Order for Production on me, as Minister for Finance, on 16 December 1997, relating to documents pertaining to the operation of exchange controls in the years 1954 to 1993, inclusive. This Production Order also covered the Central Bank and in so far as it did so the Central Bank dealt directly with the tribunal. The Central Bank was delegated responsibility for the day to day operation of exchange controls with effect from 3 May 1965. Listings of files covered by the Order for Production have been forwarded from my Department to the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs. Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry).</P>

      <P>Section 352 of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides,<i> inter alia</i>, for tax relief in respect of capital expenditure (exclusive of site costs) incurred on the construction of hotels under the designated seaside resort scheme. In the case of owner occupiers, relief can be claimed in respect of 75 per cent or 50 per cent of total qualifying expenditure in year one. The remaining expenditure can be claimed at 5 per cent per annum up to a maximum of 100 per cent. Lessors of such a hotel are entitled to relief in respect of 50 per cent of qualifying expenditure in year one and the remaining expenditure can be claimed at 5 per cent per annum up to a maximum of 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Relief is due exclusively in respect of expenditure incurred during the qualifying period of the scheme, which is due to end on 30 June 1999. However, section 39 of the 1999 Finance Bill as published, provides for a further extension of the qualifying period of the scheme until 31 December 1999, where the relevant local authority certifies that 50 per cent of the project cost is incurred by 30 June 1999.</P>

      <P>The Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates, July 1996, contains wide-ranging advice and recommendations in relation to farm management practices, including the spreading of slurry. It recommends that the landspreading of slurry should be carried out as early as practicable in the growing season to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and minimise pollution risks. As a general practice, it also recommends that applications to land should be avoided during the non-growing season which varies throughout the country, depending on local climatic conditions, between the months of October and February. These recommendations are qualified by additional advice relating to weather and ground conditions which impact on suitability for slurry spreading.</P>
      <P>The code was jointly produced by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food on foot of obligations arising under Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. The advice and recommendations in the code have been promoted extensively by local authorities, the farm advisory services of the Department of Agriculture and Food, and Teagasc.</P>

The APS has an overall target of reducing the numbers of &ldquo;consistently poor&rdquo; from 9 per cent &ndash; 15 per cent of the population, as identified in <Col N="267" /> the 1994 LIIS, to less than 5 per cent &ndash; 10 per cent by 2007. The &ldquo;consistently poor&rdquo; are defined as those living in households whose incomes are below 50 per cent and 60 per cent of average net household income and are experiencing basic deprivation.</P>
    <P>While the numbers in consistent poverty fell between 1987 and 1994, the 1994 LIIS also showed that, compared with 1987, the proportion of persons below the 50 per cent and 60 per cent relative income lines had increased slightly, though the percentage below the 40 per cent relative income line fell or was stable.</P>
    <P>Distribution-sensitive summary poverty measures, which take into account not only numbers below the relative income lines but how far their incomes are below the line, fell between 1987 and 1994. This indicates that, although more people fell below the relative income lines, the depth of poverty was generally less severe.</P>
    <P>According to the ESRI data, households headed by an unemployed person and households headed by someone working in the home were the largest groups in poverty in 1994. The groups at greatest risk of poverty were: the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed; children, particularly those living in large families; single adult households and households headed by someone working in the home; lone parents; and people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Further analysis of the 1994 data carried out by the ESRI and sponsored by my Department and the Combat Poverty Agency resulted in the 1998 publication, <i>Where are Poor Households?</i> This study showed that poverty is not, to any significant degree, concentrated in any particular type of area and that housing tenure is a more significant factor in explaining the distribution of poverty risks and the concentration of poverty than location<i> per se.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Economic and Social Research Institute will finalise a report around Easter, commissioned by my Department and the Combat Poverty Agency, on poverty trends between the years 1994 and 1997, updating the data we have available. This, along with other relevant reports and research, will inform the future direction of the strategy and provide us with the updated information necessary to refocus our efforts on those most in need.</P>
    <P>I will, in the near future, be publishing an assessment of how we are doing in relation to the specific targets set out in the NAPS on the basis of this ESRI and other research.</P>

      <P>The death grant was introduced in October 1970 to help families meet the costs of funeral expenses.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to inform the Deputy that I have recently announced changes in the death grant, which is being redesigned and upgraded in the following way: increasing the amount payable five-fold from £100 to £500; improving the coverage by easing the qualifying conditions and extending the scheme to other PRSI contributors. Eligibility can be based on the insurance record of the deceased person or his or her spouse; and renaming the scheme to bereavement grant.</P>
      <P>Also, the Government has since agreed to backdate these changes from the original planned start-up date of 7 April 1999 to 2 February 1999.</P>
      <P>These improvements, at an estimated cost of £10 million in a full year, are the first step in the development of a new and improved bereavement allowance. Other schemes, including the six week payments after death arrangements will be reviewed further during 1999.</P>
      <P>Bereavement grant can actually be paid to the husband, wife, personal representative or next-of-kin, including the brother or sister, of the deceased person. It is paid to the person responsible for payment of the funeral bill.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, to provide PRSI related benefits to former public service workers, including civil servants based on their PRSI contribution system; and the entitlements, if any, retired civil servants have through the social welfare code of benefits based on their PRSI contributions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay related social insurance contributions are made by employers, employees and the self-employed. The rate of PRSI contribution depends on the class of social insurance applicable which, in turn, determines the range of benefits and pensions to which contributors may, in due course, become entitled.</P>
      <P>The majority of PRSI contributors are in the industrial, commercial and services sectors. Employees in these sectors are covered by class A social insurance and the combined employer and employee rate of PRSI is either 13 per cent or 16.5 per cent depending on the level of weekly income. Employees who pay Class A contributions are covered for all social insurance benefits and pensions, subject, of course, to meeting the contribution conditions for the individual schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employees recruited to the Civil and Public Service subsequent to 5 April 1995 pay PRSI at class A and are therefore covered for the full <Col N="269" /> range of social insurance benefits.  Permanent and pensionable civil servants and public servants, recruited prior to April 1995, pay PRSI at classes B and D, respectively. These contributors are covered for widow's and widower's contributory pensions, some occupational injuries benefits and orphan's contributory allowance. The range of cover provided is reflected in the combined rate of employer and employee contribution payable which is 3.25 per cent in the case of class D and 2.91 per cent in the case of class B.</P>
    <P>The Department also provides a number of free schemes which are available to retired and other persons under certain conditions. Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 or over and also to certain people with disabilities under that age. Free electricity allowance, free television licence, free natural or bottled gas and free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged over 66, getting a welfare type payment, subject to certain conditions, for example, living alone. The free schemes are also available to all low income pensioners, including retired civil and public servants, who satisfy a means test.</P>
    <P>Thus, retired civil and public servants, aged over 66, who are in receipt of a widow's or widower's contributory pension will, subject to the usual conditions, qualify for the free schemes. Alternatively, a person, aged over 66, who is not in receipt of a qualifying payment and whose means do not exceed a certain level will also qualify for the relevant free schemes.</P>
    <P>Any extension of social insurance cover under classes B and D would require an increase in the contribution rates payable by both the employer and the employee. It is not proposed, at this stage, to extend the range of benefits provided by these PRSI classes.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the recent Barnardos report entitled Childcare in Disadvantaged Areas: A Partnership Approach to Viability. In fact, I launched this report on Wednesday 17 February. In 1994, my Department, in partnership with Area Development Management Limited, initiated and funded the pilot childcare initiative under which once-off capital grants were made available to community childcare projects in disadvantaged areas. On taking office in 1997, I expanded and developed this initiative into the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme. Under this programme, both capital and core funding is provided to community organisations with the aim of improving the qual<Col N="272" /> ity and quantity of childcare provision in Ireland from an equal opportunities/disadvantaged perspective.</P>
      <P>The Barnardos report investigates the success to date of a sample of the organisations who received funding under the pilot childcare initiative and examines the commercial viability of providing childcare in disadvantaged areas and concludes that such services are not financially viable as independent business ventures. The report demonstrates the necessity of local and national interests to contribute to the provision of chiidcare facilities and recommendations are based on a partnership model.</P>
      <P>This issue was amongst those addressed by the Expert Working Group on Childcare which was chaired by my Department and which launched a report on 3 February 1999. The expert working group stressed the importance of a partnership between the State, employers, social partners, local communities and parents with a child-centred approach. The group recommended an integrated package of supply and demand support measures, including funding for local measures.</P>
      <P>Two other reports were published recently which also contain proposals to address the childcare situation &ndash; the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum for Early Childhood Education. Childcare is a complex issue and the three reports differ in relation to the solutions proposed and the issues addressed. The Government, therefore, has established an interdepartmental committee to evaluate, cost and prioritise the childcare proposals in all three reports together with the relevant proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium and to make recommendations to the Government within six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the very wide spectrum of cases and the considerable backlog of applications which I inherited on taking office as Minister it is difficult to identify an average time from start to finish of the asylum determination process which would have any real meaning.</P>
      <P>I can however inform the Deputy that by the end of 1998, all applicants who had sought asylum in this State before January 1997, had been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview. First stage determination of asylum applications follows within a matter of weeks of the substantive interview in most cases, exceptions would be where a reinterview or further detailed inquiries are necessary). By June 1999 it is expected that all applicants who lodged a claim in 1997 will have been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force which I put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with new and old applications simultaneously. At the present rate of progress and based on current application figures I am advised that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July <Col N="274" /> 2000 and from that date will be processing applications within weeks of arrival.</P>
    <P>I appointed Mr. Peter Finlay and Mr. Eamon Cahill to act as appeal authorities (to hear appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status), replacing Mr. Justice Peter O'Malley who retired from the post in July 1998. They commenced hearing cases in September 1998. The two new appeals authorities have heard 338 substantive appeals to 28 February 1999, decisions have been reached in 184 of these cases and refugee status has been granted in 70 cases. In addition, the appeal authorities have considered 17 appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status (on manifestly unfounded grounds) and eight appeals have been successful and nine were refused. I have recently appointed a further two appeals authorities who will be commencing hearing appeals in the near future.</P>
    <P>The number of applications for asylum for the years 1992 to 1999 (to date) are set out hereunder:</P>

    <P>Regarding delays in video link trials a second set of video link equipment was installed in the Four Courts in Dublin in November 1998 to cater for the increase in the volume of cases requiring these facilities. It is expected that the operation of this second system will reduce the waiting time for hearing video link trials in the Circuit Court and also those rape cases in the Central Criminal Court which require the use of video link. Also, consideration is being given to the installation of video link facilities at venues outside Dublin to reduce the number of video link trials being transferred to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, a third permanent judge was assigned to the Circuit Court in Cork. That Act also provided for the appointment of seven additional circuit court judges who were appointed in 1996. Since then the President of the Circuit Court has been tem<Col N="276" /> porarily assigning judges to all venues to try to reduce arrears and eliminate unreasonable delays. These measures have resulted in the elimination of delays in all but three venue i.e. Cork, Limerick and Dundalk. In those three venues the delays in hearing civil cases had been three years in Cork, in excess of two years in Limerick and two years in Dundalk. As the above table indicates, these delays have been greatly reduced and it is expected that this trend will continue until the delays at these venues are eliminated.</P>
    <P>In 1995 there was a 40 per cent increase over 1994 in the volume of cases coming before the Central Criminal Court. Prior to the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, there were two judges hearing cases in the Central Criminal Court. This Act provided for the appointment of three additional High Court judges who were appointed in 1996. This enabled the President of the High Court to make a third judge available to hear cases in the Central Criminal Court. Following a further increase of 23 per cent in 1997 over 1995 in the volume of cases coming before this court a further additional High Court judge was appointed in December 1998 which has enabled the President of the High Court to make a fourth judge available to hear cases in the Central Criminal Court. It is expected that these measures will help to reduce the delay periods in that court.</P>

      <Quest>the number of prisoners; the average service of sentence in the past 12 months; if all prisoners have served their full sentence other than early release for good behaviour or releases in connection with the Good Friday Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The number of prisoners in custody on 5 March 1999 was 2,783 with a further 396 on temporary release. Statistics are not maintained in such a way as to readily enable the calculation of the average proportion of sentences served in any given period.</P>
      <P>The granting of temporary or early release is a feature of prisons systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice. Early temporary release is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</P>
      <P>Prisoners may be granted early release which must be renewed weekly or allowed full temporary release in the last days or weeks of their sentences.</P>
      <P>Before granting early release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons serving sentences for serious crimes such as sex offences, importation or supply of drugs, armed robbery and other cases involving serious violence are not granted periods of tem<Col N="279" /> porary release or released early except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>In a substantial number of cases, the granting of early release may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation. In other words, prisoners may be released earlier than planned due to overcrowding. This has been the case for several years.</P>
    <P>The granting of early temporary release is always subject to conditions. The vast majority of prisoners are granted renewable temporary release and therefore required to report back to the prison from which they were released on a weekly basis. It is also a condition of renewable temporary release that offenders report to their local Garda station on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, 70 spaces have been provided in Limerick Prison together with 152 at the new prison in Castlerea. My Department's prison building programme is on target to make available 995 additional prison places by end 1999. These additional spaces will help eliminate the problem of overcrowding and thereby tackle the need to grant related temporary or early release.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding to Area Development Management Limited, ADM, in respect of two EU supported programmes: the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99, OPLURD; and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, 1996-99, SSPPR.</P>
      <P>Under sub-programme 2 of the OPLURD, ADM receives EU funds to support the local action plans of partnerships and ADM community groups. As at 1 January 1999, with virtually all moneys committed, some £28.2 million of EU funds remain to be spent before programme end. Current forecasts are that these remaining funds will be spent largely in 1999, with the balance being spent early in 2000.</P>
      <P>In terms of funding under the next National Development Plan, my Department recognises the role of area-based strategies in tackling disadvantage and has framed its case for funding on that basis. Given the current stage in the negotiation process for structural funds, it is not possible at this time to accurately estimate the exact contents of the National Development Plan or the amount of funds which will be available in the period 2000-6 either nationally or to any particular organisation. However, the Government has already made it very clear that tackling social inclusion will be a priority in the next national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance is the lead department for the special support programme for peace and reconciliation. EU funding is provided through my Department's Vote to ADM as the implementing body for 11 measures of the SSPPR. The total EU allocation to ADM over the period of the programme is £19.8 million. As at 1 January 1999, with some £2.2 million remaining to be committed, £12.8 million of EU funds remain to be spent under ADM's SSPPR measures before the end of the expenditure period set for the programme &ndash; December 2001.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as <Col N="284" /> may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the students means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases, such as the case outlined by the Deputy. I have asked my Department to keep this issue under review.</P>
