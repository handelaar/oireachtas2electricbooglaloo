      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the staffing levels at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions outlined in the recently published 1998 annual report.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the 1998 Annual Report of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It will be a useful document for all those who deal with the office and an informative guide on the workings of the office for the general public.</P>
      <P>The present staffing of the office is 33, not including the Director, of whom 14 are in legal grades and 19 in administrative grades. The staffing in the office is constantly under review and requests for additional staffing will receive full consideration from both me and the Minister for Finance as they arise. The workload of the office has been acknowledged by increased resources being made available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach concerned that allowing for holidays, etc., the number of files being dealt with by each professional member of the staff, the four barristers and the ten solicitors, works out at on average 500 files per annum, that is, between two and a half and three files per day? Would he agree that it is almost physically and mentally impossible to do justice to these files, to forensically examine them and to give them the time and the type of minute scrutiny which is required to deal adequately with files which have been sent to the office by the Garda and the Chief State Solicitor's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report shows that the numbers of files have increased fairly dramatically in recent years. The number of staff has increased also. There was an independent review of the office conducted by the Department of Finance <Col N="482" /> back in 1995-96 which reported in the winter of 1996. Among its conclusions and recommendations was that there should not be a formalised link between staffing and file numbers but rather that the office workload should be subject to periodic review. That is what happens.</P>
      <P>In his comments, the DPP is not raising problems about the resources of his office. He is raising the issue about the unified prosecution system, which I have mentioned here and which is the subject of the Nally review, on which next month I hope we will have a report.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach concerned that 26 per cent or 1,833 files of the 7,068 files which were referred to the DPP by the Garda and the Chief State Solicitor's office in 1998 were rejected? Is the Taoiseach concerned that one in four of the files, on which a great deal of work has been done and where there has been a huge amount of preparation by the Garda and by the Chief State Solicitor's office, are rejected as not warranting prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> No. It is related directly to staffing. I have already made the point that every legal member of the staff must deal with 500 files. Has the Taoiseach made any attempt to establish whether it is that the files are not being properly prepared or on the other hand that they are not getting the detailed scrutiny which they merit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are straying into an area into which we should not stray. The DPP's office is independent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Correct. I am asking something directly related to the content matter of the file and the report which has been put before the Dáil by the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal staff in the DPP's office are highly competent people and would act independently on all files so I have no comment whatever to make about that, but the resources were reviewed and reported on by the Department of Finance. They are under constant review. They have been increased. As I said, the remaining part, which the director has highlighted, about the unified prosecution system is to be reported on by the Nally report at the end of next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach share the concern of certain senior members of the Garda Síochána that there is a greater obligation <Col N="483" /> of proof required by the DPP's office of files which are sent to it than would normally be required in a court?</P>

        <b>: </b>Questions have long been asked about the efficiency of the Office of the DPP. It has been recommended that from the point of view of its efficiency, it might be worthwhile considering the streamlining of the office, with a view to having a unified prosecution system.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may reply to questions on staffing and efficiency of the office, but not on its decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual report on the Office of the DPP reveals that the office's workload is a heavy one. The office provides effective and efficient service; that has been acknowledged in various independent reviews. As regards the handling of files and the connection the Deputy is making with efficiency, the reviews state that no files showed signs of unnecessary, extensive or unwarranted delay. This was established by the management consultants' report in the winter of 1986. It is hoped that the Nally report will be available by the end of next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During my visit to London on Saturday, I took the opportunity to announce the allocation of £1.2 million in grants for projects involving North-South and east-west co-operation or relating to the island of Ireland. This funding came from money which became available under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, and part of the funds provided for commemoration initiatives. Approximately 52 per cent of the money available has been allocated to projects involving east-west co-operation and projects involving the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that substantial sums had been allocated to support a range of projects which would, in a very practical way, cater for the material and social needs of the weaker and less <Col N="486" /> fortunate members of the Irish community in Britain through such projects as housing for the elderly and homeless, support for parenting, development of community centres, advice and assistance for young Irish people going to Britain and support for individuals and families in particularly difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased that it had been possible to support a significant number of projects containing cross-community or cross-tradition elements which provide opportunities for the Government to demonstrate, in a practical way, the commitments entered into under the Good Friday Agreement to promote reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between the people of Ireland and Britain and to show respect for the diversity of traditions on the island. I am circulating a list of the projects supported with this reply.</P>
    <P>At his invitation, I attended the FA Cup Final with the British Prime Minister and stayed at Chequers on Saturday night. On Saturday night, and again on Sunday morning, we had discussions relating to Northern Ireland. We agreed to continue to work to achieve the 30 June deadline for devolution of powers to the Assembly and the parallel establishment of the related institutions. To that end, I had a number of discussions with the leaders of the parties last week and the parties are continuing their discussions this week. I will keep in contact with the Prime Minister and party leaders, as appropriate, in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I met with representatives of the Garvaghy Road residents on 13 May. The residents raised a number of issues and briefed me on the situation in Portadown and their meetings with Mr. David Trimble, First Minister designate, and Mr. Frank Blair. In responding to the issues raised, I commended the residents on their continuing positive engagement in the mediation efforts that are taking place and I said any outcome should come about only with their agreement. On the issue of further meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, this is not a matter for me, or the Government, but for the chairperson and all the participating parties. I refer the Deputy to my reply to previous questions on 8 December and 6 October last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As there are five questions in my name, I want to ask a number of supplementaries. On the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I appreciate the chairperson will have to make a decision if anything is to happen, but will the Taoiseach at least let his views on the matter be known which might help to get some guidance at this time of political sensitivity with the approach of the 30 June deadline? If there is not to be a resumption of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, will the Taoiseach consider further consultation with the Opposition parties, perhaps even a round table discussion, so that we might be able to deal in more detail with that question? Also, will the Taoiseach indicate whether, in <Col N="488" /> meetings with the British Prime Minister, the issue of a truth commission arose? I ask that question because of the sensitivity of inquiries taking place and threats by the UDA and the UFF in relation to the Pat Finucane inquiry. Should we grasp the nettle of a truth commission so we can begin to satisfy the need for truth which is fundamental if we are to have justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep the parties or the spokespersons informed and will make any briefings they require. My own view is that, with the parties so deeply involved in bilateral and trilateral discussions with their own parties and the fact that they are electioneering, a meeting of the <Col N="489" /> forum at this stage would not be of much use. Perhaps there might be some case for that towards the end of next month, but that is my own view. It is difficult enough to arrange the normal meetings with the parties' schedules, but that is an everyday issue. They meet continuously with each other and a number of useful meetings are taking place, although without much progress.</P>
      <P>The issue of a truth commission has come up from time to time. The South African format or any amended format has not got much support. The opposite can be said for the investigations. There is phenomenal interest from both sides of the community in the Nelson and Finucane inquiries and some of the lower profile cases. They continue to receive a great deal of attention. I will meet tomorrow with a number of the groups involved in those inquiries, including the justice and peace groups and some other party leaders. They will be in the House tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the British Prime Minister changed his position on the obligation to put weapons beyond use from the formula used in the Hillsborough Declaration to the formulations mooted at the recent meeting in Downing Street? Will the Taoiseach comment on the article by Paul Bew in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> which describes this change from the Hillsborough Declaration to the Downing Street formulation as a &ldquo;radical policy reversal, and that the possibility of any IRA decommissioning is fast receding&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hillsborough initiative, which I supported and worked towards, clearly went outside the terms of the Agreement, but it was an effort we thought might gain some acceptance at the time. It did not. In more recent times, the initiative has been to try to bring the Agreement back into play and to follow its original terms, that the executive would be set up, if not fully &ndash; which is unlikely &ndash; in shadow form, and that the issue of arms would then be tackled. That was the original position which should have happened last autumn. I know Paul Bew well but I did not see his article today. I have continually emphasised to the republican movement that it is important that we arrive at a situation where private armies have disappeared and that the number of weapons in circulation is drastically reduced. To achieve that goal it is more important to start making the transition to full democracy in Northern Ireland than to try to hold up that process. If we attempt to hold up progress we are working outside the Agreement. That is where the emphasis is being placed but that does not mean that decommissioning will go off the agenda &ndash; it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What leverage will there be to achieve decommissioning if the parties associated with paramilitaries have achieved all their objectives without decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="490" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We tried a number of methods and I do not think any one of them is preferred. I thought the Hillsborough proposal of putting arms beyond use was a fair compromise in that it allowed everyone to play their part in decommissioning. We had worked out the detail to some degree, but unfortunately and regrettably it was a non-starter.</P>
      <P>The key issue for many of the groups is confidence and the importance of sticking with what was agreed, signed, passed and voted on, what these organisations passed at their annual conferences and such matters. If an executive in transition was set up there was a firm commitment that the arms issue would have to be dealt with by Easter 2000, within the period of the Agreement. Those who argue that the terms of the Agreement have to be followed, in this case the republican movement, must be consistent. If one argues for one aspect of the Agreement one has to argue for the other. The difficulty is that so many aspects of the Agreement which were meant to be followed have been broken. A number of aspects which were passed and voted on and which were meant to be followed through have been broken. This gives people the leverage to disagree. That is one of the difficulties we are experiencing over these weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the British and Irish Governments are united and <i>ad idem</i> in the strategy they are pursuing to ensure that the 30 June deadline they set will be complied with? Are the party leaders in Northern Ireland hearing precisely the same message from the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is no doubt about that. I talked to most of the party leaders in the past few days. Some of the parties point out that 30 June is four days before Drumcree. This could be very difficult for them. Some account has to be taken of this fact. However, at this stage the 30 June deadline, as set down by the British Prime Minister and agreed by me, is the only thing they are hearing. They could move more quickly but that is not their intention for one reason or another. The UUP in particular is not in a position to agree a short-term date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of those who have an interest in this matter but who are not following it in anything like the detail which some Members are doing, is it the position of the two Governments that a shadow shadow Executive would be identified, in other words, that the names of the ten participating members would be revealed? We have the names of the two people nominated at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis. We know the First and Deputy First Minister, but there have been no names from the other nominating parties, such as the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party. Is it proposed to nominate the remaining eight <Col N="491" /> members of the shadow Executive to facilitate movement so that the 30 June deadline can be met?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There are two aspects to that. The shadow Executive, to which Deputy Quinn refers, may or may not meet. It probably will not. Were it to happen, it would be immediate and would be in place for a number of weeks.</P>

      <P>Yes. We would then, between now and 30 June, try to ensure that shadow Executive would become the Executive by the clear understanding that parties close to paramilitary groups would come to some agreement on decommissioning with General John de Chastelain. That is a proposal, but it is one with which the UUP has great difficulty. There have been various reports on the capacity of the proposal to be sold. I would not be certain about it being sold, having spoken to a number of people in the UUP. They have difficulty with the proposal as a short-term one and, if they have difficulty with the short-term proposal, they will have difficulty with the long-term one.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach broached the subject, which was mentioned before in briefings, of some type of symbolic monument comprising some of the arms which would be handed up? Given the statement from the First Minister, David Trimble, of &ldquo;no guns, no government&rdquo;, does the Taoiseach believe it would be worthwhile pursuing that proposal again and making the point to the paramilitaries that to be part of such a gesture would not mean surrender but an attempt to advance the peace process and make it work?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity, or does he believe there will be one, to stress to the Orange Order that, with the Prime Minister and David Trimble meeting the Garvaghy Road residents and Breandán MacCionnaith, it has left everyone wondering to whom it is loyal? Will there be an opportunity through intermediaries to work on the Drumcree situation to the point where we avoid the type of showdown which looks likely unless there is movement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first proposal is precisely what the Hillsborough Declaration sought to do, but it did not work in that form. There is still merit in examining it within the de Chastelain process which is what we tried to do originally. It did not work in that format for reasons which predated the declaration. It could be a possibility were some progress to be made with the shadow Executive. It would then be a matter for General de Chastelain and the parties, especially those with influence. I would pursue that if the first step were achieved because the latter would lead to some confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> The problem is the difficulties facing the peace process. There needs to be more political will to overcome them and to find solutions which are mutually acceptable. If people believe they are in tight corners, it is very hard for them to move. In any successful negotiation, parties must reach out to each other to overcome obstacles.</P>
    <P>However, the Agreement is still being interpreted in a far too rigid and inflexible manner by some of the parties on both sides and this has created difficulties. The only way progress can be made is through use of and close adherence to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. As I informed Deputy Bruton earlier, the British Government sees this as the most likely avenue to success.</P>
    <P>We are entering the marching season and there is a danger that, in the event of continued delays and procrastination, the security situation will deteriorate further. Although they have received little publicity, nightly attacks are being made almost exclusively on Nationalist areas. At last count 158 such attacks had taken place, but I am sure events at the weekend have added to that figure. I welcome remarks made by Gary McMichael, Billy Hutchison and David Ervine in recent days, but a number of loyalist splinter groups are terrorising Nationalist areas by means of pipe bombs, nail bombs, fire bombs and gun attacks. This has led to a great deal of concern on the part of the RUC. Through the Secretariat, the British Prime Minister has been pressing the RUC to try to step up its actions. There is always the possibility that other groups will respond to this type of provocation, particularly as the marching season progresses.</P>
    <P>A great deal of effort is being made to resolve the crisis at Drumcree, most recently in the form of Frank Blair's initiative. I welcome the dialogue which has taken place, particularly that involving Mr. Trimble. Again, the pace is slow. Last week we hoped that progress would have been more rapid. Newspaper reports regarding what happened last week in respect of Drumcree are correct. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, none of the meetings planned to progress that initiative took place. Frank Blair is continuing to make efforts to resolve the matter this week. We are encouraging and assisting those initiatives and doing everything possible to provide help to those on all sides, not only the residents of the Garvaghy Road but also Mr. Trimble. In my opinion, Mr. Trimble will endeavour to continue his initiatives next week and Seamus Mallon is prepared and anxious to work with him in that regard, which is helpful.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach of the opinion that the British Prime Minister has fully considered the action he will take in the event that the 30 June deadline is not met? Will he dissolve the Assembly or does he know exactly what he intends to do in the event that the deadline is not met? How is it possible to reconcile the 30 June deadline for an agreement with the 12 month <Col N="493" /> extension granted in respect of the constitutional change mechanism? What political calculations were made by the Taoiseach and his British counterpart in deciding to publicise the Hillsborough Declaration when they did, given that this invited the possibility of public rejection, rather than using it as a working document for private negotiation, which might have been more prudent?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I made an announcement about its basic contents. Details of the indepth discussions which had taken place were not announced. These were hinted at but not pursued and they remain, as Deputy Sargent stated, to be dealt with by General de Chastelain. Only the basic contents of the agreement were announced and these had already become available on the previous evening. The reason they were announced the previous night was that the indications were that it would be accepted, including by Sinn Féin, who strongly rejected it afterwards.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister has been endeavouring to put as much pressure as possible on those concerned to ensure movement now. A fair amount of thought has been given to the 30 June deadline. At all times that has to be considered. I am conscious that the Garvaghy Road issue will arise three for four days later. We will have to see if we can achieve finality by 30 June. Clearly, that will be difficult because of the elections and the marching season. The British Prime Minister has told all the parties in strong terms that he believes that date is final. He emphasised the fact that he has set down only two dates &ndash; 10 April, when he supported Senator George Mitchell, and 30 June. There were many other dates in the process but they were not stipulated by him.</P>
      <P>On the reason for the 12 month extension, I can envisage a position where we could still find ourselves in dialogue and facing some difficulties. Even if we were to get to the stage, which would be great, of finding a way to set up the Executive, we would still have all the other institutions to set up which will involve a great deal of work. We are unlikely to get all of those set up by 30 June, regardless of what happens. It would take an enormous effort and would be extremely difficult. There is no point in saying we are not achieving the first part of the institutional changes by 30 June. There is no possibility of getting all the institutional changes in place by that date. That is why another year is needed.</P>

      <P>If progress has not been made by 1 July or if progress was made by 1 July but decommissioning was not complied with in accordance with the Agreement, as set out by the end of the second year, I presume all bets would be off and we would return to the post anti situation which was the Anglo-Irish Agreement, direct rule from London and the secretariat in Maryfield and all the institutional changes &ndash; the cross-Border bodies and the Assembly in Northern Ireland &ndash; would come to an end and some form of plan B, based on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, would have to be considered by the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach. Is that a correct analysis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Agreement fails anywhere along the way &ndash; that is not what we want to contemplate &ndash; none of the institutions would be set up, including the Assembly, which was widely talked about last week in the North. The Assembly and all the other institutional matters of the Agreement would bite the dust. That is not what any of the parties are thinking of. The bigger difficulty is the timescale. Almost all the parties work on the basis of viewing things into the future and going at a snail's pace, which is extremely dangerous. Somebody somewhere has to show leadership and take chances on moving. Sometimes one party makes a move and at another time that same party blocks a move. That is the difficulty. As I have continually said, it is pointless forcing people against their wishes. They all have to be brought together in an inclusive process. It will not work unless they work together because at the end of the day there has to be cross-community support in the Assembly, agreement between the parties that make up the Executive and agreement between the Deputy First Minister and the Ministers in the other institutions which involve North-South bodies. This also applies to the British-Irish associations. It will not work if there is no agreement. As was pointed out last week, there will be no achievements without cross-community support. This is why we must painstakingly try to win cross-community support and the support of the parties which will ultimately make up the assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, does the Taoiseach agree that the setting of deadlines has not been productive or felicitous? There has been the failed deadline of the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. The Hillsborough agreement was apparently accepted but subsequently rejected. Two weeks ago in Downing Street, it appeared an agreement had been accepted by all <Col N="495" /> the participants, but it was subsequently rejected. We were told that the 11 June date of the European elections was a deadline which had to be overcome and another deadline of 30 June was set. The Taoiseach suggested today that Drumcree, which will be four days later, is another matter which is interfering with that deadline.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree recent experience informs us that deadlines do not concentrate minds? What is required is the reapplication of all the participants to the Good Friday Agreement and for them to demonstrate a willingness for movement. In that respect, movement from the IRA and Sinn Féin on the principles of decommissioning is required as much as participation in the shadow Executive is necessary from the Unionist side. Does the Taoiseach see merit in the view that Members of this House could meet with participants in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to reinforce that message? Such a meeting could concentrate on persuading Sinn Féin and its colleagues in the IRA that some further movement on their part is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be of value at some stage. However, the Deputy is correct that if we had stuck to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the shadow Executive should have been established last autumn and the North-South bodies should have been in operation by 31 October. Unfortunately, Mr. Trimble and the UUP could not meet those deadlines. This allowed the delay with regard to decommissioning. If progress had been made on the first two items, we would have made enormous progress by Christmas. There was an attempt to resolve the matter in Hillsborough, but we had moved away from the Agreement. This is the difficulty. Mr. Trimble did his best last week and Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness did their best at Easter. However, none of them succeeded in convincing their constituencies to make the progress they thought possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our judgment is that the only way to move forward is to try to get everybody to focus on making progress and to sign off and give leadership on some of the issues as they stand. I understand their difficulties and I am aware of what happened at the UUP meetings in the past few weeks. I am also aware of what happened at the Sinn Féin meetings at Easter. They are not unconnected. These are the difficulties and <Col N="496" /> although it is painstaking and slow, we must continue to try to convince people to move forward.</P>
    <P>If everybody wants to win on every issue, it will be difficult to find a solution. Somebody must compromise on some of these issues. One will never get a formula which is a victory for one side and a loss for the other, and get the latter to agree. This is impossible in negotiations. One must get people to move to the middle. However, even when one moves to the middle and the leaders and the negotiating teams agree, the larger groups reject the proposals. We must continue trying to find something which will be acceptable to the larger groups. We are in this position because everything is being interpreted in far too rigid and inflexible a manner. To correct Deputy Quinn, if he took this from what I said, 30 June remains the date and the parties should see there would be a great deal of benefit in making progress prior to Drumcree and the marching season. They have a difficulty with that, which was stated to me last night.</P>

      <P>What would the Taoiseach say to those who might observe a radical change in position with regard to the obligation to put arms beyond use from what was said at Hillsborough, which asserted that obligation, and what was said at Downing Street, which seemed to remove it from the realm of immediate practical politics? What would he say to people who suggest that the Governments did not have firm convictions on this issue and were simply trying to split the difference between the parties? Given that the Governments have a fundamental requirement to ensure there are no private armies in either jurisdiction, and that this is of interest to the parties also, what would the Taoiseach say to those who might advance a doubt about how the Governments could change their position so dramatically between Hillsborough and Downing Street?</P>
      <P>Can he assure the House that he and the British Prime Minister have worked out a full scenario for what they will do and say on 1 July if the 30 June deadline is not met? Does he not agree that precedents elsewhere in Europe in recent times, involving the British Prime Minister and others, suggest that setting deadlines without a plan B can be quite imprudent?</P>

      <P>Given that the lack of progress on the vexed and continuing question of decommissioning runs the risk of poisoning the entire Agreement, and that the Taoiseach has conceded that time is not on the side of those in the business of forging an agreement, does he accept that one man's role in this affair has been underplayed and that consideration should be given to enhancing or extending the role of General John de Chastelain? His is the one reputation which has been, if not enhanced, certainly maintained over the 12 months since the referendum. Did the Taoiseach discuss in his meetings with the British Prime Minister over the past week or more, the idea of inviting the IRA Army Council to meet <Col N="497" /> General de Chastelain directly, prior to a public statement by the general, which is somewhat overdue? Does the Taoiseach see merit in that idea? Given that the general will probably have only one bite at the cherry, his public utterance is highly important. Does the Taoiseach favour such an enhancement of the role of the independent chairman of the commission?</P>

      <P>At Hillsborough an effort was made to break the impasse by moving outside the Agreement. If any criticism is to be made of the Prime Minister and I, it is that we tried to go away from the Agreement, having had six months of foot dragging and people not sticking to deadlines or doing what they were obliged to do. We knew the Hillsborough Declaration went outside the Agreement but we thought we could get the parties to agree to it and we almost did. As I said earlier, some of those matters might come back into play again but as I also said, this shows why we are better off sticking to the Agreement. The Governments can stick to it but it is more difficult to get the parties to meet the deadlines &ndash; they have continually broken them. A number of the deadlines last year were clearly broken on one side rather than the other. However, I have tried to maintain a balance.</P>
      <P>On the decommissioning issue, I had a long discussion with the British Prime Minister on Sunday morning about how we would handle it in June. I foresee plenty of difficulties and I discussed those and how they could be managed. I also discussed them with some of the parties.</P>
      <P>General John de Chastelain is ready and available to do as Deputy Flanagan outlined. He is anxious to move on these matters but he cannot do so under the Agreement until there is at least some progress on the Executive. Clearly, he can be of tremendous assistance if we reach that stage but we must wait and see if progress can be made before that happens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of store cattle is generally a function of market forces &ndash; supply and demand. This is particularly so with regard to the price of finished cattle. Since the beginning of this year, store cattle prices have improved <Col N="498" /> considerably. Although still down on this time last year, the trend has been in the right direction and there is some movement towards paying better differentials for quality cattle. Factory quotations for U type steers are within 2p per lb of last year's levels whereas Friesian type steers are back by 4p per lb. Poorer grass growth in spring in conjunction with the fodder scarcity carried over from last year and the lower prices for finished cattle has impacted on the demand for store animals.</P>
      <P>While cattle prices have improved generally since the beginning of the year and reflect the continuing recovery of export markets, the process takes time. The collapse of the Russian market in particular has impacted on third country sales. EU markets continue to improve but the continuing preference on those markets for beef of domestic origin is delaying a more rapid recovery. The buoyancy of the live trade to EU markets is, however, having a major positive impact on weanling prices and I am hopeful that this trade, in conjunction with a general improvement in the beef trade, will impact on the prices of all cattle categories, including stores, over the coming months.</P>
      <P>With regard to Libya, agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation last July providing for the reopening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the General People's Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
      <P>Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle. These delays are of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities, through every appropriate channel, with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice. The Libyan authorities have indicated, as recently as 1 May, that current economic conditions in Libya have resulted in the postponement of the implementation of the agreement but pointed out that they have never failed in the past to honour any agreement reached with another state. I am hopeful, therefore, that the agreement will be honoured and I will continue to take every appropriate step to ensure this outcome.</P>
      <P>The only other traditional market for live cattle is Egypt and while it is my objective that all markets should be open to Irish cattle, it should be noted that the nature of that market has changed for Ireland. Egypt has now become the largest market for Irish beef, importing 120,000 tonnes of beef in 1998, which is the equivalent of over 350,000 head of cattle.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, achieved to date in his discussions with the EU Commission to obtain clearance for control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes; the nature of the discussions; the level of grant aid proposed in both of the schemes; when discussions will be concluded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In the Department Estimates for 1999, an additional £25 million is being provided for on-farm investment schemes to be targeted towards those farmers most in need of assistance. The new national scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards has been formally approved by the European Commission and is now in operation. Application forms for the scheme are available in the local farm development service offices of my Department. The scheme provides for grant aid at the rate of 40 per cent in the less favoured areas and 35 per cent in the other areas subject to a grant ceiling of £7,000.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposed new control of farm pollution scheme, officials of my Department met the European Commission earlier this month to address the issues which the Commission had raised with regard to the draft proposals submitted to it for approval in February of this year. The Commission had expressed reservations that some of the proposed eligible investment items were production oriented rather than environmental measures. Arising from the discussions, further written clarifications on the environmental nature of the investments were provided to the Commission to allow the approval process to be completed.</P>
      <P>The rates of grant aid proposed for this scheme are similar to those outlined for the scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards but the maximum grant would be £10,000. I am confident the new scheme for the control of farm pollution will be approved and introduced in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the worries of the EU Commission? It always seems to have reser<Col N="501" /> vations and caveats regarding any scheme put forward by Ireland. Has the Minister told the Commission that the pressure for better facilities is driven by pollution control requirements, rural environment protection, quality food assurance, livestock welfare, shortage of labour and the elimination of drudgery from farming? That is what this is about. Will the application for the new CFP scheme have to be accompanied by a nutrient plan or a REPS plan, which would satisfy the nutrient requirement, or planning permission or a certificate of exemption and a calculation of the income units, with a maximum of 100 units being the criterion to verify eligibility? Are those the criteria required for eligibility under the new scheme? Would it be advisable for farmers, unless they can proceed without the need to get grant approval for capital expenditure, to postpone their application for REPS until approval for the CFP scheme is received?</P>
      <P>This scheme has not been announced. What am I to say about this proposed scheme to drystock farmers in Kilbeggan and other such places in the midlands as June approaches? It will take those farmers three months to get planning permission for the necessary infrastructural facilities they want to put in place to house their cattle. When will the scheme be announced? Is Brussels trying to delay its introduction?</P>
      <P>Is it the case that £25 million that is to be allocated will not be sufficient because of the number of farmers who were awaiting payments under the old scheme when it was suspended and who are now part of the matured liability to which the Minister of State probably referred previously? He told the Dáil a month ago that he expected approval for the CFP scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme to be granted within days. He got approval for the dairy hygiene scheme but not for the CFP scheme. Why is there a difference between the two schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could have given approval for the scheme, I would have given approval for it in February, but this scheme is regarded as a direct aid to farmers and, as such, it is subject to approval from Brussels. A proposed scheme was forwarded to Brussels in February 1999 and Brussels is being extremely difficult about it. I could have announced the scheme a month ago, but I want the scheme to be broadly based and to provide for housing and facilities for livestock during poor weather conditions in the winter and because of the lack of fodder. That is what is holding up the approval.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed and disappointed about it because there is adequate finance for it. Members who have had to deal with Departments will know that the most difficult job is to get approval for a scheme from the Department of Finance. We have got that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that the Commission is holding up this scheme. The Commission questioned the environmental benefit of some of the investment items proposed for grant aid under the <Col N="502" /> scheme, including certain animal housing. Animal housing is required in this country and it is ridiculous to introduce a control of farmyard pollution scheme that does not contain a housing element. I am holding out for that element in the scheme. Officials of the Department met Commission officials on 7 May and it usually takes three weeks for approval to be granted and that would bring us up to 28 May. I expect and hope that approval for the scheme will be granted before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In order to focus the grant aid on farmers who are most in need of such aid, it is proposed to limit the scheme to applicants with 100 income units or less. A nutrient management plan will be required as a condition of the scheme because environmental protection is vital. I would advise applicants to make preparations for this scheme by getting approval within the next few weeks so that they will be able to proceed immediately approval is granted. I alerted the Department to have application forms available for this scheme and the dairy hygiene grant scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Western Development Commission has not been given authority to spend the £7 million allocated to it following legislation passed in February 1999; the consultation, if any, with the EU concerning the status of the Western Development Investment Fund prior to the legislation being passed to ascertain if moneys or equity shares from the fund would be classified as State aid; if his attention has been drawn to the many projects evaluated since September 1998 and shelved; and if his attention has further been drawn to the great anger and resentment over the lack of action on this matter in the west.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Western Development Commission Act, 1998, requires that aid provided to enterprises or projects by the commission shall be in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as the commission determines, subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The commission, which I established under the Act on 1 February this year, decided at its meeting on 7 April how the western investment fund is to be used, including the forms of aid. Consequently, the terms and conditions to be applied to aid could not be finalised before then. My Department was in consultation with the non-statutory commission on this matter since last November. In accordance with the Act, I recently sought the agreement of the Minister for Finance for a set of terms and conditions to be applied to aid provided from the fund and I expect a decision very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> It was not appropriate to hold consultations with the European Commission, prior to the passage of the Act, on the question of aid from the fund being classified as State aid. Given that the fund is Exchequer financed, it would be most likely to be regarded as State aid and, in the circumstances, there would have been little point in pursuing the matter prior to the Western Development Commission taking a definitive decision on the forms of aid to be provided. Now that it has done so, I hope to have clarified this week whether a formal notification to the European Commission is necessary. In that event, the notification will be submitted without delay. It is important to remember that, under the EC Treaty, a member state must not implement its proposed measures until the European Commission has considered them and reached a decision. The Commission can require aid not notified to it to be repaid, even long after the aid has been granted.</P>
    <P>In relation to projects seeking aid from the fund, no projects have been shelved by the Western Development Commission. I expect that any projects on hand will be considered fully and adjudicated on once the fund is operational.</P>
    <P>The Government has given a commitment that £25 million will be provided for the western investment fund over a six year period from 1998. This commitment will not falter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has a very short memory. When the legislation was going through the Dáil, I asked him if the aid that would given to the Western Development Commission would be regarded as State aid. He said, and I agreed with him at the time because I did not know any better, that he thought that because shares and equity would be used it would be treated differently by Brussels. I put it to the Minister of State and his officials that he should have known it would be regarded as State aid at that time.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission has been treated with contempt. Approximately 150 projects were evaluated as long ago as last September or October and not a penny has changed hands.</P>
      <P>If my information is correct and if the Minister of State must seek approval in respect of the aid being classified as state aid, it could be next October or November before we get an answer to this. If the Western Development Commission is to be treated in a manner in which the Minister of State and I would like to seek it working&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;by the Department of Finance &ndash; as the Minister said, that can be difficult to secure. This is unique legislation and it is the first time it has been tried in Ireland. We did not want to insist that it was State aid at that time because we did not want to pre-empt decisions that might be made by the European Commission. We will know this week whether we must approach the Commission formally on this. If we must, a reply normally takes two months, but there is a fast-track procedure whereby a reply could be given in one month. Given the unique position of the west and the atmosphere created by this legislation, I believe an exception can be made in this regard.</P>
      <P>Approximately 70 or more projects have been considered or are still being assessed by the Western Development Commission. More than £600,000 will be spent to cover the cost of staff and payments for this year alone.

      <P>Nearly 7,000 tonnes of intervention beef, the property of the European Community, was destroyed in January 1992 in the course of a fire. This beef, in common with all stocks of intervention beef held in Ireland on behalf of the Community, has been fully insured by the Department for all risks and the necessary premium paid.</P>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath of the fire, liability was repudiated by the lead insurers with which the insurance had first been placed. At the same time, the Department was informed by its broker that the risk had also been placed with a second lead insurer some months before the fire. The Department submitted a claim to its broker for £23 million on 27 January 1992. Liability was denied by the insurers and a complicated process of litigation was initiated.</P>
      <P>Some insurance companies have sought a declaration against the Department that they have no liability in this matter. There are six separate sets of proceedings on this issue and particulars are being exchanged at present. It is possible that these cases can be brought to court within a year. The Department has taken a separate case against other insurers, who are challenging the jurisdiction of the Irish courts. The High Court has already found in the Department's favour on this but this finding is being appealed to the Supreme Court. This case may be heard before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Most small abattoirs must conform to the standards of an export licensed premises without grant aid. Perhaps the Minister will comment on the fact that most small abattoir owners inform me that the conditions in relation to abattoirs change every year and investment which would have been good enough to get a licence last year or the year before would not be good enough <Col N="508" /> now. Many abattoirs will be forced to close because they did not receive a definitive set of regulations when they started business. Is it planned that under certain conditions, abattoir owners with under 1,000 livestock units will get grant aid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of amendments have been made to the Abattoirs Act, 1988. The Deputy is aware that in 1997 there was an order to extend the application of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, to include the slaughter of ratite or running birds, ostriches, emus and rheas. In 1997 an amendment was made to provide for the application of the health mark by a veterinary inspector on the meat of these birds. Amendments made in 1998 laid down the requirements for the construction and operation of abattoirs slaughtering ratite birds and provided for the carrying out of ante and post-mortem examinations on slaughtered ratite birds. Regulations were also introduced to amend the grounds upon which animals or meat may be declared to be unfit for human consumption to include the condition of the hide, fleece or skin of an animal. This relates to the point raised by the Deputy about clean cattle which is important for safety and quality. Another amendment to the Act was made by order in 1998 to address refrigeration and the bleeding and dressing of the animals.</P>
      <P>Those are the amendments to the Abattoirs Act, 1988, which were a cause of concern to small abattoir owners. We must protect the consumer. As the Deputy is aware, in the past four or five years many changes have taken place as people have become more consumer conscious. It is all about the safety of the product and quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone accepts we must maintain standards, which is what most abattoir owners are doing. Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that conditions will be laid down as of now so that when owners invest in their premises the regulations will not be changed within a specified time after they make an investment and before they get a licence? Does the Minister think that abattoirs under 1,000 units should be grant aided in some form?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to stop the feeding of meat and bone animal meal to pigs in view of the fact that one of the requirements of our major export market, the United Kingdom, is the non-use of meat and bone meal in pigs' diets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The production of meat and bone meal here for feeding to non-ruminant animals is undertaken in accordance with comprehensive control arrangements which are based on scientific recommendations. Specified risk material is excluded from this process and the remaining material is rendered in accordance with EU parameters in approved plants which are under departmental supervision and which must meet specified conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pigs which have been fed meat and bone meal and product therefrom can be traded on the EU Single Market provided they meet animal health conditions laid down in European legislation. As the trade in pigs which have been fed meat and bone meal is legal and there is no scientific basis for imposing such a ban, it is therefore a matter <Col N="510" /> for individual producers and exporters to make decisions in regard to such trade. The ban in the UK on the feeding of meat and bone meal to any species was introduced in 1996 in response to the high incidence of BSE in that country and remains in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural development regulation that was formally adopted by the Agriculture Council on 17 May last as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement provides for continued support for early retirement from farming. Under the new regulation, the provisions of which cannot apply <Col N="511" /> before 1 January 2000, applications may be accepted from part-time farmers and the enlargement requirement will be replaced by a provision linked to the improved viability of the holding transferred. The new scheme also provides for possible changes in relation to the level and duration of pension payments. Detailed rules for the implementation of the regulation have yet to be agreed.</P>
      <P>The new early retirement scheme to apply in Ireland will form part of the rural development plan which my Department must submit to the European Commission within six months of adoption of the Council regulation. The Commission will approve such a plan within six months of submission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State. Will the 50:50 rule, whereby a part-time farmer had to earn more than 50 per cent of his income from farming, be relaxed under the new Agenda 2000 negotiations? It is very important for the pension to be increased in line with inflation. I welcome the removal of the enlargement clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that has been changed to allow for the inclusion of part-time farmers. It will help to address many of the effects, particularly farm size and the age profile of farmers. That has been very successful. In the initial stages we thought 7,000 farmers would join by 1998 but, in fact, 8,800 joined. There is room for many more part-time farmers to join under the new regulations, which the Minister, Deputy Walsh, negotiated successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What level of income is it intended that part-time farmers will be able to earn outside farming? Will it be 40, 60 or 70 per cent? Is the duration of the pension still open for negotiation by the Minister with the European Union, to extend its lifetime to 75 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The pension is not being extended to 70 years. However, consideration is being given to paying the pension over a ten or 15 year period, if that suits some people.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements, which will not apply until 1 January 2000, part-time farmers may be eligible to join the early retirement scheme. The enlargement of the farm by a minimum of five acres or 10 per cent required under the existing scheme will be replaced by the provision for an improved viability of holding transfer. The Department is currently examining options in that area. The Deputy will be aware that these matters are still under negotiation with the European Union. However, the principle of part-time farmers being included has been accepted. The rest is a matter for detailed negotiation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the most recent OECD review that highlighted the high levels of environmentally hazardous waste from agriculture, including the production of greenhouse gases such as methane; the measures his Department proposes to reduce the levels of livestock; the policy measures he proposes other than the REP scheme to significantly reduce the methane output from agriculture; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13640/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent review prepared by the economic and development review committee of the OECD, entitled &ldquo;OECD Economic Surveys 1998-1999, Ireland&rdquo;. Among the environmental issues referred to in the OECD report are the disposal of hazardous waste and the restraint of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Under Part II of the National Waste Management Act, 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency is required to prepare a national hazardous waste management plan, a draft of which will be published this summer for public consultation. This plan will identify sources of hazardous waste and make recommendations for prevention, collection, recovery and disposal of such wastes. National policy in relation to the management of such wastes, including those originating in the agriculture sector, will be determined when the national hazardous waste management plan is adopted formally by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> The position regarding greenhouse gas emissions is that Ireland has committed itself to the restraint of such emissions as a result of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and based on an internal sharing at EU level. Ireland has to hold the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2008-12 to 13 per cent above our 1990 levels, while the overall EU level must be cut by 8 per cent. A national abatement strategy is being developed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in consultation with other Departments, including my Department. To ensure my Department can play a full part in the development of the abatement strategy, I have established an expert group on greenhouse gases, which includes representatives from the EPA, Teagasc, the IFA, the ICMSA, and UCD, to examine the impact of the agricultural sector on greenhouse gas emissions and to consider possible action which might be pursued in the agriculture sector with the aim of securing greenhouse gas emission over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The recent Agenda 2000 agreement provides that member states may include minimum environmental conditions for the receipt of direct payments in respect of agricultural production. While the detailed rules governing this measure have not yet been agreed, it is likely that producers getting direct payments will have to follow good farming practice.</P>
    <P>Some 43,000 farmers are currently participating in the rural environmental protection scheme. Participation in REPs is regarded as going beyond good farming practice. The scheme will play an important part in addressing environmental issues in the agricultural sector, with a significant increase in the number of participants expected in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know of any proposals in the Department which would necessitate farmers having to apply for a licence to apply slurry to their lands? Will all farmers have to adhere to certain farming practices if they are to get cattle headage payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many people have suggested ideas such as licensing. The Department is anxious to use the findings of the expert group to examine the impact of the agricultural sector on greenhouse gas emissions, including developments since 1990 and projections for the period up to 2010.</P>
      <P>Slurry application is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Deputy will agree that anyone spreading slurry should be extremely careful. I was delighted to hear an advertisement by Teagasc and the IFA advising those using silage to ensure no effluent enters the river system. We have witnessed enough disasters. We have clean rivers and I hope this will continue as part of rural development.</P>

There was a complaint recently about a farmer who sprayed slurry while the wind was blowing towards three houses. All three were splashed with slurry. That was a stupid thing to do. It is a pity the wind did not change direction towards the person involved. Other people have to be considered and facilitated.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, taken or envisaged to fulfil the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium to carry out the most fundamental review of his Department since it was set up in 1900 and to focus on its central mission of developing policy to ensure Irish agriculture reaches its full potential; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13582/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Changing demands and circumstances and a need to continuously improve efficiency and effectiveness have highlighted the need for certain improvements in the organisation and structure of my Department. To address these issues, a fundamental review of the structure and work practices was instituted. This review also took account of the relevant Government decisions regarding FEOGA payments and food safety and the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to focus the Department on its central mission &ndash; developing policy to ensure Irish agriculture reaches its full potential.</P>
      <P>It has been decided that the Department should be reorganised on three broad pillars representing the three principal areas of activity &ndash; policy development, food safety and production and FEOGA payments. These arrangements will separate policy and executive functions, while maintaining the necessary relationships between them to ensure coherence in negotiations at EU level, in other international fora and in the implementation of various programmes and schemes.</P>
      <P>Progress on the implementation of these proposals on food safety and production had to take account of the Government decision to establish a Food Safety Authority of Ireland under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children as this would have a significant influence on the future role of the Department in connection with food safety and, consequently, for the most appropriate organisation for this function within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been engaged, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, in the development of arrangements for the implementation by the Department of the extensive functions to be conducted by it on behalf of <Col N="516" /> the authority. These arrangements have considerable organisational implications for the Department, not least because many of the staff engaged on food safety work also carry out functions concerning FEOGA operations.</P>
    <P>The Department is in the process of transferring to Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, on a phased basis, the work and staff posts of most Dublin-based FEOGA divisions other than those that deal with headage and premia schemes. Some 290 posts are being transferred on a phased basis, representing a very substantial decentralisation. The first two of the FEOGA divisions concerned moved to Wexford on schedule in September 1998 and April 1999.</P>
    <P>Given that the position on the establishment of the FSAI has been clarified, and that the decentralisation is well under way, I am now in a position to progress to conclusion the work which has been under way in my Department to give effect to the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to establish an agency to administer FEOGA and other payments. A draft memorandum to Government was circulated to other Departments and I am awaiting their final observations before submitting proposals to establish the agency to the Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>The highly successful outcome of the recent Agenda 2000 proposals clearly illustrates the strength of my Department in the areas of policy development and negotiation. The challenge now facing the Department is to progress with the reorganisation of its structure and operations to deliver the potential of this package and other policy initiatives to the optimum benefit of Irish agriculture and the Irish economy. This will entail meeting the strictest criteria of financial accountability while ensuring services are responsive to clients' needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the fact that food safety is one of the three pillars of the reorganisation taking place within the Department. Was there significant resistance in the Department to the establishment of the independent agency to administer FEOGA and other payments? Some people think that is the reason for the delay in its establishment.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister given any thought to an independent appeals system for those who feel aggrieved at the levels of penalty imposed on grants received by them or the number of grants refused to them? That would be an important element of a root and branch review of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I entered office, substantial decentralisation has taken place to Portlaoise and that unit is working well. My predecessor, Deputy Yates, made the decision to decentralise to Wexford, to where substantial decentralisation has taken place. That process is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft memorandum concerning the FEOGA agency has been circulated to other Departments and we are awaiting replies before putting in <Col N="517" /> place that element of the restructuring. In the meantime the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been established. That is a huge organisation. It falls under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, but much of the work is being done by officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food on contract to it. During the period of its establishment Deputies, committees and lobby groups complained that there was not great efficiency. Under those circumstances, there has been definite progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied this separation can occur at local level, where personnel dealing with the basics of food safety also deal with FEOGA? It would be much easier to divide it at national rather than local level. Is the Minister satisfied there are sufficient numbers of staff at local office level to ensure programmes already in place are properly administered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally the Department of Agriculture and Food is highly efficient in the administration of various schemes. No doubt the complex schemes which emanated from the 1992 CAP reform placed a huge burden on the administration of the Department. The provision of IT and computer facilities in the meantime has facilitated the good working of that operation. Recently in an official publication of the EU the Department of Agriculture and Food was seen as one of the better Departments in the administration and implementation of various programmes and schemes.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the general finding of the recent Cromien review of the systems and procedures was that the Department of Agriculture and Food had confirmed that there had been substantial and sustained improvement in systems and procedures in the Department since the late 1980s and the early 1990s.</P>

      <P>Beef cattle breeding in Ireland was, until recently, fragmented between a number of organisations including my Department, AI societies and beef breed societies. However, the pooling of resources and expertise to form the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation now provides a real opportunity to have greater industry participation in cattle breeding and to make significant progress in developing the breed characteristics of beef cattle. One of the main objectives of the ICBF is to improve the genetic merit of the national herd.</P>
      <P>My Department is also involved in discussions with the meat processing industry and farming organisations with a view to introducing a pricing system which adequately rewards quality beef production and encourages producers to improve the beef characteristics of their cattle. I understand that the Task Force on the Beef Industry which I set up last November is also addressing this issue.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the many agricultural initiatives he has introduced. Will he comment on the suitability of current breeds for the European and international markets?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the scrub bull has had a deleterious effect on the national cattle herd. The quality of beef cattle has deteriorated in the past seven or eight years. About 80 per cent are unsuited to the remunerative high quality continental markets like France and Germany. Where only 20 per cent qualify, there is something radically wrong. There are a number of reasons for this: the use of poor quality bulls; the change in the composition of live exports and the absence of any significant price differentials based on the classification rate and not helped by re-nationalisation of EU markets. In other words, flat pricing is an absolute disaster. There is an urgent need to up-grade and improve the quality of the beef herd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome payment on a graded and quality basis. The difficulty is that there is not sufficient confidence between the <Col N="519" /> farmers and the meat factories to do that because, as the Deputy will be aware, the assessment is subjective. The National Food Centre at Dunsinea is evaluating objective mechanical systems for the grading of animals. If there is an objective system, then that will instil confidence and farmers will be happy to accept payment on a graded or quality basis.</P>
      <P>In general, apart from factories there is a differential for good quality cattle at marts. It is in the interests of farmers to improve the quality of the breed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulty at present is that we are dependent on opportunistic markets in third countries for a great deal of exports. We have lost out heavily in the continental European market and in the UK market. Much of the reason for that was the BSE difficulty in 1996 but there was also the problem of the renationalisation of those markets and the unsuitability of much of our beef. As soon as there is an improvement in the quality of beef and there is an objective method for payment on a graded system, that will be done and can be implemented quickly.</P>

      <P>The question tabled by Deputy Spring on 10 September 1997 related to the 1982-7 period when the Fianna Fáil party was in Opposition. I explained to him on that occasion that I had spoken to the administrator and did not believe anything was wrong.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to state at the outset that I brought this matter to the attention of the Moriarty tribunal so that its significance and relevance, if any, could be determined by the tribunal having regard to all of the information it alone is in a position to assemble. I acted correctly in so doing and have co-operated fully in meeting any subsequent inquiries and requests. I am anxious to continue acting correctly in a situation where certain information, originally supplied by me, has become public without its exact significance having been established.</P>
      <P>The Moriarty tribunal has, under the terms of reference given to it by Dáil Éireann, conducted a great deal of its most important work confidentially. The tribunal regards it as imperative to maintain confidentiality during the private phase investigation of each aspect until it is ready to conduct public hearings. In this way, any matter which cannot be substantiated is sifted out and unfounded and damaging allegations are not brought into the public arena where unwarranted damage could be done to innocent reputations. Partial, unnecessary selective discussion in the Dáil is prejudicial to the work of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Where third parties, whose willing co-operation is essential to the expeditious work of the tribunal, are involved, their constitutional rights must be protected. I have been advised by the Attorney General that the disclosure of such correspondence which relates exclusively to my obligation of confidentiality to the tribunal and which does not disclose the identity of third parties or in any way impinge on their constitutional rights would be permissible. In the circumstances, I propose to put parts of the relevant correspondence on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>I should add that I sought the advice of the Attorney General on the matter as I was being asked to account to the Dáil in my capacity as Taoiseach. In normal circumstances, I would have been happy to amplify and add to the statement I made in this House on 10 September 1997, which related to a different period, on the basis of information which came into my possession a year subsequently. Indeed, I have already done so today in two respects. I would not have had any difficulty in making a statement if permitted to do so by the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> Of course, many questions arise which none of us is in a position to answer definitively. That is why we have established a tribunal to provide answers. If we sincerely hope to get to the truth of the matter, we should all co-operate fully with the tribunal, as I will. In the most recent contacts with representatives of the tribunals, they again reiterated forcibly the necessity for confidentiality during this phase of their work. This confidential phase was agreed to by the Opposition parties during negotiations establishing the terms of reference. Indeed, the tribunal has made it clear that any person holding a position of responsibility could not fail to have regard to the obligations of the tribunal in carrying out its private investigative work. After all, the power to conduct these proceedings in private, where appropriate, to determine whether sufficient evidence exists was a key part of the terms of reference given to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I want to quote the extracts I can give from a letter from the tribunal. The tribunal makes a number of points but I want to put some points on the record of the House. The letter states:</P>
    <P>The responsibility with which the Tribunal is charged is to ensure that matters within its Terms of Reference are ventilated so far as is practicable in a way which protects the constitutional rights of persons dealing with it. This the Tribunal does in the first instance by carrying out its initial investigatory work in private. Persons dealing with the Tribunal do so and expect to do so on the basis that the Tribunal will take steps to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable that confidentiality is maintained as regards information furnished by any such person to the Tribunal and also as regards any information made available by the Tribunal to any such person. The statement furnished by An Taoiseach clearly affects the interests of other persons. It would be irresponsible of the Tribunal to encourage any person dealing with it to think that circumstances you describe would justify the disclosure of such information in public otherwise than in the course of the Tribunal's sittings.</P>
    <P>The same applies to correspondence between any of your clients and the Tribunal, if there were a risk, as it seems to me that at least in general terms, there must be, that the disclosure of such correspondence could lead to the identification of persons dealing with the Tribunal in the course of the private phase of its work or could lead to the identification of or the disclosure of information furnished to the Tribunal by or in connection with any such person.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the foregoing there is an overriding consideration that persons dealing with the Tribunal should be able to do so in the confidence that the Tribunal will take every practical step to protect the confidentiality of any such person's dealings with the Tribunal during the private phase of its work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> The Tribunal would expect in particular that persons in a position of responsibility would not deviate from these principles. This is not to say that any person dealing with the Tribunal should be inhibited from so asserting, or from asserting that he had provided the Tribunal with a statement, [I have done so] or other information, to assist the Tribunal in its inquiries and that those inquiries are at a confidential stage.</P>
    <P>When I received that letter, it put me in a position where I could not give the correspondence or the details, other than what the Attorney General has stated. I wrote back to the tribunal, through solicitors for the Fianna Fáil Party who were dealing with this because it was a Fianna Fáil matter, and they asked if these matters should be made known to the House. I received a reply to that letter yesterday which states:</P>
    <P>In your letter you have indicated that the opposition parties in the Dail will be demanding a statement from An Taoiseach in relation to the Leaders Allowance. You have asked me to write to the Ceann Comhairle for the purpose of appraising him of the instructions and directions issued by the Tribunal to your client [that is to me]. I take it that your request is directed to me as Solicitor to the Tribunal and that what you require is that the Sole Member should write to An Ceann Comhairle in the terms indicated in your letter.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal's view is that while the situation, as described by you may cause difficulties for your clients, you must agree that your request effectively amounts to an invitation to the Tribunal to become embroiled in a political controversy. This could result in the Tribunal becoming identified with one side or other of a political controversy and is something which might lead to the compromising of the independence of the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>In particular it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to write to the Ceann Comhairle in circumstances which could be seen to amount to an attempt to influence the Ceann Comhairle in the way in which he exercises his powers or exercises any discretion in the discharge of the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>Lastly might I point out that the Tribunal has not given any directions to your client. Nor would the Tribunal presume to direct An Taoiseach or indeed any responsible office holder as to how they should act in relation to this matter. The Tribunal has already expressed the view that it would be confident that such directions would be unnecessary in the case of any responsible holder of public office. Indeed the Tribunal acknowledges the care with which your clients [me] appear to have observed the principles governing the operation of the Tribunal's workings, as outlined in my recent letters. In the same way the Tribunal has no reason to believe that any Ceann Comhairle or any other person holding a position of <Col N="526" /> responsibility would fail to have regard to the obligations of the Tribunal in carrying out its private investigatory work and the principles to be observed by persons dealing with the Tribunal in the course of this phase of the Tribunal's work.</P>
    <P>That is my position. That explains the matter and I have no more to say.</P>

I also want to put something on the record of the House, because this is a matter to which we would like to return. On 4 September 1997, Deputy Spring wrote to the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, seeking details of the allocation of the leader's allowance from 1983 to 1987 and from 1987 to 1991. In reply on 10 September, the Taoiseach pointedly referred to the period when Fianna Fáil was in Opposition, omitting to answer the second part of Deputy Spring's question. This is a day for putting matters on the record of the House and, for the benefit of members of the Fianna Fáil Party, I will quote their Taoiseach when, in respect of the allowance, he further stated:</P>
      <P>There was no surplus and no misappropriation. The person involved had sole control of the account. The money came in, the person lodged the cheque, dealt with the bills and invoices and paid those not covered by the ordinary allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to know what happened between 1987, when Fianna Fáil was in Opposition, and 1991 when apparently the Taoiseach became a signa<Col N="527" /> tory to the account and where misappropriation appears to have occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ireland has a rich tradition of mining extending back over 4,000 years and I am glad mineral extraction is still an important economic activity. In the modern era there have been many successful mineral developments which have benefited this country in terms of revenue and well paid employment. Many of these jobs have been created in relatively underdeveloped rural areas with little or no other employment.</P>
      <P>For a small country, we have been very successful in the discovery of mineral deposits which have resulted in a number of important mines currently in operation. Our geology holds out the promise of further economically viable mineral discoveries if we continue to encourage investment in exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Irish companies are active in this field, some of whom have made some of the most notable discoveries. However, junior exploration companies often need to form alliances with larger and more experienced partners to bring their discoveries to the next phase. It is important to encourage such partnerships with international <Col N="528" /> players who bring to this country the benefits of their worldwide experience and expertise in the most up to date methods of mining and environmental protection. We also welcome responsible international mining companies exploring in Ireland on their own behalf.</P>
    <P>When considering any country as a potential area for exploration, any major mining company will naturally be very interested in the geology and the track record of previous explorationists. There is no doubt that Ireland has its attractions in that regard. However, a less obvious but equally significant element in a company's decision to invest its exploration budget in a country is the stability of that country's political system, a clear set of laws and, in particular, confidence in the method of determining mineral rights ownership. It is essential for a potential investor to be assured that the system will allow it to obtain legal title to work the minerals it discovers. The Minerals Development Acts are intended to cater for this and have done so with various amendments since 1940.</P>
    <P>However, every system throws up complications from time to time and it is important that these are addressed when they arise, especially if they introduce uncertainty or delays. It is to deal with some such complications which have recently come to light during the processing of mining leases and licences that I have proposed this Bill. When enacted the Bill will remove some anomalies arising from the application of the Acts, particularly the position of some minerals vested in the Irish Land Commission. This is a technical measure which does not involve changes in policy and which has no adverse implications for anyone.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose in bringing forward this Bill is to deal with the question of certain mineral rights which were acquired by the Irish Land Commission by a variety of means. Section 2 is the relevant provision which is intended to amend the definition of State minerals in the Minerals Development Act, 1940. To give the background to this provision, I must explain certain aspects of mineral rights and ownership which are at the best of times complicated, even to those familiar with them.</P>
    <P>There are several categories of mineral rights which can be broken down into two essential classes &ndash; private minerals in private ownership and State minerals as defined in the Minerals Development Act, 1940. It is, and has been for a very long time, Government policy that all the State's mineral resources should be developed for the mutual benefit of the State and private developers. The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, provide the regulatory framework which enables the development of minerals, whether State-owned or privately owned. I must make clear that the range of minerals covered by these Acts does not include stone, sand, gravel or clay. Minerals in private ownership are covered by the <Col N="529" /> Minerals Development Act, 1979, to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>The 1940 Act deals with State-owned minerals. It empowers the Minister to issue State mining leases to those who discover economic deposits of State minerals. State minerals are defined in section 5 of that Act as:</P>
    <P>(a) any minerals and any exclusive mining right which, at the date of passing this Act, belong to or are the property of the State or the People, and are vested . in the State or in any Minister of State;</P>
    <P>(b) any minerals and any exclusive mining right which, on or after the passing of this Act become, by any means, the properly of or vested in the State or the People or become vested in a Minister of State, as on and from the date upon which they become such property or become so vested.</P>
    <P>Mineral rights were usually acquired by the State through dealings conducted by the Irish Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1903 and 1923. Other minerals and mining rights were vested in the Congested Districts Board and were acquired by the commission at the time of that board's dissolution under the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>It was normal practice that, whenever the Land Commission divided lands it had acquired on the break up of the big estates, or assisted tenants in direct purchase from landlords, the associated mineral rights were reserved by the commission. In the case of dealings under the 1923 Act, these mineral rights became vested in the State as provided for in that Act. However, where the dealings were done under the 1903 Act, the situation was different and more complicated.</P>
    <P>In 1931, the Mines and Minerals Act was passed which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that, from then on, minerals acquired by the commission under the 1903 Act would also become vested in the State. However, for acquisitions by the Land Commission under the 1903 Act which had taken place before 1931, and for Congested District Board acquisitions, the mineral rights remained vested in the commission rather than the State. It had always been assumed that all such mineral rights were also State minerals within the terms of the Minerals Development Act, 1940. Based on this assumption, successive Ministers have, in good faith, granted State mining leases under the 1940 Act which included these minerals.</P>
    <P>However, in the course of the investigation of mineral titles for the Lisheen mine, County Tipperary, it was brought to the attention of my Department that this assumption is likely to have been incorrect. The advice of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office was sought. Both agreed that, under the definition of State minerals as it stands in the 1940 Act, even though the Land Commission is an arm of the State, it should possibly have been regarded for mineral ownership purposes as a private body. This is the essence of the problem. This distinc<Col N="530" /> tion could call into question the power of the Minister to grant leases and cast doubt on the validity of leases already granted.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that the rights vested in the Irish Land Commission will be deemed to be, and to always have been, State minerals for the purposes of section 5(a) of the 1940 Act. This will mean that there can be no doubt that all minerals acquired by the Land Commission are State minerals and that all such leases granted by me or my predecessors will be valid.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the type of complication this situation can give rise to, I can give the example of the major new zinc and lead mine at Lisheen, north Tipperary. This deposit is being developed by Ivernia West, an Irish company, with its joint venture partner, Minorco. Minorco is part of the Anglo American Corporation, one of the largest and most successful mining conglomerates in the world. I was very pleased to grant a State mining lease to the companies in October 1997 but, before I could do so, extensive research had to be carried out into the question of who holds the mineral rights. As I have said, it was during the course of this title investigation that the question of the status of the Land Commission minerals came to light. It transpired that, while most of the minerals forming the Lisheen deposit were clearly State minerals within the meaning of the 1940 Act, a significant proportion was acquired by the Land Commission under the 1903 Act.</P>
    <P>Quite understandably, the two companies were interested in developing the whole deposit which they had found, having spent large amounts of money on exploration and land acquisition. They would not have been concerned with the subtle distinctions between State minerals and Land Commission minerals. The companies applied to the then Minister for a State mining lease over the orebody which, unknown to them, was a combination of 1903 Act and 1923 Act minerals. In examining the feasibility of the project, the applicants based all assumptions concerning the economics of the development on the entire deposit, as did my Department in its consideration of the project's viability. My Department had no reason to distinguish between 1903 Act and 1923 Act minerals since the received wisdom, until the legal advice was obtained, was that they were State minerals. Even though the 1903 Act minerals were not earmarked for immediate attention, they formed an important part of the overall reserves so the position needed to be regularised to give the companies involved full security.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I granted a State mining lease for the Lisheen mine in respect of all the minerals I could safely regard as State minerals, given the advice of the Attorney General's office. However, to satisfy the legitimate expectation of the developers that they would be able to mine the whole deposit as a unit, I built into the lease a commitment that it would be extended to include 1903 Act minerals if and when they became State minerals. On the advice of the Attorney General <Col N="531" /> I arranged for the drafting of this Bill in order to allow me to follow through on that commitment as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This issue also has implications for another major mineral extraction operation, namely the open cast pit of Irish Gypsum Limited at Knocknacran, County Monaghan. A consolidated lease is under negotiation between the company and my Department to give the operators continued rights of working, but parts of this deposit comprise 1903 Act minerals. These had been the subject of spent leases but I was precluded from granting a new lease over them because they were not technically State minerals. The Knocknacran deposit is the sole supplier for the plaster and plasterboard factory at Kingscourt, County Cavan, and it also provides essential materials for cement manufacture. Continued use of Irish raw materials for these essential components of construction depends on renewal of the company's access to this element of the deposit.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity the Bill provides to address two other issues which require attention. As I explained, while the Minerals Development Act, 1940, deals with minerals in State ownership, it is also in the national interest that minerals in private ownership be developed in an efficient and rational manner. A significant proportion of the mineral resources of the State are in private ownership. It would be impractical to have to make the distinction between State owned and privately owned minerals before undertaking an exploration programme, yet exploration companies need to know that a system exists to allow them to work whatever they find, subject to a proper development plan.</P>
    <P>For this reason, a system to regulate the working of privately owned minerals was established under the Minerals Development Act, 1979. It vested in the Minister with responsibility for mining the exclusive right to work all minerals in the State, with very few exceptions, and, consequently, the right to permit the working of those minerals by private individuals or companies. In keeping with the constitutional protection for the rights of private property, this was made subject to a right to compensation to the owners of the minerals at the time that any minerals were worked. Section 20 of the 1979 Act conferred this right to compensation on the person who had an estate or interest in the minerals on 20 June 1979. However, it also provided that this right could devolve and be disposed of. The effect of this was that the right to compensation became separated from the ownership of the minerals.</P>
    <P>Normal transactions of selling land rights can range from conveyance in full fee simple, where the buyer becomes the owner of everything from the centre of the Earth to the heavens, to simply granting a wayleave or easement, with several levels of transfer of rights in between. Therefore, it has been possible since 1979 for someone to sell land and minerals, or even just minerals, while <Col N="532" /> retaining the right to compensation for the working of the minerals. The purchaser would then own the minerals, but this would be of no value to him as the right to work them is vested in the Minister and the right to compensation is vested in the previous owner. This situation is patently absurd and one of which I am sure most buyers and sellers of land are not aware, since they are concerned mainly with the surface rights and not with the abstruse position underground about minerals which may or may not have any value.</P>
    <P>Matters become very complicated when I wish to grant a State mining licence for these minerals and it can result in long delays while the question of entitlement to mineral rights is sorted out. Under the procedures set out in the Minerals Development Act, 1979, I must give extensive public notice of my intention to permit the working of private minerals. I am also required to give direct notice to anyone who may appear to me to have an interest in the minerals to allow individuals an opportunity to establish their ownership. However, since the persons entitled to the compensation today are not necessarily the owners of either the minerals or of the land, they can be difficult to identify and may possibly be unaware of their entitlement. If nothing is done, the position will only become more difficult as the years pass.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with this problem. It will ensure that, in future, the right to compensation for the working of minerals under Section 20 of the 1979 Act cannot be separated from the ownership of the minerals and that, on any future sale or conveyance of the minerals, the right to compensation will also transfer automatically. This means that the right to compensation will vest in the owner of the minerals at the time they are developed or mined, except where a sale or conveyance, which separated the right to compensation from the ownership of minerals, has already taken place since 1979 and the owner of those minerals has not acquired the right to compensation.</P>
    <P>I am aware the problem remains for any land or mineral rights which may have been sold or disposed of between 1979 and now. I asked the Attorney General to consider making this provision retrospective but I am advised that it would be contradictory to the protection of the right to compensation contained in the Constitution. If land and mineral rights are sold in future following enactment of the Bill, the vendor could expect to obtain a price from the purchaser which would take account of the forgone compensation. That opportunity would not be available to previous vendors who have disposed of their mineral rights, and that in itself would be liable to compensation, so the problem would remain. Therefore, I must restrict this provision to future transactions but my Department will continue to consider ways to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with prosecutions for a variety of summary offences which are contained in the Minerals Development Acts. These make no pro<Col N="533" /> vision for who may prosecute, so it is left to the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring all such prosecutions. I have been advised by the Chief State Solicitor that, in line with other legislation, it would be more appropriate and more efficient administratively if relatively minor offences could be pursued in the District Court by the Minister or by the Mining Board as appropriate rather than involving the DPP. This is a simple technical amendment, with a consequent provision in section 5 relating to  expenses in bringing such cases.</P>
    <P>I sought the approval of my Cabinet colleagues to introduce the Bill now since the issues are uncontroversial and relatively simple to deal with, although the legal points are complex and abstruse, and there is nothing to gain by leaving matters as they are any longer, especially since the changes do not involve any departure from the policies adopted by successive Governments to date. In fact, there is a distinct advantage in administrative efficiency and in streamlining mineral ownership and rights to compensation for working minerals. However, I am aware of the need to examine the overall policy in this area and a fundamental review of minerals policy and regulatory practice in the minerals sector is under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>This process started with the examination of the industry in 1994 by the national minerals policy review group and its report was presented in April 1995. It had many valid points to make and a large range of recommendations, some of which have already been implemented. I see the report as a useful tool in assisting the formulation of policy. However, it can only be regarded as one input. While some recommendations have merit, others may not have been practical and others have been overtaken by changing circumstances, both fiscal and industrial. For example, the group recommended a corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for the industry. In the last budget a 25 per cent rate was announced for profits from mineral extraction, along with certain other categories of business, including non-trading income. However, the industry now sees the 12.5 per cent rate which will apply to the mainstream of business profits and, unsurprisingly, has reset its target. There are many arguments for and against the lower rate, not least of which is a package of favourable allowances which mining currently enjoys, and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has promised to keep the matter under review. However, I do not propose to discuss this matter in detail, merely to cite it as an example of the way policies and recommendations can be overtaken by events.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, following this policy review process, to bring forward more detailed legislative proposals within the next year. I hope these will address in a rational way many of the issues and outstanding recommendations contained in the report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group as well as many other issues my Department has examined in light of recent oper<Col N="534" /> ational experience. My aim will be to have a clear set of legislative proposals designed to cater for the needs of the State and the developers of our nation's mineral resources so that these resources can be responsibly and sensibly exploited for our mutual benefit well into the next millennium. For now, however. the Bill, when enacted, will clarify the position regarding minerals which are clearly in public ownership but technically were not vested in the State.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to Lisheen in County Tipperary and the commitment I gave to the joint holders of the State mining lease for that mine. Lisheen is a fine example of a modem mine development using best available technology. Before granting the lease I had to be satisfied that the project was robust, both commercially and physically, and that it was designed according to the highest environmental standards. The project underwent a rigorous examination by my Department with the help of external consultants of the highest international standing. This involved a detailed analysis of the project economics, ore reserve assumptions, development methods and costs, and a thorough examination of the environmental impact statement, with particular regard to closure planning. The project also required, and secured, planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency. As part of both processes, my Department was able to provide expert comments on the EIS and recommendations for conditions to be attached to both permits. This mine was a first for the EPA in that it was the first, not only in Ireland but in the European Union, to obtain an integrated pollution control licence.</P>
    <P>Public awareness of and access to the permitting processes is also essential so that local communities and the general public can be reassured that successful projects are designed and implemented to the highest environmental standards. This does not mean that there will not be objectors, but there is at least a forum for objections to be heard. This is in addition to whatever briefing and listening a potential developer engages in with neighbours and others likely to be affected by the proposal. Such dialogue must be an integral part of prudent project design because it can result in an optimal proposal to the best advantage of all concerned going into the formal permitting arena. I was encouraged to learn, therefore, that with the planning application for a project as large as Lisheen there were only six appeals to An Bord Pleanála. This is testament not only to the preparation by the developers but also to the quality of the planning decision.</P>
    <P>The Lisheen mine was designed to produce 1.5 million tonnes of ore per annum when fully operational. This level of output will support direct employment for more than 300 people. During development, however, up to 700 people will be employed on the project. As with any major employer in a rural region, there will be indirect <Col N="535" /> spin-off benefits resulting from the spending power of the mine, and its employees, which will support the local economy and generate further employment. Production of zinc and lead concentrates is due to commence by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Lisheen is the second major mine to be developed in recent years. In neighbouring County Kilkenny, there is a smaller but still significant zinc and lead mine at Galmoy. This mine, operated by an Irish company, Arcon Mines Limited, was granted a State mining licence in 1995 and is now in full production, providing employment for more than 200 people. Galmoy was the first new base metal mine in Ireland since Tara began operations in the 1970s. I granted two State mining licences to Tara in 1998 to work private minerals adjacent to the existing lease area outside Navan. Tara is the largest zinc and lead mine in Europe and the new licences will help to ensure that it will continue in production for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Along with other natural resources, our mineral deposits are an important national asset and there is great potential for further discoveries. My aim is to ensure that deposits of minerals continue to be found and developed in a responsible way, for the mutual benefit of the nation and private investors. I place considerable emphasis on the word responsible because we must ensure that these activities are undertaken with particular regard to environmental protection. Our system of environmental checks and balances is intended to ensure that this is the case and we have led the way in Europe with our integrated pollution control licence system.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that exploration and mining are undertaken with due sensitivity to the needs of local communities. Miners have to be good neighbours and must make a positive contribution to counterbalance the right to deplete a finite resource. This can be done in many ways, including payment of royalties and taxes to the State, contributions towards infrastructure and indeed job creation. In supporting responsible exploration and development we can have a mining industry which can be to the benefit of both the developers and the State as a whole and in this way mining can be made compatible with the principles of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>To foster further exploration we need to maximise inward investment in the minerals exploration sector in tandem with investing in indigenous exploration and service companies. This puts us in direct competition with other countries with similar if not better geological conditions, all trying to persuade explorationists to invest their limited exploration budgets. Many of these countries, which used to be hostile to foreign companies developing their mineral resources, are now actively seeking such investment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has done well against this background in attracting a good share of exploration investment. This is due in no small measure to the success of Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen. The geology <Col N="536" /> here holds out the possibility of further discoveries and all three of our major base metal mines have increased their identified reserves through extensive exploration programmes. To continue to support this activity it is essential to have a rational legislative framework to regulate the industry.</P>
    <P>The legislative measures contained in the Bill are part of an ongoing effort to keep legislation and practices in the minerals sector up to date and relevant to the modern industry. The particular issues addressed require urgent clarification and I, therefore, recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that the mining industry currently enjoys a package of favourable allowances. It has been pointed out by outside observers that the 1992 licensing terms and agreement, concluded under Ray Burke and Deputy Molloy, appeared to contain a number of very favourable recommendations. However, we have matured a great deal in terms of how we deal with the mining industry. For example, let us contrast Lisheen with the old mine situated at Tynagh near Loughrea. Everyone is aware that the development at Tynagh left behind an ugly scar on the landscape. However, in light of the safety mechanisms we have put in place to protect the environment, we have advanced by leaps and bounds.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Bill is designed to close off various monopolies. Companies such as Lisheen Mines would not like to leave any open-ended sites, particularly in view of the terms set out in mining leases, and the legislation is important in that regard. People have one major disappointment in respect of the mining licence the Minister granted to Lisheen Mines in 1997 and we can learn from this in the future. I refer here to the planning process. Lisheen is a classic example of a mine situated in a rural location with access to a railway line six to seven miles away. Material from the mine could have been transported to Lisduff quarry or Thurles and shipped from there by rail to the relevant port. Instead, about 40 juggernauts will travel back and forth in heavy traffic through Cork city.</P>
      <P>About 99 per cent of freight in our ports is transported by road. There should be a policy to transport some goods by rail. This is an opportunity where, with goodwill and enthusiasm, freight could be transported by rail. It would be a much better mode of transportation. Recently, economic consultants, DKM, looked at CIE and Iarnród Éireann, the freight and passenger aspects, and made recommendations accordingly. Their concerns focused mainly on the freight aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little encouragement could have steered it in that direction. The company has £4 million earmarked for roads development. This is not a vast sum. It should have been instructed that freight was to be delivered by rail. We have a track record in this area. It is easy for me to advance <Col N="537" /> the cause of Foynes because I am from there. For 26 years Magcobar exported ore from County Tipperary and it travelled on a rail link through Foynes very effectively. Mogul did it for about 15 years. Therefore, the precedent was already established.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the traffic volumes on our roads and the projections up to 2010 will put even further pressure on them. That is the reason I regret that in the recent mining lease and in the planning application it was not stipulated that rail should be used. It was a classic example of where it could be used. I wish Lisheen mine well. There is also involvement from Ivernia West and Anglo American, which is probably one of the largest exploration companies in the world. An environmental impact assessment was carried out and an integrated pollution licence obtained &ndash; everything was done correctly. A sum of money has been provided for restoration purposes when the mine closes eventually. A mistake was made in the past when ugly scars were left. In many cases people are looking to an alternative use for them, probably looking to landfill developments. This creates problems in areas where open-cast mining took place. Let us hope the lead and zinc concentrates will be in production at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Galmoy exports through New Ross, which is not a considerable distance from the mine. All this is done in the backdrop where concentrates, such as ore and zinc, are not fetching a premium price in the commodity markets. Not long ago, during its economic difficulties, Tara mines had to introduce certain production efficiencies to make its product more attractive on a tonnage basis to enable it thrive in the marketplace. Tara is a modern mine. I am glad economies have been effected there. I hope Tara will go from success to success as it is one of the largest mines in the world. I referred earlier to Tynagh but I think it better to leave that history behind us. We have progressed with regard to mining activities in recent times.</P>
    <P>While the Bill concentrates on mineral resources, it would be remiss of me not to speak about offshore oil activity etc. The world price for crude oil is low and the Minister was probably disappointed last March when he announced that out of 155 blocks for exploration activity in the Porcupine Basin only 11 were taken up by two companies. Given that crude oil prices are low, there is not enough buoyancy in that activity for exploration companies to decide to drill. In 1977 I recall reading a banner headline, &ldquo;Oil struck off the Porcupine&rdquo;. We are still waiting for the oil to come on shore. I remember clearly the headlines and the excitement that pursued. Obviously it was uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to what is taking place off the Slyne Trough and the Mayo coastline with regard to the offshore oil exploration taking place there. In a recent statement the Minister said the flow was showing up to 1 trillion cubic feet of gas. That was disputed in a national newspaper afterwards &ndash; it was even more optimistic and mentioned 5 <Col N="538" /> trillion cubic feet of gas. I understand the Minister cannot be over-zealous in making such statements because one has to be concerned with regard to the impact on shares. It is well known from people involved on the fringes of offshore oil activity that there is much excitement with regard to what is happening off the Slyne Trough. In 1996 the first drilling activity took place there and a well was sunk. In 1997 no wells were drilled. In 1998 there was an optimism following the company's return.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my disappointment many times at what has happened. I accept the Minister's assurance that under EU law he cannot compel any company to take on Irish workers. On many occasions when I raised questions voicing my concerns, I was given optimistic answers, probably to fob me off, that discussions were taking place between the different interests and the offshore operators association to seek some effective conclusions with SIPTU. I recognise those discussions were going nowhere because the main player, Enterprise Oil, was not interested in involving itself in such discussions.</P>
    <P>I was particularly disappointed when a service contract, which is a lucrative contract for any commercial port, was lost to Foynes in 1998 as a result of a picket by frustrated SIPTU workers who traditionally got work on the rigs. For the first time ever as a result of a fully manned rig arriving they were unable to get work on the rigs and exercised their frustration. Unfortunately, that frustration was taken out in the commercial port of Foynes. It is possible that it left a sour taste with regard to other potential uses of Foynes and the fear of hostile relations in that area. I regret that and I expressed the view that Foynes was used as a cockpit for a national dispute. That is history now. Enterprise Oil sailed off to Ayr in Scotland which has the service contract. I understand it is leaving the contract there this year and will be using Killybegs on an emergency basis when it suits. It was unfortunate that that situation developed.</P>
    <P>When the gas comes ashore I hope the economies of County Mayo and the State will benefit. Many people are watching with great anxiety developments in that regard. We are all aware that the Marathon gas find in Ballycotton and Kinsale has a finite life and in the past 20 years produced about 30 per cent of our gas. An alternative company will be needed to replace it in the near future or, alternatively, to provide a continuous stream of gas. In my own area, Aughinish Alumina was recently bought by Glencore. They hope that, over time, they will get a chance to use natural gas. To date, a company of that size is barred from using natural gas because it would probably speed up the depletion of the finite resource in Kinsale, which is understandable. I wish the company well. The Swiss commodities company which took it over will give the firm added value and advantages with regard to buying raw materials which are important for the production of aluminium there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> I mentioned the rail lines earlier and it would be remiss of me not to mention an issue which will impact on the commercial port of Foynes and industry along the corridor from Limerick to Foynes. The Minister recently travelled the N69 route, which could be made legendary in a song at this stage. This road is extremely dangerous, although it is the secondary route with the highest volume of heavy goods vehicles. It is most regrettable that this road was not included in the operational programme 1994-9 as requiring urgent remedial work. Each year a sum of £0.5 million is allocated, but this only enables work to be carried out on a small section of the road. Recently a convoy of heavy good vehicles blocked the road for a considerable amount of time, but this was symptomatic of the frustration of the people who use it.</P>
    <P>Much money has been spent on developing the port, but its business will be retarded unless something is done about the route. Some £15 million to £20 million is required and I hope priority status will be given to work on this road in the next operational programme. Out of frustration, a colleague of mine, councillor David Naughton, suggested recently at a council meeting that if the National Roads Authority said it would fund the interest on a loan, this money should be raised. His proposal was accepted by councillors and the county manager. Urgent action is needed. Work on a large water scheme along that route compounded the dangers associated with it.</P>
    <P>Over many years, the Shannon Estuary project team has considered what type of industry could be attracted to the area. The estuary has been described as the jewel in the western crown. However, its potential has not been fully recognised. The Shannon Estuary project team said it would be extremely important that one could travel from Limerick to Tarbert in an hour. However, it would take at least 30 minutes to travel 20 miles. This is not sustainable and it is regrettable that something has not been done about it, especially in terms of the type of industry which exists along the route and any development which may take place in the future in a large industrial park in Askeaton.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion the Minister said that a decision on whether a company used rail rather than road is a matter for the company itself and he could not interfere. However, a provision should be included in the planning process in the future to encourage companies to use rail. This would be in the long-term interest of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that sand and gravel is exempt from the Bill. Sand and gravel appear to be finite resources and there is difficulty extracting them in certain areas. This trend was disturbed recently; the Minister is probably aware of this issue following the case involving the codling bank off Dunmore East. Some areas are turning to the sea bed to extract sand and gravel. The Minister is aware of the reaction of the fish<Col N="540" /> ermen in Howth, Skerries and elsewhere to the idea of 0.25 million tonnes of sand and gravel being extracted from the codling bank. The Minister said it was such a small area that it would not make any difference to the sea bed and the habitat of the fish. However, this has not allayed concerns and the trend is increasing. There is extreme pressure to catch fish within the 12 mile limit at present and this development will create its own pressures in the future if it continues.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain on Committee Stage why the geological aspect is the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise. It is an integral feature of mining policy and I do not understand why it has not been transferred to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, which appears to be the logical place for it.</P>
    <P>The developments of recent years are desirable. The maturity with regard to mining is welcome, but the sector must be copperfastened for the future. The planning conditions must be strengthened in terms of the use of road or rail. It is not in the ultimate interest of ports and roads to have practically all traffic using the roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the position with regard to the fishing quotas and that trawlers have been encouraged to fish non-quota species. However, in a classic example recently, an embargo was placed on the fishing of the non-quota species of blue whiting. Other countries continued fishing the species while our fishermen, who in the main operate from Killybegs, sat in port watching them. The natural response was to complain to Commissioner Bonino and hope she took action. What action is taken against countries which continue to fish non-quota species? Are any restrictions or fines placed on them? Irish fishermen got the wrong end of the deal in terms of the allocation of the original quotas and we have paid the price recently. I applaud the Minister on his achievements with regard to new vessels, but part of the conditions attached was that they would fish for non-quota species. To where will they turn? What will happen if they opt for a non-quota species such as blue whiting and somebody says subsequently that they must stop fishing it? There lies a contradiction and I understand the fishermen's frustration about recent events.</P>
    <P>This mirrors the frustration in recent years with regard to new non-quota species, such as horse mackerel, which became quota species. The feeling is that Ireland did not get a proper quota when they were being allocated. I do not understand how Austria, which does not have a navy or a trawler, can hold discussions each December under the common fisheries policy about the allocation of quotas to different countries. What is in it for Austria? It horse trades with other European countries to achieve concessions in other areas. However, they do not think of Ireland when they make such decisions. This concerns me with regard to Irish fishermen and the frustration they experience about the types of fish they want <Col N="541" /> to catch in the future.

      <P>I compliment you on your tolerance, a Cheann Comhairle. I ask the Minister to consider, before Committee Stage, my views on how ore is transported. We should try to legislate to ensure that if a rail link exists within a reasonable distance from a mine, it is used. I have no quibbles with the Bill which is an important amendment to the law. When Lisheen obtained a mining lease and sought a legal lease, certain anomalies were found. It is important that we address those anomalies in legislation such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Finucane, about transport from mines. The rail link from the Navan mine to Dublin is <i>via </i>Drogheda and one can imagine the chaos and damage which would be caused should the ore be transported by road rather than rail through Drogheda or County Meath because many roads in those areas are chock-a-block with traffic at present. This issue should be examined in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>I do not know what rail connections are in place for the mines in Counties Kilkenny and Tipperary or the intended means of transport but if the ore is to be transported by road the rail option should have been seriously examined. It is probably not possible to make rail transportation of ore compulsory for mining companies if the facilities are not available but such transport would mean great savings in the repair and upkeep of roads and would also create much needed revenue for our national transport company. Perhaps the Minister might give us his thoughts on that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party acknowledges the need for this Bill to deal with a number of anomalies <Col N="542" /> which have arisen regarding the ownership of mineral rights, particularly those vested in the Land Commission. Mineral exploration and the development of mines is a hugely expensive operation and companies will not commit the necessary level of investment unless there is absolute certainty about the legal title to the minerals they want to develop. This Bill will remove the uncertainty and make clear that mineral rights vested in the Land Commission are the property of the State. These are, therefore, State minerals for which the State can issue mining licences.</P>
    <P>Under section 2, the provisions of the Bill are backdated to 1940, a period of almost 60 years. This must be a legislative record. Many Deputies will recall that whenever they sought to backdate a provision, Ministers always had a list of reasons for not doing so &ndash; constitutional reasons, legal arguments, cost implications, etc. When it comes to meeting the needs of multinational companies, the Government adopts a much more flexible approach. This has been the case with successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Generations of Irish children were taught that Ireland was a poor country with few or no natural resources. We now know this is far from being the case. We have the biggest lead and zinc mine in Europe and some of the most significant such deposits in the world. However, we can legitimately ask whether we have made the best use of these great natural resources since we first began to develop them in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>Coming from a neighbouring county, I know Tara Mines has been a valuable source of employment for more than two decades, not only for the people of County Meath but for people from County Louth and other adjoining counties. More than 600 people are employed there currently. The mine has not been without problems in the past few months, as the Minister knows. Industrial relations difficulties have arisen because of attempts by management to cut costs. I pay tribute to my colleagues in SIPTU and the engineering unions who have a difficult task there and have been closely associated with the discussions. I thank them for their contribution to resolving the difficult problems which could have led to the closure of the mine, arising from a serious fall in the concentration of zinc. Tara Mines is the key element in the economic system of the north-east and we must hope these difficulties are sorted out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Significant new reserves of ore have been discovered in the past decade. The Arcan mine at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, came on stream in 1997 and the Lisheen mine in County Tipperary, which is expected to be even bigger than Arcan, is due to commence at the end of this year. This project provided about 600 jobs during construction and is likely to provide in the region of 300 permanent jobs.</P>
    <P>There will be a great boost to the economy of those areas but there is still a question as to whether the country has received the best return from our natural resources. Return to the State <Col N="543" /> comes in a number of ways &ndash; directly, through royalties and taxation paid by mining companies and indirectly, through wages and the boost to the local economy. There is no doubt that the original mining lease given to Tara Mines in the 1970s was an error of judgment, in that it based the royalties payable to the State on profits assessed on corporation tax. Given how our corporation tax system was then structured, Tara was able to avoid paying any corporation tax for the first 10 years of its operation and, thus, paid no royalties to the State, despite exporting lead and zinc concentrates with a value of hundreds of millions of pounds. It would be more logical to have a royalty payable on every tonne of ore extracted from the ground.</P>
    <P>I understand that the leases granted in respect of Galmoy and Lisheen at least seek to address this problem by assessing the royalty payable on a percentage of turnover. Perhaps the Minister will confirm this and indicate how much the State expects to take in royalties over the lifetimes of these two mines. I am sure the Department has researched this and that the Department of Finance has an interest in it. It would be wrong for the country to lose millions of pounds by making the same mistake made in the case of Tara Mines.</P>
    <P>The other question that arises is whether the country would have been better served by trying to process the ore rather than simply exporting it in its raw state. Exporting ore is the same as exporting cattle on the hoof, which I fought against for a long time during my trade union career. There is no added value to the economy. According to the report of the national minerals policy review group, Ireland exported approximately 350,000 tonnes of zinc ore each year during the 1980s with an average value of more than £100 million.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the serious environmental issues that arise with regard to a smelter, it is an issue which should be considered again. There are a number of major mines and, hopefully, many more will come on stream in the future. Environmental standards are higher and procedures are more vigorous than when the issue was examined previously. The IDA drew up plans for a smelter in the 1970s but they were not developed. Given that two major mines are coming on stream, it is worth examining the matter again with a view to getting added value, without damaging our environment, from the ore currently being produced and exported to countries such as Belgium.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge the tremendous role played by those who work in the mines. One often hears discussions about the environmental and other problems associated with mines but few people are aware of the difficult working conditions for those working in mines. I wish to put my thanks to them on record. Irrespective of the origin of the company or where the ore is sent, it cannot go anywhere without the labour of the men and women who work in the mines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> The Labour Party welcomes this Bill and hopes it gets a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes this Bill. It is well known that rights such as fishing rights, shooting rights and mineral rights were attached to certain estates. This led to a great deal of controversy over the years. In some cases, despite the Minister's earlier remarks, mineral rights are still held by some estates and would not have been transferred if there were no dealings under the Acts to which the Minister referred. This should be investigated.</P>
      <P>The rights of individual owners of land on which minerals might exist or be found must be given full consideration. The Bill vests these rights in the State but it does not provide for any compensation for the landowners. I do not know what redress they might have with regard to the compensation to which they believe they might be entitled. In the case of coalmines, there were continuous rows regarding rights to underground coal resources. They occurred in my constituency where various people claimed rights to the same portion of coal reserves. This matter should be clarified in Bills such as this.</P>
      <P>Everybody supports the development of the country's natural resources. They are the State's assets and the State has a duty to ensure that maximum use is made of such assets on behalf of its citizens. I agree with Deputy Bell that the royalties which should apply deserve close scrutiny in the context of the leases issued by the State. In previous years, questions were raised about the royalties sought by the State. There should be a system to make the royalty proposals known to the public for a certain amount of time prior to them being agreed. People therefore, would have the right to comment on them if they believed it to be warranted. It is unfair to the taxpayer to give away a natural resource for little or no return to the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane spoke about the problems which arise with the extraction of ore. Even if it is something as small as a quarry or gravel pit, one sees the effect it can have on roads and other infrastructure in an area. His suggestion that rail lines should be used to transport the minerals from the mines is worthy of consideration. Major damage can be done to roads, bridges and other infrastructural elements by the transportation of heavy loads of ore when the roads are not suitable for carrying such loads over a long period.</P>
      <P>Indeed, in the planning process, local authorities should be asked to examine this aspect with regard to the charges they might impose for the damage done to roads as a result of transporting ore deposits. In many instances, the local authorities must pick up the bill for the damage but they receive no income. This issue must be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Bell's comments on the Navan mine. I would not like to contemplate the possible condition of the road from Navan to Drogheda if there had not been a rail line to <Col N="545" /> transport the ore. The amount of investment both Louth and Meath County Councils would have been obliged to make would have been far beyond their resources and they would have received no return, aside from the creation of a certain number of jobs. Everybody appreciates the creation of jobs but the overall return to the community would have been a minus. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>State involvement is a major issue and will increase in the future if gas and oil fields are discovered off the coast. What royalties will the State seek? I accept that nobody will develop these fields without the benefit of financially rewarding incentives. The multinationals are international concerns and their only interest is the bottom line in terms of what can be got from the deal. However, we have a duty to future generations to ensure we do not give away these rights and royalties at too low a value. This must be considered when licence agreements are put in place.</P>
    <P>People expect development. They do not want to see natural resources left lying in the ground for eternity. There comes a time when we must decide whether it is more beneficial to develop a mine or leave it undeveloped as it may have a greater value at a later date. As there is State involvement in mining, royalties should be published prior to licences being agreed to allow people to comment on them if they consider there is a need to do so.</P>
    <P>Coal was a major source of employment up to recently in the part of the country from where I come. Good employment, although it was scarce, was found in coalmines, but they are no longer in operation and the legacy of health problems suffered by some individuals who worked in them is being picked up by the State. That is not due to any action taken by mine owners who tried to look after their workers as much as possible. The technology available in the mining industry 30 or 40 years ago was a carbide lamp, a pick and coal hutch. Workers tried to pick as much coal as possible during their shifts to earn a decent salary and they did not consider the health problems they might suffer later. Consideration should be given to protecting the health of those who will be involved in future mining operations. The Minister, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, should examine what can be done to ensure such workers' health will be protected in the short and long-term.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Kinsale gas field is nearing the end of its lifespan. It is believed there are other gas fields, some onshore and others offshore. The Minister and his Department should endeavour to see what can be done to ensure these come onstream to fill the vacuum that will be left with the running down of the Kinsale gas field.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to examine the possibility of widening the natural gas grid. A connection to <Col N="546" /> Sligo, Longford and Mullingar has been sought long since, but there has not been any action on it. That should be examined. Access to gas is a major infrastructural boost to an area in terms of its development and the attraction of foreign industry.</P>
    <P>While a number of licences have been issued, a time limit should apply to all future licences. If deposits found are not developed, the developers should not be able to retain the licences indefinitely, as happened on occasions in the past. Exploration licences should be granted for a maximum period of three to five years. That would ensure mineral finds that are economic would not be left undeveloped indefinitely or that developers would not take any action to ensure they are developed.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members who live close to the Border would be concerned about rights in regard to a cross-Border gas find. It has been suggested there is gas on the Femanagh-Cavan-Leitrim Border area. What would be the position with regard to the right to explore such a gas field <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland and this side of the Border? That matter should be examined. There have been small gas finds in that area over the past 30 years and some of them have been plugged and not explored.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm whether we can ensure that the benefits that accrue from the service of offshore rigs accrue to companies within the State? Recently a rig off the west coast was serviced by a company from outside the State. We should examine this matter with a view to making it a condition, where possible, that the service of offshore rigs should be undertaken by companies within the State. I do not want to make life awkward for those who draw up licence agreements, but as much benefit as possible from the servicing of offshore rigs should accrue to the State. The development of our natural resources would generate employment, but there is also an onus on us as legislators to ensure that the maximum benefit possible accrues to the State from the servicing of offshore rigs. Such benefit would accrue in terms of revenue and employment, which is imperative for the economy.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to clarify the position where ownership of minerals is not covered by the 1940 Act, the Land Commission Act or the 1923 Act. The issue of where minerals are not held by the State has arisen in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>The payment of compensation in respect of lands under which mineral resources may be found must be examined. It would be unfair if a family, who may have owned land under which there is a natural resource prior to any of these Acts coming into force, were stripped of that asset, irrespective of whether they knew that natural resource was under the land. That matter should be examined. The possibility of establishing a system of arbitration to deal with such cases should also be examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> We all welcome this opportunity to progress our mining industry. This legislation is necessary as a result of what has happened at Lisheen mine and the Minister said he hopes to introduce another minerals Bill in the not too distant future. We must maximise the benefit accruing from the mining industry to the taxpayers, who have put in place a good deal of the infrastructure that will be used to develop these resources. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the royalties that will accrue to the State and the people from future mining operations will be announced prior to final agreement being reached on future licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. I come from an area where mining has been a vital source of employment throughout the past decades of this century. Irish Gypsum and Tara Mines are two of the biggest sources of employment in the area I represent. The economy of north Meath has benefited greatly from the proximity of these two mining resources. Irish Gypsum Limited operates a major gypsum open cast pit in County Monaghan. From here gypsum is supplied to Gypsum Industries at Kingscourt on the Meath-Cavan border.</P>
      <P>The construction industry is heavily dependent on the plasterboard produced here. As a result, Gypsum Industries is a major employer in the area and has provided a lifeline to local communities. This is an area where farms are small and land is of very poor quality. The &ldquo;gyp&rdquo;, as it is referred to locally, has enabled farmers to remain in the area and provided a substantial boost to their incomes. The future for schools and businesses throughout the area would have been very bleak without this major industry.</P>
      <P>Tara Mines started production at Navan in the mid-1970s. This was a major boost not only for the town of Navan but also for Kells and north Meath. The success of Tara Mines over the years has been remarkable. It has a good environmental history and an open door policy at its environmental office. The company is to be commended on its success in staff agreement negotiations. This has resulted in a profitable operation despite a continuing low world market price for zinc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just quoted two examples of the positive contribution the nation's mineral resources can make to an area. The product of these industries is transported by rail to port. County Meath is lucky to have a railway line from Kingscourt to Navan and on to Drogheda port, which saves our road network greatly. The extension of the gas network to parts of County Meath in recent years is welcome. I would like the Minister to consider the extension of the gas line to other parts of <Col N="548" /> County Meath, particularly rural towns and north Meath as this would attract industry there.</P>
    <P>The chief purpose of this Bill is to address the question of mineral rights, as outlined by the Minister. There is some uncertainty in this regard. The Bill will also address the right to compensation under the Minerals Development Act, 1997. The current position could leave minerals owners without any rights. It is also difficult, if not impossible, to identify the owner of the right to compensation. This Bill will address that problem by providing that where any sale or convenience takes place involving mineral rights, the right to compensation will automatically transfer with them.</P>
    <P>It is important that exploration continues throughout the country. Further discoveries can be made and several new companies have been attracted to explore here in the face of strong competition from other countries. Other areas will then reap the benefits which will ensue from having a successful mining industry. The country will benefit from increased tax revenue from royalties, rents and prospective licensing. This country offers attractive investment opportunities. These will secure the future of this industry. I compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution on this important Bill. As the Minister said, its principal purpose is to deal with certain mineral rights acquired by the Irish Land Commission by a variety of means. I welcome the Minister's commitment to the introduction of further legislation following the policy review process. I look forward to the Minister bringing forward those legislative measures in the next year.</P>
      <P>Like you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Brady, we in the Cavan, Monaghan and Meath areas are conscious of the substantial employment provided in the Kingscourt area since 1936 by the mining and subsequent processing of gypsum deposits. Great credit is due to the Creedon family and Mr. Michael Creedon, who established gypsum operations in Kingscourt in 1936. This operation started with a total workforce of six men. The first mine to be developed was at Lisnabo. Today in excess of 200 people are employed by Gypsum Industries. From 1989-91 it invested heavily in the development of the new Knocknacran mill in County Monaghan and the new board plant at the factory premises at Kingscourt. This overall investment amounted to about £20 million. In the past two years the company has invested in the region of £10 million in its plant facilities at Kingscourt. As Deputy Brady said, the company provides great employment for three counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company involves itself in the local community and provides excellent employment. It has been a major employer of generations of families in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath. It started off in 1936 as a small plaster company. At present its <Col N="549" /> plasterboard facilities manufacture products of the highest standard. The recent welcome growth in the construction sector has obviously added to the demand for the product. Unfortunately for some years there was a growth in imports of plasterboard and related products. I hope it will be possible to further develop our industry and reduce the level of imports.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the gypsum deposits at Glangevlin in north-west Cavan &ndash; Kingscourt is in east Cavan. For some years there was exploration for gas in the Glangevlin, Dowra and Blacklion areas. Apparently the gas finds were not of sufficient quantity to warrant further exploration. In 1992 a detailed technical report was drawn up. This included an estimate of the resources of gypsum deposit in Glangevlin and concluded there was at least 15 million tonnes of a gypsum resource in that area and at least six million tonnes were minable gypsum reserves. That report included the estimate of the resources in the deposit and showed it was likely to be physically possible to extract a substantial tonnage of gypsum. The report also showed the Glangevlin deposit was sufficiently economically attractive to warrant further more detailed exploration work.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the then Department of Transport, Energy and Communications invited people to apply for prospecting licences over that major gypsum deposit. At that time the Department outlined that while preliminary drilling and other studies in the area over the years identified a gypsum resource of at least 15 million tonnes and minable gypsum reserves of at least six million tonnes, the full character, extent and value of the gypsum deposit had yet to be established. Subsequently, a prospecting licence was issued. It was hoped that with the substantial work and studies carried out in previous years that the work programme for that particular licence would be of a shorter duration than the usual prospecting licence. I do not expect the Minister to have answers to the queries I am putting to him. However, I hope he and his Department will ensure the studies on the prospecting licence will be finalised as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, the Glangevlin, Blacklion and Dowra areas have suffered great depopulation and a lack of employment opportunities over the years. People in County Cavan are very anxious for the deposits of gypsum there to be extracted and processed locally to generate employment for the local community.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I tabled a parliamentary question, which was replied to by the then Fine Gael Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry. I asked him if the Department would ensure that, if the gypsum deposits were commercial, all efforts would be made to ensure they were processed locally. I was most disappointed by his reply, which read:</P>
    <P>While I would be anxious that local employment should be maximised, this will be a matter for the ultimate developer. I will have no con<Col N="550" /> trol over whether he wishes to process it on site, within the State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That gave a very bad impression and the wrong answer to the community which wants the natural resources which belong to this State extracted and processed locally, which would provide employment for the local community. I hope the Minister, under this or future legislation, will ensure local communities can derive the benefits from the extraction of natural resources in their area. I hope the Minister and his Department will insist the prospecting licence studies are completed as rapidly as possible. It is hoped those studies will demonstrate that the deposits are commercial and can be extracted and processed locally, which will generate much needed employment in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting debate on the State's mineral rights and the manner in which they have developed. I was particularly interested in the Minister's speech. It is not very long ago that it was fashionable to say the State had virtually no mineral resources. When I was a schoolboy it was said that Ireland was not blessed with many mineral resources of any kind. When one studied the economic development of neighbouring states, the effects of the industrial revolution and the ready availability of coal and iron ore, it was always clearly stated that this country did not have similar resources. Perhaps we did not have those minerals, but we have realised since then that we have substantial mineral resources.</P>
      <P>I got the impression from the Minister's speech that the 1940 Act was the first legislation dealing with this issue. It is understandable that the rights vested in the State, the Land Commission and various bodies under the Land Acts would have been assumed to be State rights at all times in the interim. However, in this era of increased litigation, the Minister is right to address these issues now that they have come to light.</P>
      <P>When I was a young teacher working near Loughrea in County Galway the Tynagh mines were being worked very actively. I came from a rural area 40 or 50 miles away, which was very similar in many respects. However, I was struck by the huge impact of the activity at Tynagh on the economic life of the area. In the early to mid 1970s Loughrea was a booming town. It did not have a huge industrial base but was a dormitory town for many people from all over the country and the world who were working in Tynagh mines at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often thought since then about the relatively lax control regime in operation at that time, which was not several centuries ago, rather it was less than a generation ago. Some of the minerals being extracted, which included lead, were quite dangerous. There was a scheme under which householders in the immediate area of the mine were provided with milk and vegetables from outside by the mining company. The mind boggles at the kind of legal difficulties the company would <Col N="551" /> have to surmount to operate a similar system today. To the best of my knowledge, and I have maintained close relations with many friends in that area, there was never a great epidemic or any suggestion that anyone suffered as a result of the mining activity, about which we are all delighted. However, there would be a very different approach to such mining and those materials today.</P>
    <P>This puts me in mind of the position in Kilbricken, County Clare, which is between Ennis and Quin, where there are very strong local objections to an extraction proposal. In the absence of any strong evidence to the contrary, I support strongly the concerns and objections of the local community. I would not have been satisfied by the undertakings and guarantees available to them. The evidence suggests we will encounter this increasingly in the future because the deposits there may offer the kind of opportunities for employment and development which my colleagues have been talking about. Given the level of local opposition in that small community, it seems it would be impossible to proceed with the development of any mineral resources there. It seems these activities are no longer, if they ever were, welcome in an area and they are open to a good deal of questioning. It ought to be possible to provide the answers to what seem to me to be very reasonable questions. For many people, mining &ndash; or any other form of benefiting from the State's mineral resources &ndash; is something of a dirty word.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a need to encourage exploration and to ensure people who believe resources might exist have the legal framework and guarantees they require to proceed. However, at the stage when one wants to extract the minerals and see an economic benefit flowing from the available resources it is much more difficult and important to encourage acceptance of the necessary operations. I do not know how that will be done, but the issue of non-acceptability provides the greatest barrier to progress in this sector.</P>
    <P>Recently, I passed signs on at least two stretches of road where locals are objecting to a proposed quarry. Quarrying has now been added to the list of undesirable activities. It used to be travellers' halting sites, dumps, landfill sites and, in some particularly daft areas, tourist visitor centres. The latter are generally only objected to by outsiders but the objections to the others generally come from people in the immediate locality. There seems to be a growing number of activities which generate a great amount of local opposition at an early developmental stage. Unless this is addressed, any type of exploration will become virtually impossible in areas where people are prepared to mount a campaign of opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to junior or less well-off exploration companies, which are likely to be indigenous Irish companies, and the need for <Col N="552" /> them to set up international alliances in order to proceed with extracting minerals. I am pleased the Minister has seen fit to introduce clear legal guidelines to address the difficulties which arose in the recent past. I compliment him and I know he will be thorough in addressing the problems which have arisen.</P>
    <P>The Minerals Development Act, 1940, to which I have referred, appears to refer to State-owned minerals. These State rights appear to arise mainly from various Land Acts from a very different era. Sometimes these rights were not vested in the State but in the Land Commission or the local authority of the time. The State sometimes granted mineral leases in cases where it did not have the right to do so &ndash; Lisheen is a case in point. If this were the legal position with which exploration companies had to contend, they would go elsewhere and whatever resources lie untapped would remain so. For this reason I welcome the legislation which is likely to result in considerable development.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to my previous point about the fundamental conflict in almost every scenario between development and the environment and between development and the local community, which is manifest in housing. It has been suggested that 35,000 or 40,000 new housing units per annum are needed. If it is decided to build these houses in the middle of a town, there will be protests against destroying the green space, and if they are built on the outskirts of a town, there will be protests against destroying the countryside. If high rise buildings are erected, the development will be seen to be too intensive and too close together and if single units are built, they will be considered too scattered. No matter what approach is taken, there always seems to be an immediate campaign ready to be ignited in opposition. Members will be aware that for the next fortnight or three weeks leading up to the elections a great many words will be written and spoken in support of and, more likely, in opposition to such projects.</P>
    <P>We have entered an era when people become apoplectic with rage at proposals that may seem perfectly reasonable to others. We must address the State's capacity to provide income and revenue for State services such as health, education, social welfare, even the social welfare system for lawyers that is the tribunals, and all the other demands on the State. We are fast approaching a time when any enterprise is likely to face the threat of being choked. While it is fashionable to say that the Celtic tiger is strong, durable and tough, I do not believe it can sustain forever these attacks on development, the provision of housing and other means of income generation for the State and the people in the face of relentless opposition.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. I welcome its introduction because it addresses the legal shortcomings in the current legislative framework. However, we must face up to some unpalatable facts and choices in relation to where we are progressing if we wish to <Col N="553" /> continue to provide an improved level of services across a range of sectors. Nothing is more central to providing for the people than investment in resources, including mineral resources. We must be prepared to invest in and draw benefit from these resources for the benefit of the people. However, we must be prepared to use these resources sensibly and to abide by good environmental practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition spokespersons and other Deputies who contributed to the debate on this complex issue. During the debate we had a fairly searching review of the general issues involved in mining in Ireland and highlighted some of the key issues and problems. Deputy Killeen is correct with regard to the growing opposition to exploration and mining. This problem must be overcome and mining companies have an important role to play in this regard. Galmoy and Lisheen mines have set a very high standard which is recognised not alone on a European basis, but on a much wider basis. Deputy Killeen also made the point that when he was somewhat younger people were not aware that this country had such resources. We know now that we have considerable resources and that we must manage, control and develop them. There are recent top class examples of this, not only in Ireland but internationally. Great credit is due to successive Governments and to the companies who have worked to develop these resources.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to rationalise aspects of the existing legislation relating to mineral ownership, to further streamline permission for mines under the Minerals Development Acts 1940-1995. For a small country, we have been very successful in the discovery of mineral deposits which have resulted in a number of important mines currently in operation. Our geology offers considerable prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>At present there are 300 prospecting licences in operation, with exploration focusing mainly on base metals but with considerable interest also in precious metals, gemstones and industrial minerals. There are four significant mines operating currently in Ireland which provide direct employment for over 1,000 people on a continuous basis, with much higher levels of employment in the initial stages for each of these mines. In addition to the gypsum quarry at Knocknacran, which is a major supplier to the current construction boom, there are three major zinc and lead mines in Navan, County Meath, Galmoy, County Kilkenny and Lisheen, County Tipperary. When Lisheen reaches full production, Ireland will be the seventh largest zinc producing country in the world. For a small country, that is quite an achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my aim to ensure that deposits of minerals continue to be found and developed in a responsible way for the benefit of the national and local economies. The legislative measures contained in the Minerals Development Bill, 1999 are part of <Col N="554" /> an ongoing effort to keep legislation practices in the mineral sector up to date and relevant to modern industry. Along with other natural resources, our mineral deposits are an important national asset. There is great potential for further discoveries. This is important legislation which will help in the ongoing development of these resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen raised the Kilbricken deposit, a small calcite deposit, in County Clare. There were some objections to this proposal at local level. The developer has been refused planning permission on grounds related to road access problems. A fresh planning application will be forthcoming. It is important to mention in connection with this potential development that an integrated pollution control licence has been obtained and the State mining lease application is currently under negotiation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned Gypsum Industries Limited, which holds the Glangevlin prospecting licence and is working on it assiduously. If it decides to develop the deposit, there is no reason to believe it will not be processed with its other product. At present it is not in a position to make a decision on the deposit. We will ensure it comes to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis raised the health and safety of workers. The Health and Safety Authority is actively involved in regulating the safety of workers and health conditions. Compensation is already payable to mineral owners under the Acts, which also provide for arbitration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brendan Smith also mentioned the value of Knocknacran in County Monaghan and Kingscourt in County Cavan in terms of employment made available by the company. He is anxious that studies there will be finalised as soon as possible and that the local community will benefit. I assure him that we will watch that closely.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Brady spoke of the success of Tara Mines over the years. Much of its contribution has been exemplary. Even at a time when zinc prices were low, and this is a problem which affected Tara Mines, it provided valuable employment in that area. I assisted its further development by granting more licences recently. Those licences will enable work there to continue.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ellis and Finucane were concerned about the transport problem. Deputy Ellis mentioned the royalties and asked that they be published. The royalties are a matter of public record. There is a booklet published on them and every six months a report on them is laid in the Oireachtas Library. He was also concerned about the possibility of a cross-Border gas find. There would be no difficulty in sharing a resource of that kind with the co-operation which now exists. Both Deputies were also concerned about offshore rigs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane expressed concern about the use of rail and the problem of crowding on the roads. I also had ideas about the ports. The com<Col N="555" /> pany, however, was free to negotiate with the ports. The ports operate now as independent commercial bodies; they are free to make their arrangements and to offer deals on this. Cork emerged as the winner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that we might also have had other ideas about that. Rail use presents a similar problem because we cannot say to operators that they must use one method of transport unless the State is prepared to equalise the costs. There are many others using the roads and the same should apply to them; the issues need to be addressed. I have my own ideas about the ports and the desirability of feeding from them into local regions to avoid cross hauling.</P>
      <P>The present position at Lisheen is that there were environmental and planning studies. These reports, which approved the methods of transport and the contribution of certain funds towards the roads, were accepted. It still leaves the broader question on a national basis to be addressed. I agree that the rail system should be used to a greater extent if possible. I tried to do that with the ports. It was found, however, that the carriages used are not suitable. Iarnród Éireann would have to invest in a different size of carriage to facilitate this. That would mean more investment. It is investing to an extent but there is a need for integration on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane raised the issue of offshore exploration. I am delighted that there are good prospects in the Corrib region. Marathon has reached agreement with Saga to acquire 18.5 per cent of the Corrib licences. Saga currently holds 40 per cent. That acquisition will come to me shortly for approval. It is an indication of interest in the initial finds there. Although we are careful about what we say, the matter will have to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I want to see more servicing of these initial exploratory offshore drillings &ndash; the second of which is taking place &ndash; undertaken in Ireland. I will do anything I can to try to bring that about. As the Deputy mentioned, Killybegs will benefit to some extent. The ports are all open now under EU law and people can easily move to another one for servicing, which is what happened in that situation. That was a serious and unfortunate loss to Foynes in the first instance and to Ireland again last year. This year some of that work will be regained but we would like to see much more of it being done in Ireland.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the gas coming ashore it is a very different situation. I am anxious to ensure that a great deal of the servicing will be sourced in Ireland and that the benefits will come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were asked about the financial terms and the royalties. To refer to what Deputy Kil<Col N="556" /> leen said, in the 1990s there was little interest in prospecting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Minister was: what are the estimated royalties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address that in two ways. To keep it in a logical sequence, my predecessors &ndash; I may have a more kindly approach to them than people often have &ndash; were faced with a different situation. We were trying to encourage prospecting and development and the royalties and various charges were designed for that purpose. They were very successful.</P>
      <P>The royalties for the Lisheen mine, for instance, are 1.75 per cent of revenue, that is, total turnover, per annum for the first three years of production to allow them to get started; 3 per cent of revenues per annum for the fourth and fifth years of production; and 4.5 per cent of revenues per annum for each subsequent year of production. There is also a dead rent which merges with the royalties and that is £50,000 for the first year; £100,000 for the second year; and £300,000 per annum for the third and subsequent years. That is the basis of the rents. In addition there is a £9.5 million closure provision for the proper closure of the mine at the end of its life.</P>
      <P>Taken in the context of the development cost which is enormous at £162 million, one is asking somebody to invest £162 million and get all of this going. However, that is from where the 700 jobs came during the development period as there was huge expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Galmoy mine is smaller and it was developed earlier. The royalties were 1.5 per cent for the first three years; 2.5 per cent for the fourth year; and then 3 per cent for each subsequent year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will see that the rate of royalties rose during the period between the development of the Galmoy mine in 1995, and the Lisheen mine. The minerals in the Galmoy case were private minerals and came into the private category. Royalties for the minerals in the other case are at the higher rates of 1.75 per cent, 3 per cent and 4.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>To estimate the royalties involves making calculations from that. Deputy Bell asked the question and I could say that if he tabled a parliamentary question, we will get him the answer but on a rough calculation, in about three years &ndash; it would probably be better to say four years because then it would be at the top rate &ndash; the figure will be up to £1 million per annum for Galmoy and up to £3 million and rising subsequently to £4 million for Lisheen.</P>
      <P>The royalties for Tara were bought out at an earlier stage. It was part of a £50 million deal which was made in relation to the State's 25 per cent equity stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> On the question of royalties for gas and petroleum, in the early 1990s interest in exploration was at a low ebb and the future promised no further exploration. A review of the licensing terms concluded that the only way to attract the industry was to offer commercially attractive terms, including generous allowances for write-off, a low level of tax of 25 per cent and zero royalties. This strategy was successful in bringing back exploration but new production has not yet come on stream, although we are hopeful about the Corrib find.</P>
    <P>To take the overall situation, and Marathon in the Kinsale field, over 20 years 20 per cent of Ireland's energy needs have been provided and savings of more than £3 billion on energy imports have resulted. The Kinsale gas find is running down at this stage and there is no question about it. Recently we issued some further licences which will give a little extra gas at the end in some other areas. It will get the last out of the find but it is still running down. Hence, it is probably not surprising to find Marathon with an interest in the Corrib find at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell also asked about the creation of an Irish smelter but this is not regarded as economically viable. The volumes and the continuity would want to be much greater. We talked about problems with mining, but the Deputy can just imagine the environmental problems of a smelter. Taking account of the overall supply of smelting facilities in Europe, a new smelter would not be viable. In other words, there are sufficient smelting facilities available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane raised the question of the N69 and I noted what he had to say about it. It is relevant to the whole issue. He also asked why the Geological Survey of Ireland forms part of the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise and not the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. The GSI has much in common with my Department. We work closely with it on Marine Institute issues and on the seabed survey. It is possible that at some time in the future it may move closer to my Department. Currently, we work well together in any event. Deputies are generally told it is not possible to backdate provisions. Deputy Bell suggested that when big companies come along, it becomes possible to do so, but that is not really the case. Mineral rights are not private property and do not come within the scope of the constitutional protection of private property. No private citizens are adversely affected. The advice of the Attorney General is that we can backdate this provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane expressed a wish to consider the rail system further on Committee Stage. We can certainly do that. The general position in that regard must be considered both by us and the EU.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about blue whiting and the penalties which applied in regard to the <Col N="558" /> recent over-fishing. The Commission moved very quickly on the matter and the fishing stopped within two days. One of the two countries involved stopped fishing immediately and the other carried on for an extra day or two. Offhand, I cannot inform the Deputy of the penalties involved for such a breach. If a country over-fishes, the Commission examines all its figures to elicit the extra amount fished. The figure is subtracted from a country's subsequent allocation. That penalty is operated all the time and occasionally affects Ireland. As Minister, I must intervene sharply from time to time to ensure we do not exceed the allowable catch. It can be a very sore point if the Commission lowers our allocation and fishermen are unable to fish for a few extra days in autumn. Commissioner Bonino acted very swiftly in this case, as did the fishermen in alerting us to what they saw. We immediately contacted the Commission which accepted our criticism and, in turn, acted immediately to address it.</P>
    <P>We had some difficulty in relation to the percentage figure for horse mackerel. We would probably have been due a 28 per cent allocation. There were some arguments about our fishermen's quantities but our statistics indicated a figure in the region of 28 per cent and we received 26.5 per cent. I felt that since the principle applied rigorously to us at the outset, it should also have applied at a later stage. We had quite a big row over the issue.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions in this searching debate which highlighted the importance of these minerals and the necessity to look after them in a responsible manner. I will arrange for the spokespersons and any other interested parties to visit some of the mines. They are well worth a visit in their finished state and people come from all over the world to see how well they operate at Galmoy and Lisheen.</P>

      <P>&ndash;noting that the annual funding targets identified as essential in the report 'Towards an Independent Future' have not been reached;</P>

      <P>and demands that the Government produce before 30 June 1999 a fully costed programme to achieve the objectives of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, &lsquo;A Strategy for Equality', within a new specified timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> Since this House last debated a Private Members' motion on the needs of people with intellectual, physical or sensory disability, Ireland received the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, presented the award to President McAleese earlier this month. It would be useful to remind Members of what the UN Secretary General said at that time about Ireland and our attitudes to people with disabilities. He stated:</P>
    <P>Central to the UN World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons is the goal of full and equal participation by persons with disabilities in all aspects of life, regardless of the level of development of their country. Today, we honour Ireland and its people for reaching farther and doing more in the pursuit of that goal.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been setting the pace in the cause of the disabled in many ways: by creating a Minister of State position with responsibility for disability and inequality; by enacting an Employment Equality Act which outlaws discrimination in employment against a number of groups, including people with disabilities. Just as importantly, Ireland has led the cause of the disabled on the international level, particularly in the European Union where it has promoted new and expanded measures to ensure Europe-wide equality for the disabled.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of how deserving you are of this reward. It is my hope that other nations will look to you and learn of the great promise that exists for every society in empowering the disabled among their people and enabling them to make the most of their lives. I am confident that you, too, will inspire other nations to recognise that the cause of the disabled is a cause that nobody can afford to ignore.</P>
    <P>Since the UN Secretary General made that speech, two other significant items of legislation were enacted or introduced in this House. They are the Equal Status Bill, Second Stage of which we debated here last week, and the National Disability Authority Bill, which completed Report and Final Stages recently. This seems to be an impressive record.</P>
    <P>It appears that the legislative equality agenda, which seeks to empower and enable people with disabilities to achieve and exercise their economic, social, political and civil rights, is all but complete. If that is the case, however, why is there need for a Private Members' motion in the House this evening which notes the shortfalls, the waiting lists and the regional imbalances in the provision of services? If Ireland has reached farther and done more, if Ireland is setting the pace and is an inspiration to others in the cause of people with disabilities, why do we need to debate these issues here? We need to debate these issues because we need to remind ourselves, and particularly the Government which is <Col N="561" /> charged with responsibility for managing the economic well-being of the country, that legislation, while vital and welcome, does not have a world-changing effect on the lives of people with disabilities unless their basic needs are first satisfied. The motion tonight is about basic needs.</P>
    <P>People with physical, sensory or learning disabilities, their families, advocates and carers, for far too long have heard words like &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;integration&rdquo;, &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; and &ldquo;enabling&rdquo;, but what have they experienced and what do they continue to experience? They experience marginalisation, exclusion and powerlessness.</P>
    <P>It appears from the Government's amendment to this motion that there is, sadly, no will to provide these basic needs. The Government's amendment is mean-minded and self-congratulatory in tone. It does not take account of the fact that this Government, more than any other in recent years, has at its disposal resources which could, with political will, shorten the timeframe set out in the report, Towards an Independent Future, and the strategy for equality. These could make an enormous difference to the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>It does not take account of the fact that on Tuesday last, the Transport for All Group organised a demonstration to the Dáil to highlight that, in the words of its own press release, &ldquo;a form of apartheid currently exists in this country&rdquo;. The Government's amendment does not take account of the fact that people are still prisoners in their own homes because there is no accessible transport available to them. It does not take account of the fact that the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, in the preamble to its section on people with disabilities, states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and the aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates, are comprehensively addressed. We are committed to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of every Government Department and public body. Our policy is based on the core principles of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services.</P>
    <P>They were fine words with which we could all agree. In the same chapter under the heading &ldquo;Key Priorities&rdquo; the Government promises the introduction of a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to promoting access by people with disabilities to the use of public spaces and facilities and to the range of public transport.</P>
    <P>Two years into the lifetime of the Government we are being asked, in the words of the Government amendment, to approve &ldquo;The Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision [as it now calls it] outlined in the programme for Government&rdquo;. How can the House approve the Minister's amendment when the Government's track record speaks <Col N="562" /> for itself? How can we approve of the Government's commitment when the Exchequer funded 150 buses, none of which are accessible to wheelchair users?</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Equal Status Bill would have made it impossible for the Minister for Public Enterprise to order new buses which are not accessible to wheelchair users. Unfortunately, the introduction of the Bill came too late for those already excluded. Even if we had fully accessible public transport some people would still be trapped in their own homes. Even if we had enacted the Equal Status Bill they would be excluded from full participation in many aspects of life. Despite the Employment Equality Act, these people, sadly, will not be competing for jobs or taking advantage of the booming economy.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association recently estimated that 2,667 of its members do not benefit from day activity or development. Of these people, 1,248 are totally physically isolated, in short, they are prisoners in their own homes; 1,153 still require aids and appliances and 1,375 require personal assistance with basic needs such as dressing and feeding. How can legislation help people to participate fully when they cannot even get out of bed without a hoist which they may not have? How can legislation protect the rights of these people to be considered for a job when they cannot get dressed without an assistant which, in many cases, they do not have? How can we justify the fact that, despite Ireland's legislative record and the booming economy, there has been little or no investment in personal assistance schemes for people with disabilities? How many more thousands of people, who are not members of the IWA, require services which are not provided? How many more members require such services but are not on a database?</P>
    <P>This motion was designed to unite, not divide, the House. Two motions in the past seven or eight months have called on the Government to provide additional resources for the provision of services to persons with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities. On each occasion the Minister and the Government did nothing but congratulate themselves on having provided a few resources. We accept that they can point to improved levels of services in some areas. However, the consensus in the House must be that we should do more and do it now.</P>
    <P>Ireland received a prestigious international award and has been cited as having set the pace for change. Why can we not agree to speed up that pace? Why do we continue to take things slowly when the need for change and the reasons for making such change are self evident?</P>
    <P>The motion asks the Government to take stock; to provide additional money; to accelerate the rate of change in tangible and practical ways; to make changes which will allow people to take advantage of educational and employment opportunities and to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities in real and practical ways. We need a new timetable for change. We <Col N="563" /> need legislative change but, most importantly, we need practical change.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes may be small, such as more personal assistance services, more aids and appliances, more residential and respite care and more day resource centres and services. This is the policy at a macro level and we are making progress at legislative level. However, at a micro level people are still living lives of desperation and despair because of a lack of basic services.</P>
    <P>A sentence from the report &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo; will assist in setting the scene for this debate. Dr. Ruth Barrington wrote on behalf of the review group that: &ldquo;The main thrust of our report is the development of services to enable people with a physical or sensory disability to live as independently as possible in the community&rdquo;. Key issues in the submission to the review group highlight deficiencies in the system, which should be designed to achieve the objectives outlined above &ndash; enabling those with disabilities and giving them independence.</P>
    <P>The submission to the review group highlighted a lack of comprehensive data on the numbers and the services needed; inadequate access to information on service provision; disparities in eligibility criteria between and within health boards; inadequate statutory funding for individuals; uncertain funding of voluntary organisations; shortfalls in services relating to therapy, day care, counselling and home support; uneven geographic distribution of services; inadequate transport services; inadequate co-ordination of services and poor consumer choice. Would the Minister not agree that this is a litany of disaster?</P>
    <P>However, the situation is not hopeless. By producing a fully costed programme to achieve the objectives of &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo; in a new, specified timeframe, the Government could make a real difference to the lives of those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Every day the parents of children with an intellectual disability face the painful reality that their children's quality of life will always be decided by others. Far from being the beneficiaries of a comprehensive and seamless service, parents and families may face a lifetime of struggle and delay. One of the submissions to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, quoted in the report of that body, &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;, graphically illustrates this point. A parent states: &ldquo;It appears to us that the parents of a disabled child face a lifetime of fighting each and every agency and Department for their rights and those of their child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children's document &ldquo;Services to People with a Mental Handicap/Intellectual Disability &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001&rdquo; added a new dimension to the development and planning of comprehensive services for people with a mental handicap. It comprehensively describes the essential needs of those with mental handicap. The intellectual disability database identifies 26,694 people with a <Col N="564" /> mental handicap or intellectual disability. Of those, 604 people receive no service from the State and 22,804 receive some service. Of the 26,694 men, women and children, 1,439 &ndash; one person in every 20 &ndash; are waiting for residential and respite care and 1,036 are waiting for the provision of day care. It is constant waiting. Analysis of the data shows that, due to medical advances, the adult population in the database has increased by 31 per cent since 1974. Of the 26,694 people on the database, 61 per cent or 16,453 are aged 20 or over and, of those, 8,283 are aged 35 or over and 2,203 are aged over 55. The Department of Health and Children states that the average age of those requiring residential placement is 31.6 years and those requiring day places is 35.9 years.</P>
    <P>If we do not provide those essential residential and day places, who is doing the work? The principal carers of persons with mental handicap are their parents. The age profile of those identified as requiring a service has a significant implication. Elderly parents are caring for their middle aged and older sons or daughters. Parents in their 70s and 80s are looking after their adult mentally handicapped sons or daughters. For all of them, apart from the daily physical and emotional demands made on them, there is the fear of what will happen to their child if they die or become incapacitated. We claim to value our elderly people. The Minister for Finance said he had concentrated resources in this year's budget on pensioners, but where are they?</P>
    <P>Based on the figures above, it is clear that over 8,000 old age pensioners care for a dependent mentally handicapped son or daughter and give everything they have left every day to care for their handicapped child because there are no day centres and no respite care. What has the Minister done for them? Will the welcome increase in their old age pensions relieve the pressure of caring? Will it provide the residential, day or respite care they desperately need for their children and themselves? Will it end the sleepless nights and provide peace of mind? We know the answers to those questions are in the negative.</P>
    <P>While it is true the Government has allocated some resources to assist with the scandal of the waiting list for respite and residential care for those with an intellectual disability, much more needs to be done. In a letter to my colleague, Deputy Shatter, the Carmona Parents' and Friends' Association summed up what it sees as a crisis in the provision of services for people with learning disabilities in south-east Dublin and east Wicklow. The letter explains the association requested £7 million to deal with waiting lists for residential, day, crisis and respite care. The Minister for Health and Children allocated it £252,500. It pointed out that this will provide five residential places and six day places in 1999 but that its waiting list is much longer. It needed 92 residential places, 180 respite places, 25 crisis places and 17 day service places. Surely that should have been taken into account. Unfortunately, bad as <Col N="565" /> that experience is, it is not unique. A new, real and meaningful timetable for funding with an accelerated pace would reassure those people that practical help is on the way.</P>
    <P>The House will debate the Bill on the Statute of Limitations tomorrow. We have recently concentrated on the abuse of children in the care of the State in industrial schools and orphanages. We are rightly outraged by the pain and suffering people have undergone. We would also be outraged if we thought large numbers of people were still suffering abuse and neglect. We should be outraged. There are large numbers of people suffering neglect by the State. They are people with disabilities and we are still abusing their rights. We continue to do so when we do not provide the necessary resources to allow them to avail of day care, respite care, special education, personal assistance and aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>I remind the Government what President McAleese said when she accepted the Roosevelt International Disability Award on behalf of the people of Ireland:</P>
    <P>While we feel privileged and pleased to be the recipient country, we know that this award carries with it a serious moral obligation to ensure that we maintain and accelerate the momentum for change in disability related policy and service provision.</P>
    <P>It places a moral obligation on us if we are to be worthy recipients of that award to provide the necessary additional resources. Later in her address the President said:</P>
    <P>We have failed our people with disabilities and, in the process, seriously damaged our society. How much talent has been wasted because people with disabilities have not been given the opportunities and means to develop their gifts? How much genius has been lost forever to our world because of this? That loss has not only been a personal tragedy. . . it has also immeasurably impoverished our society.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. The Government should help enrich society, not just by introducing legislation but through real and practical service provision and it should be done sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The Government's programme states that it recognises disability as one of the most important social issues facing Ireland. I agree with that. I am glad the Government recognises such a fact and I hope that, in a time of unprecedented Exchequer returns, we would see fit as a State to financially support those who, through no fault of their own, are born with, or through illness or accident have acquired, a disability, be it intellectual, physical or sensory. We should not forget that a Government should govern society and not a financial institution. It should be a society which ensures full participation and integration of its citizens and one which gives them an opportunity to gain <Col N="566" /> equality of access and mobility so that their disabilities become sidelined and they can reach their full potential as human beings. When one reads the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;, and becomes familiar with the discussions it held throughout the country with people with disabilities and their families on practical issues, one of the single greatest matters of concern which emerged was the question of access and transport. It emerged that people felt marginalised and trapped in their homes because of public policy in respect of transport, a policy which forgot to take account of the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that the 150 additional buses being provided in Dublin will be inaccessible to wheelchair users. Where will such thinking lead? Have we learned nothing from the reports produced on the subject of equality? These buses are paid for by taxpayers' money but the rights of the citizens of this country have not been taken into consideration. It was a scandal that people in wheelchairs were obliged to take to the streets recently to demonstrate against the fact that they cannot gain access to public transport.</P>
      <P>Disabled persons have the same entitlement to public transport as anyone else and yet their needs are ignored. It should be the standard that all forms of public transport are accessible to wheelchair users. No single element of a public transport system should be inaccessible to wheelchairs. That is what equality means. I accept this will require investment but if we do not take action now, in the so-called &ldquo;good times&rdquo;, what chance is there that such investment will be made in the event of an economic downturn?</P>
      <P>The service provided to wheelchair users in Dublin by taxis which were licensed for that purpose seems to be falling short of what was envisaged. The streets are full of these taxis but people in wheelchairs do not seem to be able to avail of the service. Drivers are too busy picking up fares elsewhere and it seems they are not willing to spend the extra time needed to load a wheelchair on board, secure the passenger and then help them disembark when they reach their destination.</P>
      <P>In my view it was a mistake to grant taxi licences to drivers on the condition that their vehicles are wheelchair accessible &ndash; it has been described by many as a taxi licence obtained by the back door. There is no check on the number of wheelchair fares taken by individual taxis. Taxi drivers are commercially driven and will not provide a service that is less viable than any other. What is needed is some form of service dedicated to the disabled. State funding should be provided to support such a service because commercial interests will not facilitate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of controversy in Cork city during the past month. Many public meetings were held and public representatives were contacted about the fact that a firm which was offering a transport service for the disabled has ceased <Col N="567" /> trading. A number of years ago, Able Cabs was persuaded to operate a taxi service for the disabled. With two suitable vehicles, the company provided a lifeline for the disabled. The company provided a dedicated service to wheelchair users and their families but, unfortunately, the business was not viable. However, it was very successful in its aim to provide an essential social service which was not being provided by the State. This service could be used as a model of how to serve the disabled but financial intervention is required.</P>
    <P>If a taxi service is totally dedicated to the disabled, should it not be exempt from VAT and VRT charges as is the case with disabled drivers? The difference is that the passengers, not the driver, will be disabled. What is the position regarding exemption from VAT on petrol and diesel? Does it make sense to levy these charges on disabled people? Exemption would be a step towards facilitating a disabled transport service. I realise that these proposals would not offset the additional cost of providing special vehicles and, therefore, additional assistance in respect of running costs should also be provided. A subsidy based on the mileage covered by taxis to defray these costs could also be considered.</P>
    <P>The situation in Cork is now drastic. The only transport service for the disabled was withdrawn two weeks ago and there are now no wheelchair accessible taxis available in the city. The corporation issued five new licences for wheelchair accessible taxis in the past month but these are unlikely to come on stream until September if not later. Based on what I have seen in Dublin, I have grave reservations about their ability to provide a service for the disabled.</P>
    <P>Many disabled people in Cork face the prospect of increased isolation and further marginalisation. How can they do their shopping, collect children from school and attend medical appointments and physiotherapy clinics without access to transport? They are effectively stranded and left dependent on the support of others. There is only one wheelchair accessible bus in Cork, a token gesture which has had little or no impact.</P>
    <P>I wish to read to the House a letter which was published in many national newspapers. It was written by a young woman of my acquaintance in Cork and it expresses the views of disabled people in the city regarding the lack of access to public transport. The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Editor</P>
    <P>I would like to bring up the topic of &ldquo;Public Transport for the Disabled&rdquo;. How generous the State is to provide me with a free travel pass. I had to have my personal assistant drive me to the bus depot to have my photograph taken for this wonderful free travel pass. When I was there I inquired how many buses in Cork city could take wheelchairs. I was told one. Is this not discrimination? Shame on the State.</P>
    <P>For the past two years I have been lucky enough to be able to use the services of Able Cabs but this service is to cease on 21 April as <Col N="568" /> it was not financially viable. I feel violated that the State did not feel it its duty to make a contribution to this wonderful service. Might I also add that in the '80s it was the &ldquo;year of the disabled&rdquo;. Here we are in 1999, heading into the new millennium, and the State has not yet provided any service and yet it tries to create the illusion by encouraging private business to make a few taxis accessible without proper guidelines on how to achieve this. Surely the existing service could have been encouraged to continue as they genuinely provided an excellent service for the disabled in this city.</P>
    <P>That letter was written by a person who now finds herself further marginalised and stranded in her home.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke to a young mother in Cork whose young son of almost four years of age, is described as being mildly mentally retarded. Since he was born the mother has been engaged in a constant battle to gain State services for him. Last week, after a two year struggle, it was confirmed that the Southern Health Board will provide the services of a speech therapist. However, the speech therapist will only be available for approximately six weeks. After that, the mother will face a further battle. She has ensured that her son will have schooling for the next 12 months but when he reaches five years of age she will face a further fight when he is installed in his new school.</P>
    <P>The toll a person with a mental disability imposes on his or her family members cannot be underestimated. Providing care for these people is a full-time job, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and family members cannot even travel to the local shop without first ensuring that they are secure. These families need access to respite care which will provide them with the opportunity to recharge their batteries. Children with autism will also benefit enormously from special schooling and the opportunity to communicate with the assistance of speech therapists. Spouses and family members of those who suffer from Alzheimer's disease need society's support through the provision of respite care and day-care centres.</P>
    <P>Numerous reports have been produced since the mid-1990s to highlight the gaps in the services provided. What is now required on the part of everyone in the House is a commitment to the children and adults to whom I refer to give them the necessary financial support to enable them to live their lives to their full potential. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an <Col N="569" /> enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments, which include the provision of additional funding of £91.662 million and the putting in place of arrangements to meet the educational needs of children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The disability sector, people suffering from disabilities, their parents and families, often look with a jaundiced eye at the timing of debates such as this in the midst of election campaigns when many commitments and promises are given, usually far more generous from the Opposition side than the Government side. It does not add much to the debate. Part of Deputy Ahearn's speech was untypically constructive.</P>
    <P>Given that these issues are ongoing, the concern of successive Governments and that people need to make decisions as to who is more likely to deal with these issues on the basis of need, I am prepared to have the Government's record put side by side with the record of the previous Government for the previous three years. That is the basis on which people should decide. We can make rhetorical speeches, point to the problems in the service and say a particular Government would do better, but the Opposition parties were also in Government.</P>
    <P>The idea has come about that it is only now we can do something for the disability sector. I remind Deputies that when the leader of the Labour Party was Minister for Finance and Deputy Jim Higgins was Chief Whip, three budgets were passed totalling public expenditure of over £45 billion. Is it suggested there was no money at that time? Is it suggested no opportunities were available to the rainbow coalition to show its commitment, apart from all its politically correct speeches? I am not interested in that type of politics. I am interested in coming into office and getting an opportunity to improve the situation, to bring in orderly, planned improvements year on year. I will not say to the disability sector that all their problems can be solved overnight because they cannot and will not be solved overnight. We should have more respect for people about whom we claim we are concerned. We must be honest and state what we intend to do, outline the strategy, how we will work in partnership with voluntary bodies, parents and friends' associations of the mentally handicapped, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Association and many other voluntary bodies which are trying to maintain or improve a service or obtain a service where none exists.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more acutely aware of those issues than an incumbent Minister for Health and Children who takes his or her job seriously. I am not prepared to say that a wand can be waved which will solve the problems but I am prepared to state my record. This amendment is not self-congratulatory. It points out there is a need for further development of services to people with intellec<Col N="570" /> tual, sensory and physical disabilities. I am not suggesting the problems are solved. That is not the real world. The reality is that the Government is providing more services, resources and opportunities to ensure the disability sector has improved services. That was the case with all previous administrations.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that 46 residential places for intellectual disability were provided in 1996 when the Deputies opposite supported an administration on this side. This resulted in a huge problem in the delivery of emergency cases which came onstream and for which there was not even a contingency fund, not to mention the need to improve and increase the level of residential, respite or day care for mental handicap. It is only now we are dealing with that situation to ensure we get back on the path of producing an increased number of places as a result of increased allocations, which put to shame the allocations of the previous administrations in terms of development moneys in this sector. I will not use those facts as a means to say everything is honky dorey. I am committed to continuing as Minister for Health and Children, using my influence in Government with the agreement of my colleagues to provide further development moneys to deal with the issues. The Opposition should stop stating rhetorical platitudes. That impresses nobody because people are fed up listening to it and I will not engage in it.</P>
    <P>Members will recall we had two debates late last year on services for people with disabilities, in early November on services for people with intellectual disability and in early December on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. However, I am pleased to have this further opportunity to reiterate the Government's commitment to the development of these services and to outline the progress which has been made since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges which go with citizenship and that all obstacles to the enjoyment of these rights and privileges should be removed. These obstacles have been identified by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report, A Strategy for Equality. That report adopted three guiding principles: equality, maximising participation and enabling independence and choice. Bearing in mind these principles, the overall thrust of health policy for people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable each individual to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence.</P>
    <P>What is involved in ensuring equality, participation and independence for people with disabilities is a lot more than health services appropriate to their needs. People with disabilities have called for a departure from &ldquo;the health model of disability&rdquo;. They wish to be treated the same as their fellow citizens by having services delivered to them by the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; agencies, that is, <Col N="571" /> the same agency that provides the particular service to the rest of the community. This is one of the objectives set out by the commission in A Strategy for Equality. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, has special responsibility for disability issues and is co-ordinating the Government's action in implementing A Strategy for Equality across the range of Departments involved.</P>
    <P>A progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the commission is nearing completion and will be submitted to Government at an early date. Since the commission's report was published, significant milestones have been achieved in promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities. These include: the establishment of an interim Irish Council of People with Disabilities, the enactment of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the publication on 19 April 1999 of the Equal Status Bill and the establishment of an interim National Disability Authority board.</P>
    <P>In addition, steps are being taken to establish a new national disability authority on a statutory basis to establish a new body to fulfil, among other things, the role of the disability support service recommended by the commission and the transfer of responsibility for vocational training and employment from my Department to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>A specific commitment is given in the Programme for Government to the implementation of A Strategy for Equality. The programme states &ldquo;key priorities will include implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities&rdquo;. The practical steps needed to develop services in my area of responsibility are set out in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, and in Services to People with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001. A commitment to implement the recommendations of Towards an Independent Future is given in Partnership 2000 and in my Department's Strategy Statement 1998-2001, which states &ldquo;resources will be allocated within overall expenditure parameters for the development of services to persons with disabilities in line with the report of the review group&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A commitment is also given in both documents to pursue the development of services for persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs identified by the national intellectual disability database. That database is now providing information on services currently being provided and on current and future needs. The number of people on the database in 1996 was 26,804. The data reveals an ageing population in the more severe range of disability. The higher numbers of young adults and increased life expectancy will mean that the pressure currently being experi<Col N="572" /> enced by adult day services will increase as this group ages and requires residential services.</P>
    <P>At present there are no definitive statistics in relation to the number of people in this country with physical and sensory disabilities. Based on population trends in other countries, it has been estimated that the number in Ireland could be as high as 200,000. However, not every person with a physical or sensory disability needs a health service. The report, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, highlighted the lack of reliable information on the number and service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities and recommended the establishment by the Department of Health and Children, health boards and voluntary bodies of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>As a first step the review group recommended the establishment by my Department of a database development committee to prepare detailed proposals for the development of the database. This committee was established in December last and hopes to complete its work by the end of this year. This will pave the way for the putting in place of the database next year. Once it has been established, the database will provide the factual information necessary for the orderly planning of service developments at national, regional and sub-regional level, including prioritising service needs and assisting in decisions on the allocation of resources. The report, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, which was published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of the services over a five year period. I have already stated on a number of occasions that I am committed to the implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>The important role of the voluntary sector was fully recognised by the review group in looking at the organisation of services. The group recommended the structured involvement of the voluntary agencies in the planning and co-ordinating of the services and in the fixing of priorities for the allocation of funding for the development of the services. One recommendation of the review group was that the chief executive officer of each health board should establish a regional co-ordinating committee for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Membership of the committee should comprise officers of the health board, voluntary sector service providers, representatives of service users, that is, people with disabilities, and the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that these committees have now been established in every health board. My Department is currently pursuing a review of the operation of the committees in consultation with the health boards and the voluntary organisations concerned. The purpose of the review is to identify best practice, encourage a cross-fertilisation of ideas across the regions, come up with solutions to any teething problems which may have arisen and to contribute to the development of <Col N="573" /> overall national policy. A major element of the review process is a seminar which was held in Portlaoise last week. This seminar brought together all the participating parties to discuss progress to date and ways in which the operation of the committees could be made more effective.</P>
    <P>Regarding carers, people with disabilities living at home require assistance with the tasks of daily living and often responsibility for the care rests with one person principally. The review group report acknowledges the need to expand and develop different levels of home support services for people with disabilities and their carers. The crucial role of the carer is taken into account in the planning of services with, for example, the strong emphasis placed on the development of respite care services which benefit the person with a disability and the carer. The provision of this and other support services with the object of enabling the person with a disability to remain in the home serve the dual purpose of promoting independent living for the person with a disability and taking as much pressure as possible off the carer.</P>
    <P>A substantial package of improvements in the carers allowance was provided in the 1999 budget. All 11,500 existing carers will benefit from these measures while an additional 3,300 new carers will now qualify for the allowance. The total package for carers amounts to over £18 million annually. This is a large additional increase on the existing £45 million spent on carers in 1998 and indicates the Government's commitment to carers and the appreciation it has for their valuable role in our society.</P>
    <P>There have been calls from the Centre for Independent Living for a personal assistance service funded by an independent living fund. A personal assistant provides assistance at the discretion and direction of a person with a disability with everyday tasks, such as personal care, household tasks, etc., which the person is unable to do himself or herself. A full personal assistance service is defined by the Centre for Independent Living as a need for at least 20 hours service a week. The independent living fund is no more than a particular model for funding a personal assistance service. The important point is that the service is provided to those who need it; the precise manner of funding is a detail.</P>
    <P>The personal assistance service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence. The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care, etc., and the objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole. The amount of funding to be devoted to the development of this service will be decided in each health board area in accordance with locally perceived priorities.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, health boards decide on priorities for the allocation of development funding in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory <Col N="574" /> disability services. In addition, the Centre for Independent Living is represented on most of the co-ordinating committees. From a total of £3 million provided for development of services in 1998, personal assistance services were among those to which the boards allocated funds.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The Minister for Education and Science considers that this initiative represents a major advance in the education of all children with special educational needs and demonstrates the Government's commitment to the need to provide suitable education to children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full or part-time resource teacher or child care support, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs. A total of £8 million has been allocated over the next two years for teacher and special needs assistant support. Under that initiative, an additional 46 full-time and 26 part-time resource teachers have been allocated along with an additional 247 special needs assistant posts to assist school authorities cater for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science also recently reduced the pupil/teacher ratio in all special schools and special classes catering for children with mild learning disabilities, moderate learning disabilities, emotional disturbance and children with a physical disability. These reductions will bring the pupil/teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes down to the level recommended by the special education review committee and represents the full implementation of one of the key recommendations of that committee.</P>
    <P>In addition, £3.4 million has been allocated over the next two years to facilitate the introduction of escorts on all special school transport services and the provision of safety harnesses on such services when required. This measure will come into effect next September. A further £800,000 has been allocated over the next two years for the purchase of special equipment for children with disabilities. The Minister for Education and Science is also extending the remedial teaching service to ensure that all schools which currently do not have a remedial service will have access to this service with effect from next September.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that these measures provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them gain maximum benefit from the education system. I assure the House <Col N="575" /> that it is the intention of the Minister for Education and Science to continue to build on the very significant progress which has already been achieved in this area with the full support of his Government colleagues.</P>
    <P>Regarding housing, under the disabled persons grants scheme, local authorities may pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to a house to meet the needs of a member of the household with a disability. In the last budget, this grant was increased from a maximum of £8,000 to a maximum of £12,000.</P>
    <P>Another initiative designed to promote the interests of people with disabilities was the announcement in December 1997 by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, that he proposed by mid-1999 to amend the technical guidance documents on access for people with disabilities in order to make new dwellings commencing on or after 1 January 2000 socially accessible to them. The Minister has also signalled his willingness to review any other aspects of the technical guidance document on Part M in the light of representations made by people with disabilities. This is a golden opportunity for those affected by Part M to have an input into shaping its content.</P>
    <P>The arrival on our streets of buses which are accessible to wheelchairs is a major breakthrough in the pursuit of universal access. The Minister for Public Enterprise stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 31 March, for those who heard or saw it, that she is committed to making public transport facilities fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date. The CIE companies have been made fully aware of her policy in that regard and she is satisfied they will do all in their power to achieve that goal.</P>
    <P>The accessible buses, currently being operated by Dublin Bus on the No. 3 route, are also being piloted in Cork city by Bus Éireann, but Deputy Clune did not mention that. At the request of the Minister for Public Enterprise Dublin Bus is preparing a broad programme of trials for low floor buses. Depending on the result of these tests Dublin Bus should be in a position to order accessible double decker buses from 2000. In Cork, Bus Éireann currently has one low floor, single deck bus operating on the Bishopstown route and a wheelchair accessible school bus in the city. A further ten low floor vehicles are currently on order; Bus Éireann has stated that they are due for delivery in early summer and will be put into service on the company's Cork city and Limerick city routes.</P>
    <P>One difficulty in developing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is the wide range and variety of disabilities included in that category. This makes the development of the services complex. From time to time a certain group <Col N="576" /> will mount a campaign for the development of a particular service, for example, respite care and personal assistance. While these and other services are of vital importance and are among the priority areas for development they cannot be treated in isolation. What is involved is a wide range of interlocking and complementary services, designed to provide the person with a disability with a flexible range of services. Many individuals with disabilities may require a combination of several services to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Many services for people with disabilities are provided by agencies in the voluntary sector, often in response to demand from their own members. Some of these could be funded from fund raising income, but not all. The position developed over a period of years that services were not fully funded by the State. In recent years, with falling income from fund raising, most agencies have run services at a loss, thereby accumulating debts. A basic recommendation of the review group was that existing services be put on a firm financial footing in order to provide a sound basis for future development. Within months of coming into office this Government provided, by way of Supplementary Estimate, £5 million to eliminate the accumulated deficits of these agencies. To help eliminate the ongoing underfunding of the services, £2.4 million revenue was provided in 1998 and £6.4 million this year. Those are not insignificant amounts.</P>
    <P>One area singled out by people with disabilities and their advocates is aids and appliances for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Deputy Ahearn mentioned a waiting list of 1,100 people. Shortly after taking office this Government took the earliest possible opportunity to alleviate this problem by making £4.325 million available and it is estimated that more than 10,000 people with disabilities benefited from this Government's initiative. That opportunity was available to the previous Government for three years but it would not listen.</P>
    <P>A further £1 million capital funding was made available to health boards in 1998 for aids and appliances. Notwithstanding this funding, it was brought to my attention towards the end of 1998 that there were still substantial waiting lists in health boards for aids and appliances. I therefore allocated a further £4 million to eliminate these waiting lists. This Government cannot be accused of inaction. Despite these substantial injections of funding, health boards are still experiencing difficulty in keeping up with demand for aids and appliances &ndash; that is acknowledged. I do not have at my disposal at this point but I will consider making further funding available to boards for this purpose at the first available opportunity in Estimates discussions for the coming year.</P>
    <P>In 1997, in addition to the £9.325 million made available for aids and appliances and to eliminate the accumulated deficits of voluntary sector ser<Col N="577" /> vice providers, capital grants totalling £675,000 were given to voluntary sector service providers for the provision of additional respite and long-term residential care places. That is an indication of the practical steps taken by the Government to deal with basic issues. I agree with the Deputy that replacement wheelchairs or hearing aids are basic matters but the Rainbow Administration said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to 10,000 people for three years. Those people told me about it and we responded.</P>
    <P>In 1998 a total of £8.4 million was allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £2.4 million was devoted to eliminating core underfunding of existing services and nine of the main voluntary agencies in the sector received grants for this purpose. A further £3 million was for capital projects, of which, as I mentioned, £1 million was invested in aids and appliances. The balance of £3 million was allocated to health boards for the further development of the services. Almost half this funding was used to create 50 new posts in health boards, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and public health nurses.</P>
    <P>This year, a total of £13.4 million, rising to £16.4 million in the year 2000, has been allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Compare these figures to those of the Rainbow Administration. Of this £13.4 million, £6.4 million is for the elimination of underfunding of existing services, deficits built up during the previous Government; £3 million, which increases to a full year cost of £6 million in 2000, is for development; and £4 million is for capital developments. A further £2 million capital has been committed this year to a major building project by one of the main voluntary sector service providers.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, I have consistently identified the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and their families as one of my priorities. In addition to allocating significant levels of additional funding to develop new services and to meet identified needs in existing services, I have taken a number of measures to ensure that the services are developed in a planned and orderly manner in line with identified priority needs and with a secure financial basis for the future. That is the only way we can improve these services, there has been too much <i>ad hoc</i> provision in the past. The motion mentioned regional imbalances. These exist because there was no planned and orderly development of any service. It depended on whether one knew the Minister.</P>
    <P>While the additional services which have been put in place have made a significant difference, their impact on the waiting lists has been reduced because of the numbers of emergency admissions <Col N="578" /> which have been and continue to be made to the residential services, as a result of the cuts made in 1996 by the Rainbow Administration. The figures are there to prove it.</P>
    <P>Before this Administration there was never a national capital programme for mental handicap services. The social progressives who were in power for three years did not bother to introduce this. I listened to speeches from those people, now in Opposition, for a long time. When they got the chance they did not want to know.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2001 we will provide £30 million, which is facilitating the planning of the infrastructure necessary to support new services and to up-grade existing facilities, and more will be needed after that. The importance of having such a programme available to the services has already been demonstrated in that, in addition to the capital allocated to support new developments, I was also in a position in 1998 to approve a development plan for the services to persons with a mental handicap in St. lta's, Portrane. Nothing was done about that in the previous three years either. This major capital investment, funded jointly by my Department and the Eastern Health Board, will bring the facilities both on and off the hospital campus up to the highest modern standards. When I visited St. Ita's I did not bring a group of media people with me. I was pleased to be in a position to allocate additional revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for mental handicap services.</P>
    <P>In my area the Department's commitment to develop services for people with disabilities has been demonstrated by the investment of more than £91 million in the past two years and, again, more needs to be done. This has been mirrored by developments in a broad range of areas such as education, public transport and housing. As I also outlined, many positive developments are in the pipeline in a number of areas of concern for people with disabilities. It fair to say that a degree of optimism for the future by people with disabilities could be justified on the basis of present trends under this Administration, particularly on the basis of our demonstrable commitment to taking all positive steps to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. When the parties in Opposition were in power they did not take the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I congratulate Deputy Theresa Ahearn and her colleagues for putting it before the House. My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, the Labour Party spokesperson on equality, will speak in greater detail on the party's position on this subject. However, the House will be aware from previous debates of the Labour Party's commitment to providing the necessary resources for support and services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disability and for their advocates and carers.</P>
      <P>To underline that commitment, I refer to the speech of the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, at the party's recent conference in Tralee. He said:</P>
      <P>The absence of support services is a continuing source of stress for families whose love and hard work saves the State millions of pounds each year. It is time we made enough respite places available to support parents and carers. It is time we provided enough residential places so that carers are assured that when they can care no longer, their sons or daughters will be able to live full lives. Is it too much to ask of the Celtic tiger? I don't think so. If this Government cannot find the £60 million necessary from a budget surplus heading for £1,500 million, the Labour Party will.</P>
      <P>This issue is about priorities. Ireland is now a rich country. We no longer need the excuses we used in the past. The approach which characterised Government responses to people with disabilities was to lavish them with sympathy and send them away with the poor mouth excuse that the country could not afford supports. The country can afford to deal with this problem now. There are huge budget surpluses. The £65 million that is necessary to deal with this problem is available but I do not believe it will be provided or that there will be adequate provision to deal with this issue in the incremental method which appears to be favoured by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A positive political decision by the Government is required to provide the resources now and to provide the services that are needed by people with disabilities and their families. The Minister made much of the extra resources already provided. He said an additional £12 million has been provided this year. We need to get away from the figures for &ldquo;this year&rdquo; and for &ldquo;a full year&rdquo;. They can be misleading and do not amount to much when they are reflected in the services. The £12 million quoted by the Minister resulted in an allocation of £3.635 million for the <Col N="580" /> Eastern Health Board. What does that mean for the south eastern region of Dublin, an area which stretches from Ringsend to Bray and across to Stillorgan? It has a population of approximately 300,000. It is one of the fastest growing areas in the country as a result of physical and residential development.</P>
    <P>The St. John of God Carmona Services, which is the main service provider for people with mental handicap in the south east region of Dublin, currently provides services to 303 people &ndash; 244 on a daily basis and 59 in residential care. That service is facing a major crisis as it is unable to meet the huge demands being placed on it, particularly for residential care. There is an unacceptably long waiting list and the waiting period can be as much as ten years.</P>
    <P>The current numbers on the waiting list are as follows: 97 for residential places, 180 for respite care, 25 for crisis places and 22 for day services. This service received £250,000 out of the Minister's millions. That will provide five residential places, from a waiting list of 97, and five day places from a waiting list of 22. Incidentally, those waiting lists might be understating the real demand since many people who are aware of them and are aware of the length of waiting time to get a residential place, give up in despair and do not apply.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a meeting in Dunmore House in Glenageary regarding the funding allocation. I had previously attended a similar meeting with other public representatives before the budget at which there was great expectation that the Government would deliver on its pre-election promises and its programme for Government. At the second meeting it was most disappointing to see the staff and the parents and carers of people with disability absolutely devastated.</P>
    <P>The staff and parents in that service are worn out by the burden of care and the drudgery of fund raising. It leaves them with little energy for the type of lobbying that appears to be necessary to get the Government's ear. What energy they have left is rapidly converting to anger. They wonder what they must do to get the type of attention on-course betting, major sports organisations and other, more powerful and active lobbies received in the budget.</P>
    <P>The £65 million which is sought to deal with this problem is not an enormous sum. It can be provided. In my area the requirement is £7 million for the services which are necessary and approximately £2 million additional funding on an ongoing basis. It should be possible to meet that need out of the huge and unprecedented level of resources available to the Government. It is most disappointing that it is not happening.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister listing a litany of incremental measures. What is required is a firm decision on the part of Government to provide the necessary resources and to do so without <Col N="581" /> equivocation. It must be done now to ensure that the necessary construction and the provision of equipment, services etc. can be done without delay. It would provide some hope&mdash;</P>

The Government should change its position on that and provide the money necessary to facilitate the provision of the services required. This is a priority.</P>

      <P>Gura maith agat. Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom an Teachta Theresa Ahearn agus Fine Gael a mholadh as ucht an rún seo a chur síos. Tá sé in am ceart agus ba chóir don Rialtas aird níos mó a thabhairt dó seachas leasrún a chur síos. Níl an leasrún seo ag brú ar chor ar bith ar na nithe atá sa rún a chuir Fine Gael síos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Theresa Ahearn on tabling this timely and welcome motion, but I am disappointed with the Government's response to it. The Government's amendment ignores the critical issues raised. The Government should give us a detailed breakdown of what is involved in two points in its amendment. Its amendment refers to the provision of additional funding of £91.6 million. When was that funding put in place and to which period and exact services does it relate? Its amendment also refers to arrangements being put in place to meet the educational needs of children with special needs. I find that reference extraordinary because I spoke about this issue during the passage of the education Bill through this House. For our education system to be available in an integrated way for all people with disabilities, it is vital to ensure teacher training includes a component on disability, which it does not include currently. It is <Col N="582" /> ludicrous that teachers who want to avail of such courses have to pay for them out of their own pockets.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister for Education and Science at that time to ensure all members of the inspectorate have a minimum knowledge and expertise in areas that relate to the disabled and to children with special needs in education. I am not sure to what the amendment refers, but it does not reflect the real position. It is ludicrous that some remedial teachers have to provide a service for five or six schools in some rural areas. Teacher training at primary or secondary level does not have a component which would prepare teachers to deal with children with special needs whether they be physical, intellectual or whatever. This amendment rings very hollow to me. It does not describe a situation that will improve substantially in the short or medium term.</P>
    <P>There is very little knowledge about learning disorders, such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD, in the education system. I am sure every Member is aware of the distress suffered by the parents of these children and their feeling of alienation and abandonment by the education system because these issues are not being addressed. The section of the amendment, which gives the impression that substantial arrangements are being put in place for the education needs of children with special needs, is misleading and rings hollow.</P>
    <P>In their programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats gave an explicit commitment to fund the necessary services called for in the Report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &ndash; A Policy for the Intellectually Disabled and the report, Towards an Independent Future. As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore said, the Labour Party is committed to the full implementation of the recommendations of these critical reports, but the evidence of a wide range of groups and non-governmental organisations suggests the Government has failed to honour many of its commitments. One has only to read the newspapers or listen to the radio to know at first hand how far away the Government is from putting its commitments into practice.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was launched in November 1996. An interdepartmental committee to oversee the implementation of its recommendations was put in place to bring forward a report to a monitoring committee, which was immediately established. This monitoring committee was established but it has not met for almost 18 months as it is awaiting the report of the interdepartmental committee and the costing of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The committee hired to cost the commission's recommendations began work in late 1997. In March 1998 it met the Irish Council for People <Col N="583" /> with Disabilities as part of the consultation process it was undertaking. Nothing has been heard since despite its meeting with the Irish Council for People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers to £91.9 million, but I would like to know where that money has been allocated. Ireland has never had it so good. The Minister for Finance is taking in a record amount of tax receipts and people with disabilities ask that they and their carers should be given no more than a fair share of the surplus available to the Government. This year the current budget surplus will be £1.3 billion. It is necessary to use a proportion of that money to provide a basic level of service for those who have been ignored.</P>
    <P>There will be a deficit of people with the necessary qualifications and expertise to provide the required caring services unless the Government decides to address this problem by providing the necessary training, whether it be, training in nursing or training for carers or for providers of support services at whatever level. If we do not have the necessary trained people, it will not matter what funds, capital or buildings are available. Unless we have people qualified to deliver the necessary quality services we will not achieve the objective of this motion. The Government must give a commitment that it will ensure a flow of qualified people will be available to enable services to be provided to cater for those who are in need.</P>
    <P>As the parent of an intellectually disabled child, I know that people with an intellectual or physical disability can have a relatively dignified and independent existence in a home setting, but what happens to those children when their parents are no longer there? What does the future hold for them? My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, quoted figures on this. The parents of these children are growing old and many of them are in a state of torment wondering what the future will hold for their children when they depart this life. The issue of training and the expansion of personal assistance services for people with physical disabilities needs to be addressed.</P>

      <P>It gives me no pleasure to raise the matter of a further factory closure in Tipperary town. Last Friday morning, Namco Ireland Limited announced the closure of its manufacturing plant with the loss of 42 jobs. Perhaps the loss of 42 jobs is not very important to the Government, taking into account some of the job announce<Col N="584" /> ments recently made by the Tánaiste. However, in comparative terms, the loss of 42 jobs in Tipperary town is the final nail in the coffin of a town which has staggered from one closure to another.</P>
      <P>As the company has stated, its share of the traditional games market has declined in the past few years as the technology gap between commercial and consumer games closed dramatically. This has arisen from the huge penetration of personal computers and highly sophisticated games software. Apart from job losses in other parts of the county, the litany of losses sustained in Tipperary town include the 7-Up soft drinks company, O'Doherty and O'Dwyer, Irish Pride bakery, Mass Mutual and Tambrands Ireland Limited. Mass Mutual has been replaced by Continental Promotions and Tambrands by Pall Corporation. However, these replacement companies, welcome as they are, are still in the process of getting into full employment mode, leaving a large number of unemployed people in Tipperary town. It is a shame that during this economic boom and the Celtic tiger, good workers who have excellent relations with their employers are forced to travel to Clonmel or Limerick which necessitates a 50 mile round trip.</P>
      <P>Last Friday morning I met with the directors of Namco, including Michael Nevin and John McKenzie, the managing director and financial controller of Namco Europe respectively, and Patrick Pickham, the general manager of the Tipperary plant. I am pleased they have agreed to allow their facility to be marketed by the IDA. I do not have to tell the Minister, as the Tánaiste has already issued a statement, that this is one of the most excellent facilities available to the IDA and the Government. It is a magnificent facility and I thank the outgoing company for maintaining it. It has installed a security system to ensure the factory is not vandalised. It has ensured the continuation of heating, lighting and cleaning so that when the Minister, through the IDA, brings in a prospective customer they will see an excellent facility. Any prospective company can start up there immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government to give a commitment that Tipperary town will be given the priority it deserves from IDA promotions in Europe and North America. Nothing less will satisfy the people of Tipperary town and those of us who represent them. The company agreed, in consultation with me, to enter into meaningful and, hopefully, satisfactory negotiations with union representatives. I hope they will agree to a fair redundancy package to compensate for the loss of jobs. Many employees have worked for this company for more than 20 years. The closure has created and will create problems for Tipperary town. Every stop needs to be pulled out so Tipperary town will not be neglected and left on the industrial heap by the Government or the IDA. <Col N="585" /> This closure is not the fault of workers or the company.</P>

Deputy Ferris did not exaggerate the tragic consequences of the loss of 42 jobs to the economy of the town. Tipperary has suffered more than its share of job losses. This must be the priority of the IDA. I trust that the plea made by Deputy Ferris and myself will enable the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to put Tipperary on the top of the agenda. We hope we will be able to report to the devastated workers that the Government will make every effort to get a replacement industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the constructive contributions of both Deputies. I apologise for the absence of the Tánaiste. We were all greatly disappointed at the recent announcement by Namco Ireland that it will close its Tipperary plant which is engaged in the manufacture of amusement centre video games, with the loss of 50 jobs. This decision has resulted from the loss of its contract to supply its main customer, WMS, with Atari product. This product represented 60 per cent of turnover in the Tipperary plant.</P>
      <P>The Atari corporation established an operation in Tipperary in 1978 and one in Limerick in 1982. At that time they were world leaders in video games and home computers. Over the years, the company lost market share to the more sophisticated Sony and Sega products. This resulted in the downsizing of the Tipperary plant and the closure of the Limerick plant.</P>
      <P>Atari was bought by two successive owners and finally by WMS in Chicago, which is in the same business. Namco corporation, a $500 million dollar business with global leisure interests, purchased the manufacturing facility in Tipperary from WMS and a contract was agreed to continue to supply the Atari product to Europe on its behalf. In addition, Namco manufactured some of its own product for Europe in the Tipperary facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Following the loss of the WMS contract, the only remaining production in the County Tipperary facility was Namco's own product, the volume of which would not be sufficient to maintain the operation. IDA Ireland requested that Namco consider the option of making Ireland its principal European manufacturing base. However, despite IDA Ireland's best efforts, in discussion with the company and at meetings with the Japanese owners regarding the various options, Namco has decided that the only option is to close the facility. Namco previously closed its UK manufacturing facility with a loss of 40 jobs.</P>
    <P>In response to the announcement, IDA Ireland has persuaded the company to co-operate in promoting the property for an alternative manufacturing activity. A specific marketing initiative to highlight the availability of a modern facility and skilled workforce is currently being put into action through the IDA's overseas offices. In particular, IDA Ireland is targeting the opportunities for sub-supply companies to locate in County Tipperary to service the growing number of large scale IT manufacturing operations in Ireland. I understand that IDA regional management will be meeting tomorrow with the county manager, the chairman of the county council and the chairman of the urban district council to discuss a full range of further initiatives.</P>
    <P>This and previous Governments have had significant success in the past few years in attracting new jobs to County Tipperary. In 1997 and 1998 a total of 697 and 726 jobs, respectively, were created in County Tipperary in client companies of the industrial development agencies, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the Tipperary county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>In April 1998 an expansion of 200 jobs for Clonmel Healthcare was announced. In July 1998 Guidant Corporation, a global leader in the medical devices sector, decided to establish a 518 person project over a five year period in the former Seagate facility. Guidant Corporation is progressing well, and in March 1999 the Taoiseach announced a 700 person expansion project for the company. Also, in 1998 60 new jobs were announced for Tipperary town, with an expansion of Continental Promotions. In addition, employment in Pall Corporation, also in Tipperary town, increased to 99 in 1998.</P>
    <P>I assure Members every effort will be made by the industrial development agencies to ensure a replacement industry for Namco is secured at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the crisis in child care and the impact of the child care regulations and inspections on the number of child care places available in the Dublin area and throughout the country. Yet another child care campaign has been launched today. There have been over 20 years of campaigning to try to put the issue of child care on the agenda.</P>
      <P>I was told by the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question some time ago, that 1,720 inspections of child care places have taken place throughout the country. It is absolutely clear, from information on the ground, that there is a reduction in the number of child care places. There is concern that not enough child care places are available to meet demand. People are calling child care services on a daily basis, asking where they can find a place and what supports are available to them as parents. The lack of places affects those who work full-time and part-time outside the home and those who work full-time in the home. We know from research that child care is used by families where parents work inside and outside the home.</P>
      <P>A nursery owner told me today she no longer operates a waiting list because there is no point in having one. Another owner told me she receives queries every day from frantic parents asking whether child care places are available. A mother and father who recently returned to this country told me they are considering seriously leaving again because of the lack of child care places. Another couple who returned recently from England told me they had supportive child care services available locally in England which were of high quality and affordable. They checked out 18 crèches in Dublin and were unable to find a place. When they eventually found a place they were not satisfied with it.</P>
      <P>I want to bring it to the House's attention that this situation is placing great stress on families. The Irish Pre-School Playgroup Association said today that 2,000 places have been lost recently. We are facing a serious situation. If this were an agricultural, fodder, training, industrial relations or any other sort of crisis, the Government would not be as complacent as it appears to be.</P>
      <P>Providers must get support to implement the regulations and grants. These grants should apply to those who have already made the effort, as well as to those who have not yet brought their crèches to the standard rightly demanded by the regulations. Compliance with the Act costs money and the industry and parents can no longer afford full compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, there are issues of concern with regard to child care at present, namely, quality, quantity and qualifications. There is a major problem finding staff willing to <Col N="588" /> work in this area. Training is also a problem. We must address this urgently and seek consistency of standards in the area. Many crèches have not yet registered with the health boards.</P>
    <P>Quality child care in this country, particularly in the Dublin area, is moving beyond the reach of many parents. The consequences of this are extremely serious, particularly for children. If parents have to move children from quality child care to other services with low standards, as they are doing, we can imagine the consequences and scandals we will have in years to come. This is at a time when we say we care very much about children and in light of the experiences of the past.</P>
    <P>About 600,000 Irishwomen are in paid employment today. About 46 per cent of children under four years and 25 per cent of full-time working mothers use child care facilities. It is projected that a further 218,000 women will rejoin the labour force in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Child Care 2000 campaign asked today for a number of points to be considered, including an allocation of £3 million for the establishment of national and local co-ordination of child care; a national child care committee; county child care committees &ndash; which were first recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women five years ago; £2 million for the upgrading of premises and an information campaign to help providers. These issues must be seen as a priority. I ask the Minister of State to get the Government to agree to introduce an emergency package of measures to deal with this crisis. That is the least that is called for at the moment, given the scenario I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for her interest in this subject. I know of her ongoing concern about this and I share many of the sentiments she expressed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the introduction of the child care regulations, which are determined to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services, to improve standards throughout the sector and to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children. I am the first to acknowledge that the implementation of those regulations has had a significant effect on crèche and playschool owners. The fact that we are implementing much more stringent standards brings added pressures because of the reduction in numbers, the need for an increased staff to children ratio and the need to improve the standard of playschool facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that everybody, without exception, has welcomed my initiative in introducing those regulations and ensuring standards are upheld, registrations are made with health boards and inspections are carried out. I acknowledge that, as the Deputy said, the impact of this is causing increased costs. However, the require<Col N="589" /> ment to reduce places is related mainly to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that where deficiencies are identified, I have asked the health boards and the providers to work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way, provided that any delay would not affect the welfare of children adversely. The plan may include a reduction in numbers, achieved through natural reduction &ndash; that is, not replacing children who leave during the year &ndash; reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The time scale for making improvements may vary from a requirement for immediate action if the health and safety of the children are at risk or may extend to six months if it is appropriate to use a phased approach. I have asked the health boards to be flexible in their approach to the implementation of the regulations so they do not drive people into the black market as is happening in some cases.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to expanding the availability of health care. Health boards provide financial support to pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. I have asked the health boards to get together with the other State agencies, such as local partnerships, city and county enterprise boards and the local authorities, in which there are significant difficulties with the implementation of planning regulations in a haphazard fashion, so we can respond to the difficulties now being experienced. I hope to provide a forum for all those agencies to get together in the various health board areas.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties in Dublin. I am determined to tackle those difficulties and I am determined that, between those agencies, we will put the considerable amount of money being made available this year into the creation of new places. I urge those who have difficulties to form their own groups to provide community crèches and playschools and I will try to respond with some financial support to create the extra places.</P>
    <P>This problem has arisen in the past two years. My ability to respond may not be as good as it should be; I admit that. I assure the Deputy that we are making a spirited effort to implement the regulations fairly and flexibly to create new places throughout the State. I will be holding discussions with all the health boards in the next ten days to decide a programme for extra places by September. The Government is committed to quality child care at an affordable price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express the worry and concern which exists about the Blood Transfusion Board requesting that its chief executive officer and its national medical director explore the implications to patient services of providing a single site for donation testing in the State.</P>
      <P>There are currently two sites, one in Cork and one in Dublin. It is feared by medical staff in Cork that it is the preferred option to close the donation testing centre in Cork, thus downgrading the facility there.</P>
      <P>I understand that no report has been produced yet and no decision has been made. If such a report recommended the downgrading of the Cork facility, hospital staff in Cork have told me that it would have dire consequences for patient care. Some newspapers have reported that patients' lives could be put at risk by such a move. Recently a newspaper carried a letter signed by more than 40 doctors and consultants in the Cork University Hospital which outlined the negative impact of such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The hospital deals with all acute services in the southern region. Services are provided at that hospital which are not available in any other hospital in the State. It has a good relationship with the Blood Transfusion Service Board in Cork. Even the hint of a move to downgrade such a service has led to warnings of the risks to patients' lives. The proposed move is seen as financially driven rather than based on scientific or social imperatives. There is no scientific or medical evidence available which justifies the downgrading of the service. Samples which had to be tested in Dublin would be one day in transit. Platelets have a limited life span and this day is vital.</P>
      <P>Cork provides a back up service to Dublin which has been called upon on many occasions. Waterford is served by Dublin but on several occasions lately Cork has had to provide a service which Dublin was unable to provide. Now we are told that if the Cork service is downgraded, Belfast and Edinburgh will be used as back up. Why would this be necessary when there is a perfectly reliable facility in Cork? Why withdraw something which is working well? Blood from Amsterdam had to be brought to Dublin last year because Dublin could not provide its own supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On four occasions last month, 40 to 60 pints of blood were required in the hospital. The Blood Transfusion Service in the area arranged for extra clinics so the blood could be provided that day. It is not only Cork University Hospital which will be affected, all hospitals in Cork are concerned about this proposed move and have expressed their concerns strongly. They say that their medical opinions have not been taken on board and <Col N="591" /> they were not consulted during the preparation of this report. Why were the providers of medical services in the region not consulted? Why did 40 of them feel it necessary to express their sentiments in a national newspaper? It is alarming to me, as a layman, at a time when there is low confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, that the service in Cork is being undermined.</P>
    <P>There has been an outcry from the consultants and staff of Cork University Hospital and I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to their request for a meeting. It is alarming that so many medical staff do not agree with such a move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the Blood Transfusion Service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Following the report of the Finlay tribunal of inquiry, the BTSB is in the process of implementing a wide ranging programme of modernisation to adapt to emerging developments in blood transfusion. Measures to further improve blood safety are being introduced this year. The cost of the new measures will be £6.8 million in 1999, resulting in the price of one unit of red cells increasing from £63 to £94. A new IT system is also being introduced at a cost of £4 million. At the Cork centre, the BTSB recently completed the refurbishment of the component processing and compatibility testing laboratory at a cost of more than £500,000.</P>
      <P>Transfusion medicine is undergoing rapid change. New technology and additional safety tests continue to emerge. The BTSB assesses these developments to ensure its practices are in line with the highest international standard and consistent with efficiency and effectiveness. One such development is PCR testing, which has been introduced on the advice of the medical consultant to the board following the evaluation of international best practice. PCR testing is the most sensitive way of testing for viruses in blood donations and requires expensive, high grade laboratory technology and expert technical support.</P>
      <P>In February 1998, the BTSB decided, having regard to international practice, PCR testing at both Dublin and Cork centres could not be justified. It was decided, therefore, that PCR testing of all donations would be carried out at the new national headquarters of the BTSB currently under construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal now being assessed by the BTSB is whether all serological testing and not just PCR testing should be performed at the national headquarters. The board of the BTSB has asked the chief executive officer and the National Medical Director to prepare a report on the practical implications for patient services of developing a single site for donation testing in Ireland. Among the issues being addressed are: how best to provide a transfusion service in the light of the rap<Col N="592" /> idly changing environment in transfusion medicine; the application of accepted international standards of practice in leading centres and blood services; the achievement of the goal of the organisation in supplying 100 per cent of hospital blood components on time and without fail; how best to prepare for a substantial reduction in the use of blood components given the alternatives to blood transfusion which are currently available and being developed; the concerns of health boards and hospitals, including their concerns about the substantial increase in the costs of BTSB products; and the achievement of a service that is efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, the chief executive officer and the National Medical Director are consulting international transfusion experts.</P>
    <P>I will now respond to a number of misleading statements which have appeared in the media recently. I assure the House that the closure of the BTSB Cork centre is not on the agenda of the BTSB or my Department. All that is being considered is a possible change in one aspect of the Cork operation. There is not any suggestion of change in relation to the other scientific and technical services currently carried out at the Cork centre such as blood grouping, components processing, compatibility testing and ante-natal screening.</P>
    <P>With regard to claims that patients' lives will be put at risk as a result of the proposed changes, the BTSB says there is no evidence to suggest that life-saving operations in hospitals throughout the country will be affected by having one national testing centre. The BTSB points out that there are many acute hospitals in the country which are a considerable distance from a blood testing centre and this, of itself, does not pose a threat to patient safety. It has also been suggested that the removal of testing operations from the Cork centre would delay the supply of blood components to hospitals in the region. The BTSB rejects this and points out that, at any given time, 75 per cent of blood stocks are held by hospitals, with the remainder being stocked at the BTSB facilities in Dublin and Cork. There is no proposal to change this policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important and timely matter on the Adjournment this evening. Scientific research, which came into the public domain this week, casts a serious question mark over the health risks posed by mobile telephones. I do not want to exaggerate the risks. However, it is now fair to say that the jury is out regarding the possible health risks of mobile telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new evidence demands a response from the Government, the telecommunications industry and the office of the Director of Tele<Col N="593" /> communications Regulation. The safety of Irish consumers must be of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>We are entering a new phase in telecommunications with the advent of the liberalised market. The liberalised market is not a free for all, it is regulated. Companies who are granted licences are expected to operate to certain standards which protect the Irish mobile telephone users, who number almost 1 million, from possible health risks.</P>
    <P>In this respect the Government has a key role. It should lay down the public policy priorities under which the Director of Telecommunications Regulation shall perform her important functions. However, after seeing the Minister for State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Treacy, on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night, it is clear that the Government will bury its head in the sand on this important public health issue. I was genuinely taken aback at the grossly complacent attitude of Deputy Treacy. Perhaps the Minister is too busy glad-handing voters from Glenties to Glenamaddy to comprehend the seriousness of the issues before him. The Minister's position, that the Government will do nothing until conclusive, incontrovertible proof is available, is a shocking dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The incontrovertible proof on which the Minister claims he is waiting is proving elusive. It could well take a decade before proof of this nature is available. In the meantime the Government should take action to minimise the risk that mobile telephones may cause. If it does not do so then thousands of people may contract serious illnesses in the meantime.</P>
    <P>There is now a serious question mark over the safety of mobile telephones. The Government should insist that the telecommunications industry faces up to its responsibilities and ensures that any possible risks to consumers are minimised.</P>
    <P>Three steps should be taken immediately. All mobile telephone users should be offered a hands-free set paid for by the mobile telephone industry. All new mobile telephones should be sold with a hands-free set. All mobile telephone users should be issued with a health and safety guide, which is compiled by a panel of independent experts and distributed by the phone companies. These steps will reassure the public, maintain public confidence in mobile telecommunications and show that the Government is concerned by the recent research.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications industry, not the consumer, should foot the bill for these initiatives. For example, hands-free sets are strongly recommended by scientists who study mobile telephone radiation. However, if I walked into a high street shop tomorrow to purchase such a set, I would be lucky to get one for £40. In <Col N="594" /> that transaction I would pay a substantial mark-up to the manufacturer, the distributor and the retailer. This could be curtailed if the telephone companies were required to provide these sets.</P>
    <P>We cannot stand idly by while a possible risk to the health of people exists. We must move to ensure that the preventative measures which reduce the possible risks from mobile telephones are instituted while we await comprehensive scientific results. The complacent attitude displayed by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Treacy, is not good enough and I urge the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to take the matter into her own hands and ensure that action is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter. I am aware that there is some public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from mobile telephones.</P>
      <P>The Department of Public Enterprise monitors all significant research in this area and my Department, the Department of Health and Children, liaises with that Department regarding the human health aspects. Medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments. The latest research in regard to a possible link between radiation from mobile telephone hand sets and an increased risk of brain tumours in users will be assessed in that context.</P>
      <P>I am advised that there has been a considerable body of research carried out internationally on possible adverse health effects from non-ionising radiation associated with telecommunications systems. The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a conclusive link between this form of radiation and ill-health. Nevertheless while it has not been possible to determine a definite link neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship. For this reason it is advisable that we should take all such reports seriously and carefully examine them. The latest research will be incorporated into the existing body of scientific research and will also be examined by the broad scientific community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research in this area is ongoing and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the International EMF Project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electro-magnetic fields. There has been an increase in the number and diversity of sources of electro-magnetic radiation, including mobile cellular phones. This project is being carried out over a five year period and will bring together current knowledge and available resources of key <Col N="595" /> international and national agencies and scientific institutions in order to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments. From the public health viewpoint, if conclusive evidence emerges that radiation from mobile phones is causing an unacceptable public health risk, I would seek to have appropriate remedial measures put in place by the Government and agencies with direct responsibility in the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Many people share the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Shea. We must be vigilant in our approach to new technologies such as mobile phones to ensure they do not pose a health risk in the future which may lead to serious problems.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 May 1999.</P>

      <Quest>if he will impose a more reasonable penalty for errors when completing the herd register of bovine animals and animals remedies record in view of the fact the register is restrictive, time consuming and difficult for farmers to complete and the proposed penalty impositions for human error are too harsh.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13099/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh): Since 1996 herdowners have under EU legislation been required to keep herd registers of all cattle on their holdings. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 820/97, they have been required to record additional information since 1 January 1998 in relation to animal movements to and from their holdings.</P>
    <P>The herd register is an essential element of the cattle traceability arrangements that have been put in place throughout the EU to provide the assurances demanded by consumers. From a national viewpoint, these traceability arrangements are vital in protecting the export interests of the Irish beef industry.</P>
    <P>EU legislation provides for a range of penalties to be applied in cases of non-compliance with identification and registration requirements including situations where the herd register is not properly maintained. These measures include loss or reduction of premia and other payments and restrictions being placed on the movement of animals to and from holdings.  As these sanctions are set down in EU Regulations, they apply equally to herdowners in all member states of the Community. It is not open to me to modify these penalties.</P>
    <P>In practice, the proper completion of the on-farm register is checked during inspections and where non-compliance with the identification and registration requirements is relatively low the farmer is advised of the problem encountered with non-compliance and is informed that a further inspection will be carried out. However where persistent non-compliance is found the regulation requires the imposition of penalties under the premia and headage schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition to headage and premia penalties, failure to comply fully with identification-registration requirements, including the maintenance of the register, may result in loss of entitlement to other payments, to restrictions being placed on movements to or from holdings and-or to prosecution.</P>
    <P>As regards animal remedies, the position is that the maintenance of records which is provided for in EU and national legislation, is an important element in the chain of control designed to ensure that consumers are not exposed to illegal and potentially harmful residues. As such, I am sure that the Deputy will readily accept that it must <Col N="598" /> be completed fully and accurately by farmers each time a medicine with a withdrawal period is administered.</P>
    <P>To facilitate herdowners in meeting their obligations, my Department is in the process of supplying a consolidated herd register book to each herdowner free of charge. This book contains clear instructions as to how the records must be kept. In addition provision has been made to allow the records to be kept on certain computer packages. The information which herdowners are required to record in the herd register is relatively straightforward. If herdowners follow the instructions and maintain their registers in the correct fashion, they should not experience any difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the difficult market situation in the pigmeat sector and the consequences of this for producers. The situation is not unique to Ireland and the problems deriving from an oversupplied market are worldwide. Within the EU, I along with a number of my colleagues in the agriculture council have requested the Commission to take action both in terms of market support measures and other measures in order to alleviate the situation. There was a full discussion on the situation at the most recent Council of Ministers. I intend to maintain pressure at EU level for appropriate action.</P>
      <P>Since the market difficulties first began to have effect, I have taken action on a number of fronts. With regard to export refunds, I, along with my colleagues from other member states, secured substantial increases from the EU Commission on four occasions last year. In February of this year I followed this up by securing a further increase, when refunds for certain processed products for Russia were enhanced by 47 per cent to 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>I secured agreement from the EU Commission for the introduction of a scheme of aids to private storage, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date over 300,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been temporarily taken off the Community market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of last year the Council of Agriculture Ministers decided on a food aid package for Russia, which includes 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. This package, when concluded, will have a positive effect on the market. An Bord Bia launched an extensive promotional campaign for bacon earlier this year. This campaign was aimed at the consumer who was encouraged to buy qual<Col N="599" /> ity assured bacon. The campaign helped sales thus improving the market.</P>
    <P>A number of different meetings have been held at ministerial level with representative organisations. Since the start of the problems in the pigmeat sector my Department has been in regular contact with the organisations representing both the production and processing side of the industry and have had numerous meetings. Towards the end of last year I called in representatives of the banking organisations and the pigfeed providers who gave an assurance that every possible support would be given to their clients operating in the pig sector.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that pigmeat prices have risen by nearly 4 per cent since the beginning of the year and I am hopeful that this trend can be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that quality assurance schemes will continue to play a vital role in the future of our food industry. The demands of the marketplace are such that there is now universal recognition of the importance of quality assurance schemes as integral and important components of the entire food chain. This philosophy is underscored in the recent report of the food industry development group which indicated that potential for maximisation of the contribution of the food industry to the economy is dependent upon attention to competitiveness and market orientation and that development must be underpinned by attention to food safety, quality standards and quality assurance.</P>
      <P>Indeed, quality assurance was one of the significant topics dealt with at the world meat congress, hosted by An Bord Bia in Dublin as recently as last week. That conference was reminded of the necessity of having quality assurance schemes and accreditation measures that comply with best international practice. In this regard, I should say that the quality assurance schemes currently in operation by An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas and new schemes in preparation are constantly monitored to ensure that they continue to match the highest standard.</P>
      <P>My own Department's national beef assurance scheme, for which incidentally, the necessary legislation is at an advanced stage, must for example, as is the case in all claims made in respect of beef, whether in relation to origin, quality assurance or production methods, satisfy the provisions of the beef labelling scheme. This scheme requires that any such claims are fully authenticated and independently verified.</P>

      <P>The terms of a nationally funded scheme for the control of farm pollution were drawn up following consultations with the main farming organisations and submitted to the European Commission by my Department in February of this year. The Commission raised a number of issues in relation to the proposals in April and my Department responded to the Commission on these issues. Subsequently, officials met with the Commission earlier this month to deal with outstanding points. Most of the issues are now clarified but some further information was forwarded to the Commission within the last two weeks to allow the approval process to be completed. As a result, I am confident that the scheme will be approved in the near future.</P>

      <P>I will continue to keep the situation under close review over the coming months in conjunction with my EU colleagues.</P>
      <P>Following a finding by the WTO appellate body in January 1998, the EU was given until 13 May of this year to bring its ban on the import of hormone treated beef fully into line with WTO rules on risk assessment. In order to comply with this ruling, the EU has commissioned 17 scientific studies on the six hormones in question. At the beginning of May of this year, the Commission released the results available thus far from these studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already expressed my support for the European Commission's position that there can be no question of lifting the ban at this time. However, I believe it is important that there is <Col N="607" /> continuous dialogue between the EU and the US on this issue.</P>

The committee will be chaired by Mr. Pat O'Neill and includes a range of distinguished people with expertise in relation to agriculture and food.</P>
      <P>In addition, the National Development Plan 2000-06, which will be published later this year, will address important structural issues in agriculture and the food industry.

      <Quest>the action, if any, taken arising from the report of the EU inspection mission which found serious deficiencies in March 1998, including the possibility of fraudulent actions, at the AIBP plant in Nenagh, County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I indicated in replies to Questions Nos. 68 of 16 December 1998 and 72 of 24 February 1999, an EU Commission inspection mission to Ireland in March 1998 found certain hygiene related deficiencies concerning the loading bay, handling of seized-detained carcasses and the staining of specified risk material at the plant in question. In addition, deficiencies were found which, in the opinion of the EU inspectors, could allow for the possibility of fraud. However, it was made clear by the EU Commission, at a later meeting in Brussels, that the inspection mission had not found any evidence of actual or attempted fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission presented the reports of the mission at a meeting of the standing veterinary committee in Brussels in July 1998. No evidence of actual or attempted fraud was put forward and <Col N="608" /> no further investigations were planned. The Commission stated that health marking which was also reported to be a problem in other member states would receive particular attention during inspections of establishments.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the findings of the mission and its own ongoing review of in-plant veterinary procedures, my Department took a number of steps to further improve controls at all meat plants. These included: revised arrangements in relation to marshalling halls and loading bays in all slaughter plants, including the plant to which the Deputy refers; revised procedures for the detention of carcasses in all slaughter plants; tightened procedures for the identification, handling, segregation, staining and removal of specified risk material in all slaughter and cutting plants; revision of the procedures at local plant level in respect of the evaluation of cattle age for the purpose of facilitating commercial trade.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has been fully appraised of the actions taken by my Department following the inspection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a long-running dispute <Col N="609" /> between the EU and the US arising from the Union's ban on imports of hormone treated beef which was imposed in 1988. Following protracted proceedings, which included an appeal under the WTO, the EU was allowed up to 13 May last in order to bring the import ban fully into line with WTO rules on risk assessment.</P>
      <P>Arising from its efforts to comply fully with the WTO requirements, the EU released, at the beginning of May, the results available thus far of 17 scientific studies into the six hormones in question. The US announced a list of retaliatory measures and therefore the dispute has become more difficult and complex. I fully support the European Commissions position that there can be no question of lifting the ban at this time.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, also very conscious of the potential effect on Irish exports of the retaliatory action threatened by the US side. Given that the most recent announcement on 14 May by the US of its intended retaliatory action covering a total of $202 million in EU exports, does not give details of the products involved, it is not possible at this time to quantify how much of Ireland's total food exports of £164 million per annum to the US would be affected.</P>
      <P>I have expressed my support for continued dialogue between the EU and the US on this issue.</P>

      <P>The US announced on 14 May that it will seek authority from the World Trade Organisation to increase import duties on imports from the EU worth an estimated $202 million, if the EU continues its ban on the importation of meat to which growth hormones have been administered.</P>
      <P>The US has not yet indicated the specific list of EU products to be affected by this suspension of trade, but is expected to publish the list in early June. Until such time as this list is published, it is not possible to estimate what effect, if any, the US action will have on Irish food exports.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that discussions between the European Commission and the US are ongoing with a view to reaching a settlement of this long running dispute and I fully support the Commission's efforts in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for collecting price data at producer level and these are reported weekly to the EU Commission. Data relating to consumer prices are collected by the Central Statistics Office and published on a monthly basis. The margin between the producer price and the retail price is a function of market forces, consumer preference and the relative negotiating strengths of each sector along all elements of the food chain. It is my view that, other things being equal, lower producer prices should be reflected in lower prices at retail level. However, matters concerning consumer prices and market competition are under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that data are already collected at the various points in the food chain by various institutions and in light of existing legislation in the area of consumer protection and competition, the establishment of a pilot study as suggested is unnecessary.</P>

The outcome of proceedings under the WTO and the proposed retaliatory action by the US has clearly made the dispute more difficult.

      <P>The position is that Ireland's performance in delivering the direct payment schemes is among the best in the EU and compares very favourably with that of other member states. For most schemes Ireland rated between one and five among the 15 member states in terms of early payment in the 1997-98 scheme year. Ireland was first in the arable aid and ewe premium schemes, third in the suckler cow scheme and fifth in the special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made in implementing the Department's customer service action plan in using modern technology and in keeping documentation as simple as possible for these schemes. Application forms and helpsheets have been simplified each year in consultation with the farming bodies. In a recent oral presentation to the all-party committee on the strategic management initiative, the European Commission indicated that the forms used in Ireland were easier to understand than those used by other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct payments to farmers constituted some 56 per cent of farmers income in 1998 and this proportion is set to increase in the coming years following the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It is my objective that the improvements in delivery of these payments which has been achieved in recent years are built <Col N="613" /> on and that the service provided by my Department to farmers is efficient, fair, friendly and transparent.</P>

      <P>The provision of shipping facilities for transporting livestock is in the first instance a matter for the private sector.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year, my Department has approved four additional dedicated cattle ships. All of these have been approved for transporting cattle to the Continent while two are approved for markets further afield such as the Lebanon.</P>
      <P>This brings the total number of dedicated ships approved for the export of cattle to 16 and gives a capacity on such vessels for over 22,000 heads of cattle at 500kg weight.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the capacity for up to 30 livestock units to be carried each week on roll-on/roll-off services currently operating out of Rosslare. My Department has recently approved another vessel, the <i>M.V. Venus</i> for a roll-on/roll-off service between Cork and St. Malo. This new service, which is expected to carry nine to ten livestock units on each voyage, is planned to commence next month and is in addition to the existing two roll-on/roll-off services available from Rosslare to the Continent for livestock exporters.</P>
      <P>There has been a further dramatic surge in live exports this year with total exports to early May, 1999 amounting to 121,279, compared with 44,330 in the same period last year &ndash; a 173 per cent increase. Exports to the Continent thus far this year amount to 91,217, compared with 33,294 in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to respond without delay to all reasonable requests for inspection of vessels and will be inspecting additional ships within the next two months, which may result in a further increase in available shipping capacity.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the failure to open up live shipping markets of any consequence for Irish cattle; and the steps, if any, he now proposes in this regard bearing in mind current catastrophic prices for cattle.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of live cattle increased from 56,000 head in 1997 to 180,000 head in 1998 and have already reached 130,000 head this year. These exports are contributing to market price stability, particularly for suckler cow producers, who are generally at the more vulnerable end of the production spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While cattle prices have recovered substantially since the beginning of the year, they are, nevertheless, below the levels that prevailed this time last year. These lower prices are primarily due to the ongoing impact of the difficulties in the Russian market and the difficulties in some EU markets where consumers are showing a preference for their own domestically produced beef. However, I am confident that our beef exports to EU markets will continue to improve over the <Col N="615" /> next few months and this, in conjunction with a very active live trade should ensure a strengthening in prices.</P>
    <P>I will continue to ensure that adequate ferry capacity is available to transport cattle to EU markets. Shipping capacity continues to expand, with 16 dedicated vessels now approved by my Department to complement the existing roll-on roll-off services. In addition, last week my Department approved the <i>MV Venus</i> at Piraeus in Greece for carrying livestock trucks on the Cork to St. Malo route. It is expected that nine to ten livestock trucks will be carried on each voyage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the live trade to third country markets these have increased substantially, particularly to the Lebanon. As regards Libya, agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation last July providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the general peoples' committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
    <P>Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle. These delays are of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities, on a continuing basis, through every appropriate channel, with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice. The Libyan authorities have indicated, as recently as 1 May, that current economic conditions in Libya have resulted in the postponement of the implementation of the agreement but pointed out that they have never failed in the past to honour any agreement reached with another State. I am hopeful therefore that the agreement will be honoured and will continue to take every appropriate step to ensure this outcome.</P>
    <P>The only other traditional market for live cattle is Egypt and while it is my objective that all markets should be open to Irish cattle, it should be noted that the nature of that market has changed for Ireland. Egypt has now become the largest market for Irish beef importing 120,000 tonnes of beef in 1998, which is the equivalent of over 350,000 head of cattle.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that in the agreement reached on the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms, my major objectives of fully protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food sectors and providing a framework within which these sectors can maximise their contribution to employment and rural development have been met.</P>
      <P>Over the seven year period 2000-06, the gains to Irish farmers from the agreement will amount to £395 million. This compares with a loss of approximately £1.4 billion which would have accrued if the Commission's original proposals of March 1998 had been implemented.</P>
      <P>The differences in prices paid to producers here and in other member states are due to a variety of factors such as distance from market, customer preferences, the value and extent of processing and other local and regional market conditions. It is my intention that whatever action is open to me to eliminate any disadvantages to Irish producers, such as improved marketing and promotion, will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index, as an indicator of inflation, is designed to measure the change in the level of prices paid for consumer goods and services by the average private household in the country. In this regard the construction of the Irish CPI conforms to the highest international standards.</P>
      <P>The CPI does include changes in mortgage interest costs. These costs reflect not only changes in interest rates but also the increasing size of the average mortgage. Measurement of the latter takes into account the trend in house prices and thus these price trends are indirectly taken into account in the construction of the CPI. It should be noted that many households own their houses outright, or have long established mortgages, and thus only a very small minority of households are involved in house purchase at any given time. Therefore, the impact of recent price increases on the CPI &ndash; which relates to the average household &ndash; is limited. A wide range of other housing costs, including rents, service charges, insurance, decorating and repairs, are also covered by the index.</P>
      <P>The index covers all aspects of transport including the purchase of new and second hand cars and motor cycles, motor tax and insurance, motor fuels and spare parts. Also included are car maintenance and repair and other vehicle costs such as parking fines and parking fees. In addition public transport costs for all modes of transport are monitored by the CPI.</P>
      <P>The CSO methodology as outlined above is extremely comprehensive and compares favourably with that of other countries. Accordingly, I do not consider it necessary to ask the CSO to investigate alternative methods at this point in time.</P>

      <P>As has been made clear previously, it is the Government's intention that, in the light of the current public debate and following the European elections, in which parties will no doubt take the opportunity to set out their approaches, Ireland will join Partnership for Peace later this year.</P>
      <P>Prior to joining, a decision in favour of participation in PfP should be submitted to Dáil Éireann for its consideration and approval. The decision to be submitted to the Dáil would make clear the nature and scope of our proposed participation in PfP in appropriate terms.</P>
      <P>Participation in Partnership for Peace is based on the principle of self-differentiation: that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. The terms of our participation would be reflected in Ireland's national presentation document, which would be presented to NATO upon signature by Ireland of the PfP framework document of January 1994. Upon signature by Ireland of the framework document, Ireland would have joined PfP. Consultations with the NATO Secretariat concerning the modalities of Ireland's participation in PfP will take place at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>An information booklet, entitled Ireland and the Partnership for Peace &ndash; An Explanatory Guide, which explains in detail what participation by Ireland in PfP would entail, has been issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs under the direction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>It is possible that travellers will encounter problems at the beginning of next year because of computers in some countries not having been adapted for the year 2000. There may in some instances be disruption or breakdown of air, sea and-or land transportation; services such as heating, air conditioning, lifts, sewerage, water and-or gas; medical, hospital and-or welfare services; police, emergency and-or other security services; banks and other financial service providers and-or telecommunications.</P>

      <P>It is too early yet to be more specific as to the places where problems are likely to materialise or the nature of such problems. In consultation with our EU partners, the Department of Foreign Affairs is gathering information with a view to advising Irish people expecting to be abroad at the crucial time about precautions to take. When the situation becomes clearer the Department will issue appropriate advice.</P>

      <P>The rural development regulation which was recently adopted by the Agriculture Council as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement provides for continued support for early retirement from farming. Under the new regulation, the provisions of which will apply from 1 January 2000, the enlargement requirement in the existing scheme will be replaced by a provision linked to the improved viability of the holding transferred, and part-time farmers will be eligible to apply for the pension. The new scheme provides for possible changes in relation to the level and duration of pension payments.</P>
      <P>Detailed rules for the implementation of the regulation have yet to be agreed. The new early retirement scheme to apply in Ireland will form part of the rural development plan which my Department has to submit to the European Commission within six months of adoption of the Council Regulation.

This decision was made against a background of the receipt in the Department of a significant number of REP applications with high proportions of leased commonage land. Some of the applications were in respect of lands which were of entirely leased commonage.</P>
      <P>In order to safeguard the financial interests of the EU and the national Exchequer these applications had to be assessed thoroughly to ensure they were genuine and complied with the terms and conditions of the scheme. Consideration of the eligibility of such cases involved consultation with the offices of the Attorney General and the European Commission and the Commission concluded that payment of REP on leased commonage could not be justified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that Eurotags, Mullinahone Co-op, County Tipperary was appointed as the sole supplier of approved cattle eartags in respect of 1999 on foot of an open tendering competition conducted under national and EU procurement rules. In accordance with the terms and <Col N="634" /> conditions specified in the tendering documentation issued by my Department, the contract with Eurotags covers the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 with the possibility of an extension for a maximum of two further years.</P>
    <P>The supply arrangements for cattle eartags to apply in respect of the post 1 January 2000 period are being reviewed by my Department and will be discussed with the farming organisations at a sub-group of the Animal Health Forum in the near future.</P>
    <P>Under EU procurement rules, all tenderers and suppliers must be treated equally irrespective of their location within the Community. In these circumstances it will be open to the County Sligo company referred to in the questions, to tender on an equal footing with other firms when the next tendering competition for the supply of cattle eartags is announced.</P>
    <P>As regards the identification of sheep, proposals for the introduction of a system of tagging of sheep have been presented to the various respesentative bodies by my Department and consultations are now ongoing. Final decisions have not yet been taken as regards the system of tagging or the tag supply arrangements that will be put in place.</P>
    <P>There are no current proposals to introduce a mandatory tagging system for pigs.</P>

      <P>In January 1999 Irish pigmeat prices were £73.63/100kgs and since then, they have increased to £76.46/100kgs. This represents an increase of about 4 per cent, and I am hopeful that this upward trend will continue. Nothwithstanding that, it is true that the pigmeat sector at EU level and third countries has been going through a very difficult period since the middle of last year. This is due essentially to the fact that the market is heavily oversupplied at present.</P>
      <P>I have taken a range of actions aimed at alleviating the difficulties in the pigmeat sector. I secured increases in export refunds on four occasions in 1998, and I secured a further increase in February of this year. I also secured agreement from the EU Commission for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months.</P>
      <P>The Russian food aid programme, which involves the supply of 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat to Russia, will have a positive effect on the EU market when concluded. To date 22,000 tonnes have been exported to Russia and arrangements are currently being finalised for the supply of a further 40,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>To encourage the consumption of bacon on the home market, An Bord Bia launched the quality assured bacon promotional campaign earlier this year, which has helped sales and improved the market.</P>
      <P>The latest EU Commission forecast for the pig industry is that pig slaughterings will start to decrease later this year, and this should help to drive up pigmeat prices given the cutback on supplies.</P>
      <P>I along with a number of my colleagues in the Agriculture Council have last week requested the Commission to take action both in terms of market support measures and other measures in order to alleviate the situation. I intend to maintain pressure at EU level for appropriate action.</P>

      <P>The person named declared a forage area of 72.02 hectares on his 1998 area aid application, thereby giving a stocking limit of 144.04 livestock units. This person also had a milk quota of 55,468 gallons in 1998, which when divided by the national average yield of 897 gallons, accounts for 61.83 livestock units.</P>

      <P>The person named also applied for premium on 485 ewes (72.75 livestock units) under the ewe premium scheme.

      <P>The development of the sheepmeat industry is an ongoing process and given our self sufficiency in production of 400 per cent, expansion is critically dependent on the situation in our main export markets. An Bord Bia will continue to play an important role along side our exporting firms in improving and developing our export performance.</P>
      <P>Given that France accounts for almost three quarters of our export sales, promotion efforts will be concentrated on this market as well as on the possibility of increasing our sales in Germany and in the Nordic countries.

I believe opportunities lie in the achievement all year round product and in producing more value added fresh/chilled products.</P>
    <P>My strategy in the context of the forthcoming WTO negotiations will be to ensure that the interests of sheep producers in the European Union and especially in Ireland are protected.</P>

      <P>Ireland's reputation as a producer of fine quality food is founded on our ability to produce high quality safe food. Food safety is at the core of food quality and only when safety is guaranteed, can our potential to achieve the highest standard of quality be enhanced. Reassurances on food safety are being provided by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, working in co-operation with the relevant Government Departments and State agencies and with the food industry.</P>
      <P>Quality assurance schemes through integrated programmes involving farmers, processors, and retailers are operated by An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas. These schemes are aimed at ensuring safe, wholesome, high quality product capable of commanding a premium market position. The quality-assurance schemes currently operated by An Bord Bia apply in the beef, pigmeat and egg sectors, while An Bord Glas operates a quality auditing scheme for horticultural food products. In addition, my Department has a wide range of systems in place to boost the quality of Irish food. These span the range of commodities from breeding through to labelling of the end product. A major initiative undertaken by my Department is the national beef assurance scheme which aims to guarantee the safety of Irish beef and beef products in line with consumer demands. Drafting of the legislation is at an advanced stage and I hope to present it to the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>Promotion of our quality foods continues to be a priority, and An Bord Bia which has the statutory function of promoting, assisting and developing the marketing of Irish food has in place a comprehensive programme aimed at securing these aims and every opportunity is availed of to boost the wholesome and safe image of Irish food, whether at home or abroad.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the BSE crises in 1996 many markets outside of the EU restricted or banned imports of beef. Following in some cases prolonged negotiations, all of the traditionally important markets for Irish beef are now open. We are now focusing on some of what would have been secondary markets where market access problems persist. These markets include Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia and Syria.</P>
      <P>While there was no ban placed on Irish beef by any EU member state there was a loss of market share due to an increased consumer preference on some of those markets for their own, domestically produced, beef. While there has been considerable progress made in regaining these markets, it remains one of the major priorities for the Irish beef industry to recover and improve its presence on EU markets. The beef task force, which I have established, is examining this matter in the context of an action plan for the whole industry, right through from primary production through to processing and marketing. I am expecting the task force to complete its report very shortly.</P>

      <P>The outcome of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 represents a significant improvement on the commission's original proposals for the reform of the cereals sector. The intervention price reduction agreed was 15 per cent as opposed to 20 per cent, with compensation for half of the price reduction.</P>
      <P>Most analysts predict that due to an expected upturn in world prices, the price in the EU will not drop by the full 15 per cent. The reinstatement of a positive rate of set-aside of 10 per cent should act as a further influence on price buoyancy in the EU and on world markets. If these price forecasts prove to be correct then potential losses will be significantly reduced and could even be eliminated. The Agenda 2000 proposals will simplify the arable crops support system, will help remove uncertainty for grain growers, and will enable them to plan ahead with a reasonable degree of confidence.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the total number of animals in the national cattle herd are collected by the Central Statistics Office in June and December of each year. The estimates for June 1998 and June 1988 are as follows: June 1998, 7,797,100 cattle; June 1988, 6,604,100 cattle.</P>
      <P>The increase in the cattle population is mainly due to an increase in the beef suckler cow herd which has increased by approximately 700,000 head over the ten years period from 480,000 in 1988 to 1.220 million in 1998.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the carer's allowances, in common with other social welfare payments, is therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>The extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of income other than the carer's allowance that a recipient or the spouse has in the same tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is paid in full by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs without tax being deducted and, in order to collect any tax due, it is necessary to reduce an individual's tax free allowances by an amount equal to the amount of the carer's allowance that they receive. If an individual is jointly assessed with his/her spouse, then the combined tax free allowances of the couple will be reduced in order to collect the tax due on the carer's allowance.</P>

These arrangements have not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of transferring pensionable service to or from public bodies in Northern Ireland, the current position, is that there are no arrangements in place to cater for this. The public sector transfer scheme, which is administered by my Department, provides for the transfer of service, on a reciprocal basis, between participating organisations. Any organisation in the public or private sector (including organisations outside the State) is free to participate in the scheme provided it is prepared to accept the obligations of membership including the liability to make contributions, where necessary, towards the ultimate cost of service benefits. The European Commission is, to date, the only organisation outside the State with whom a transfer arrangement has been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of transferability of superannuation rights with organisations outside the State is kept under review. While I have to point out that there are major differences between our transfer of service arrangements and those which apply in <Col N="645" /> Northern Ireland, I will, of course, be happy to respond favourably to any workable proposals which emerge in this area.</P>

I also refer him to Parliamentary Questions on this issue which I answered on 20 April, 27 April, 18 May and 19 May 1999. I can confirm that I have no plans to include blind people in the list of those eligible for benefit under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present medical criteria for access to the scheme relate essentially to disabilities which seriously and permanently impair the physical <Col N="646" /> mobility of the person concerned. This reflects the origins of the scheme as a relief for disabled persons who were confined to wheelchairs, but nevertheless, were capable of driving suitably adapted motor cars.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme is being undertaken by the inderdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The existing medical criteria for qualification is one of the issues that have been raised with that group. I await this report. The current scheme is costly and opening it up to wider ranges of disabilities would significantly add to this cost. I must caution, therefore, against an expectation that a broader range of persons who suffer from some form of disability or disablement will be admitted to the scheme as a result of this review.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the new urban renewal scheme legislated for in the Finance Act, 1988. My Department formally notified the EU Commission of the business elements of the scheme on 17 September 1998 after having already discussed it with the EU Commission on a number of occasions earlier in the year. The Commission responded on 17 November 1998 with a request for a substantial amount of additional information. The matter was discussed with the EU Commission at a meeting in mid-February and a detailed reply was sent to the commission in early March. The commission <Col N="647" /> wrote again on 24 March 1999 with a further request for additional information and a reply was sent to this letter on 24 May 1999. The discussions with the EU Commission have been quite protracted and are affected by the delay in obtaining EU approval for the new regional State aids map for various Irish regions, including the new regional aid intensity ceilings. It appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the scheme will be approved by the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>Probate tax was introduced in 1993 in order to increase the yield from capital taxation by applying a relatively modest charge on a wide base to estates passing on inheritance. Probate tax is charged at a rate of 2 per cent on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased, whether the assets pass under a will or intestacy. The yield from probate tax for the past two years is as follows: 1997, £17.0 million; 1998, £19.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estates with a taxable value of £11,250 or less are exempt from probate tax. This threshold is indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index. Outstanding debts of the deceased, as well as funeral expenses, may be deducted as expenses of the estate in arriving at the taxable value. There is full exemption for the spouse and also for the share of the family home passing to dependent children or dependent relatives. Jointly-owned property which passes automatically from one joint owner to another joint owner is not subject to probate tax. Agricultural land and buildings may be reduced in value by 30 per cent for probate tax purposes. There are other <Col N="648" /> exemptions for pension benefits, charitable bequests, heritage property and the proceeds of section 60 insurance policies, which are used to pay inheritance tax/probate tax.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have discretion to allow for deferred payment of the probate tax in situations of illiquidity or hardship. For example, payment by instalment may be arranged, including waiver of interest on late payment where appropriate. Each beneficiary can claim his or her portion of the probate tax as an expense in calculating the value of the benefit for the purposes of inheritance tax, if any, under the capital acquisitions tax code.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the generous reliefs and exemptions that apply, the very modest rate of tax and the special arrangements which cater for problems with payment, it is considered that the provisions of the probate tax strike a fair balance between the need to ensure a broader distribution of the tax burden and the need to take due account of ability to pay. Consequently, I have no plans to abolish this tax.</P>

Under the first and second phases of the scheme emergency dental treatment is available to all adult medical card holders. Procedures available under the emergency scheme include extractions, restorations, denture repairs, endodontic procedures and other necessary treatment to control pain, haemorrhage and the sequelae of trauma where urgent treatment is needed. Full denture treatment is available to all edentulous, adult people with no natural teeth. Routine treatment is available to all adults in the 16 to 34 age group and the 65 years and over age group.</P>
      <P>My intention is to extend routine dental treatment under the dental treatment services scheme to persons with medical card entitlements in the 35 to 64 age group later this year.

I have made additional funds available this year to health boards to provide for this development.</P>

At the request of the Irish Nurses Organisation I extended the terms of reference of the forum in order to require it to consult extensively with nurse tutors who have been involved in the development and delivery of the nursing registration/diploma programmes. The forum has been meeting on a regular basis since its establishment last January. I do not propose to appoint additional members to it.</P>

      <P>As part of budget 1996, the then Government announced that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo;  Persons on the live register for at least one year, who take up paid insurable employment were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back-to-work allowance, community employment, jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons. The implementation of the budget provision is a matter for health board chief executives, who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 149, 158, 173, 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>At its meeting today, the Government approved the text of a draft order providing for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to investigate the infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. The tribunal will also investigate the circumstances of the infection with HIV of the person known as &ldquo;the Kilkenny health worker&rdquo; following a blood transfusion in July 1985 and the circumstances surrounding the issue of untested platelet concentrates in December 1985, the donor of which was subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive.</P>
      <P>Due to the special position held by the Irish Haemophilia Society in that it represents persons directly affected by the HIV and Hepatitis C contamination of blood products, my officials and I have been in consultation with the society in relation to the issues to be examined by the tribunal. It appears that most blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs with Hepatitis C and HIV were manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in the USA, some based on blood donated there and some based on blood donated in Ireland and sent for processing. In order to fully investigate the source of the infections the IHS felt that the tribunal should, if possible, inquire into the relevant operations of the pharmaceutical companies concerned.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to take advice from counsel here and consult with attorneys in the United States in relation to this matter. The advice received indicates that an Irish tribunal would face considerable difficulties in attempting to investigate the actions of companies or agencies based outside the State. I am advised that as a tribunal of inquiry is not a court, it is most unlikely that US courts would be able to assist by enforcing discovery orders or compelling the attendance of witnesses.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the legal advice, the proposed terms of reference include a provision which would enable the tribunal to investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant in so far as the tribunal considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so and considers that the procedures adopted for the purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General and I met representatives of the society and its legal advisers on Friday 21 May. The IHS indicated that it was satisfied that the proposed terms of reference comprised all the issues which they wish to have examined by the tribunal. The IHS also indicated its support for the provision relating to the international aspect of the tribunal. At its meeting this morning, the Government also approved the moving of the necessary motion in the Dáil and Seanad to establish the tribunal. I will ask the Chief Whip <Col N="655" /> to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department has no information as to whether the Trivax vaccine batch numbers referred to by the Deputy were administered in Ireland in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, correspondence is continuing with Glaxo Wellcome Limited, the successor to the company which produced the Trivax vaccine, in an effort to establish whether vaccine from batch 3732 and batches 3753 to 3797 might have been distributed in Ireland and, if so, whether the relevant lot numbers are available.</P>
      <P>Glaxo Wellcome has previously indicated to my Department that a variety of tests were used to analyse Trivax in the late 1960s and that all batches of Trivax released for sale complied with the mandatory requirements at that time. The company added that the results of all tests, mandatory and otherwise, together with expert advice which the company had sought, indicate that no other batch gave rise to the same level of potential concern as batch 3741.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available the Eastern Health Board has not been able to undertake a detailed examination of individual vaccination records for the period concerned. The information available indicates that in the board's area adverse reactions were noted in 73 children who were recipients of vaccine from the lots quoted. The number of children involved in each case was as follows: Lot 84019, 9 children; Lot 84657, 25 children; Lot 84769, 39 children.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to classify these cases as to whether they were serious or non-serious, as it would appear that few, if any, were reported at the time to the National Drugs Advisory Board, now the Irish Medicines Board, which has a system of classification of the adverse reactions notified to it. It is known that four of the cases referred to above involved the hospitalisation of the child and as such would usually be classified as serious adverse reactions.</P>
      <P>In so far as the other health boards are concerned, one board, the North-Western Health Board, has indicated that 41 children were vaccinated with Trivax, lot number 84657 in 1972/3 and that there are no records of any severe reactions in these cases. The Midland Health Board has indicated that it is unable to locate any records for the period concerned. The Western Health Board has not identified any records of usage of the vaccine numbers quoted. The board indicates that there are a number of records against which there are no batch numbers shown. The Mid-Western Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board, the South-Eastern Health Board and the Southern Health Board have all indicated that an extensive examination of records would be necessary in order to ascertain whether vaccine from the lot numbers in question was used and that this was not feasible in the time available. The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that from 1972 to 1973 four suspected adverse reaction reports associated with the use of Trivax were notified to the board. No information was provided to the board as to the vaccine batch or lot numbers in these cases.</P>

      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is not available on a routine basis in my Department. I have asked the chief executive officer of each of the health boards to compile the information sought and to communicate it to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>The majority of people with diabetes suffer from non insulin dependant or type II diabetes. As this type of diabetes usually affects the over 40s it is likely that we will see an increase in the number of cases as the age of our population increases. Ireland is a signatory to the St. Vincent Declaration, a World Health Organisation declaration which sets outcome targets that aim to reduce major health problems relating to diabetes in both adults and children. At present, a task force is looking at what needs to be done in order for Ireland to comply with the declaration. The report of the task force is expected shortly and any recommendations in that report will be acted upon.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of last year I gave assistance, through the national lottery, to the Barretstown Gang Camp towards the establishment of camps for both children and adolescents to help them learn to manage their diabetes. The Health Promotion Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, includes diabetes as one of the public health issues to be addressed. The document states that this will be done by raising awareness in the population and among healthcare professionals of the opportunities for the prevention of the complications of diabetes and of diabetes itself; promoting independence, equity and self-sufficiency for all people with diabetes; reducing morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease in diabetics by rigorous programmes of risk factor reduction. Since 1992 the health promotion unit of my Department has supported the development of health promoting materials, a national radio awareness campaign and resource materials for teachers.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. As also recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.</P>
      <P>An additional 13 new speech and language therapy posts have been created from development funding made available in 1997 and 1998.

The setting of priorities for the development of services, including speech and language therapy services, in 1999 is being discussed by the health boards with their local co-ordinating committees. Speech and language therapy continues to be identified by all health boards as a priority service for development.</P>

      <P>National statistics on the incidence of cancer are collected by the National Cancer Registry which was established in 1991. Reports for 1994 and 1995 show that the numbers of new cases of cancer diagnosed were 19,316 and 19,833 respectively. A longer time period will be required before any definitive statements can be made regarding national trends in cancer incidence using cancer registry data.</P>
      <P>Mortality data shows that while actual numbers of deaths from cancer appear to be increasing slightly, this is more to do with changes in the age structure of the population rather than an actual increase in cancer deaths. The calculation of age-standardised death rates for cancer show a gradual decrease over recent years. The following table shows this data for the years 1988 to 1997.</P>
      <P>The studies in the United States to which the Deputy is presumably referring are contained in a recent publication of the journal of the National Cancer Institute. The figures show a decline in the incidence rates for six out of the ten leading cancer incidence sites in males, and a similar decrease for females, except for lung cancer. This trend reversed a pattern of increasing incidence rates in the United States from 1973 to 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>The question of reviewing the brief for the phase 2B development of Longford/Westmeath general hospital and drawing up a programme for carrying out the work involved is a matter for the Midland Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There are 52 surgical and 57 medical beds in Longford/Westmeath general hospital at present. During the period November 1998 to February 1999 all beds were open except for a three week period from 14 December 1998 when 17 beds were closed. The percentage occupancy for the year 1998 in the surgery beds was 49.78 per cent and in medical beds 119.44 per cent. This medical bed occupancy reflects the fact that most emergency admissions are medical patients and this would be particularly prevalent in the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's priority general hospital developments at Tullamore and Portlaoise are currently being planned, and the timing of the phase 2B scheme at Longford/Westmeath general hospital will be considered in the context of a <Col N="661" /> review of the Department's medium-term capital programme.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance is a means tested scheme that provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport in order to finance the occasional taxi journey. To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
      <P>At present there are no plans to amend the scheme. However this allowance, among others, is being considered by the interdepartmental task force examining the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The task force is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>A design team has been appointed for the amalgamation of the maternity unit on the Cork University hospital site. The proposed development will replace the existing facilities for maternity and neo-natal care in Cork city at St. Finbarr's and Erinville hospitals at a total cost of approximately £32 million. The development will consist of 110 beds, 34 cots for the neo-natal services as well as facilities for associated out-patient, education and general services.</P>
      <P>The design team have presented the project team with a draft time scale which would see the obstetric unit commissioned and ready for opening at the end of 2002. I am confident that this development, when completed, will provide the best in modern facilities for expectant mothers and newborn babies. The progression of this project demonstrates the Government's commitment to the provision of high quality health services in the Southern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with whom my Department liaises in regard to the human health aspects. Medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments. I am advised that this latest study will <Col N="664" /> be assessed in that context as will the comments made by the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Research in this area is ongoing and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the international EMF project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields. This project is being carried out over a five year period. It will bring together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions in order to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments.</P>
      <P>At EU level the Council of Health Ministers is currently considering a recommendation on the subject of public exposure to electromagnetic fields. This recommendation if adopted will establish a European wide standard which each member state will apply to its own country. The measure as currently drafted provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a system of ongoing monitoring of the ambient exposure of the public to electromagnetic fields from all sources including mobile telephone masts.</P>
      <P>Should conclusive evidence emerge that electromagnetic radiation associated with mobile telephones is causing an unacceptable public health risk then I would seek to have appropriate remedial measures put in place by the Government Departments and agencies with direct responsibility in that area.</P>

While his office has managed to maintain a normal service to callers, the postal and authorisation services are somewhat in arrears. Additional resources have been provided and the postal backlog in respect of applications for certificates for post-1900 events, in particular, has been reduced from nine weeks to approximately six weeks. It is anticipated that a further improvement will be achieved by the end of this week.

      <P>There are currently 26.7 whole-time equivalent speech and language therapy posts filled in the Southern Health Board community care service. The waiting period from referral date to the beginning of therapy varies according to age and type of disorder as follows: pre-school children with language problems 6 to 12 months; pre-school and school going children with severe to moderate phonology, sound system, disorders 12 to 30 months; and children with mild phonology disorders 18 to 48 months. The waiting period for assessment in all areas is three months.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. The report recommended that 150 new speech and language therapy posts be put in place over the following ten years. Since the report was published three new speech and language therapy posts were created in 1997, one of which was in the Southern Health Board area, and ten new speech and language therapy posts in 1998, four of which are in the Southern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Another recommendation of the review group is the setting up of regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and manage<Col N="668" /> ment of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Following the report of the Finlay Tribunal of Inquiry, the BTSB is implementing a wide-ranging programme of modernisation in order to adapt to emerging developments in transfusion medicine. A number of measures to further improve blood safety are being introduced this year at a cost of approximately £6.8 million. This has resulted in a unit price increase in red cells from £63 to £94. A new IT system is also being introduced at a cost of approximately £4 million. At the Cork centre, the BTSB recently completed the refurbishment of the components processing and compatibility testing laboratory at a cost of over £500,000.</P>
      <P>Transfusion medicine is undergoing rapid change. New technologies and additional safety tests continue to emerge. The BTSB is continually assessing these developments to ensure that its practices are in line with best international standards consistent with efficiency and effectiveness. One such development is PCR testing which is being introduced on the advice of the medical consultants at the board following an evaluation of international best practice. This is the most sensitive way of detecting viruses in blood donations and requires high grade laboratories, expensive technology and expert technical support.</P>
      <P>The board of the BTSB decided in February 1998 that PCR testing at both the Dublin and Cork Centres could not be justified having regard to international practice. The board decided that PCR testing for all donations would be performed in the new national headquarters which is currently under construction. The implementation of this decision will involve blood samples from donations collected in all parts of the country being tested at the new national headquarters. In the light of that decision, the board recently decided to examine whether all serological testing and not only PCR testing should be performed at the national headquarters. I might add that there is no suggestion of any change in relation to other scientific and technical services at the Cork centre such as blood grouping, components processing, compatibility testing and ante-natal screening.</P>
      <P>Among the issues being addressed by the BTSB in its detailed assessment of the feasibility of having a single testing centre are: how best to provide a transfusion service in the light of the rapidly changing environment in transfusion medicine; the application of accepted international standards of practice in leading centres and blood services; the achievement of the goal of supplying 100 per cent of blood components on time and without fail; the likelihood of a substantial reduction in the use of blood components given the alternatives to blood transfusion which are currently available or being developed; the concerns of health boards and hospitals, including their concerns about the substantial increase in the costs of BTSB products; and the achievement of a service that is efficient and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> As part of this process, the chief executive officer and the national medical director of the BTSB are consulting with international transfusion experts. Consultation is also taking place with BTSB staff, relevant hospitals and blood users to brief them on the emerging developments, fully explain the BTSB's enhanced blood safety programme and address the needs and concerns of medical and scientific staff. A meeting has already taken place with members and staff of the Southern Health Board. The BTSB has advised the Southern Health Board that it is committed to working with all hospitals to ensure that it meets their blood component needs in a speedy, efficient and cost-effective manner consistent with the essential requirement of blood safety. The BTSB has invited scientific and medical input from hospital consultants in Cork to inform its considerations. The newly appointed chairman of the BTSB has also offered an opportunity to the Southern Health Board to make a presentation. The board of the BTSB will consider the outcome of the current assessment at its meeting in July.</P>
    <P>In response to a number of misleading statements that have appeared in the media recently, I want to assure the House that the closure of the BTSB Cork centre is not on the agenda of the BTSB or my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>With effect from 1 July 1999 the drugs cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme are being replaced by a new scheme, the drug payment scheme, which contains the best elements of the two existing schemes. The drug cost subsidisation scheme applies to individuals certified by their doctor as having a long-term medical condition necessitating expenditure of £32 per month. The new drug payment scheme is available to everyone and is not restricted to individuals within a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of the quarter before they receive a refund. This can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per <Col N="671" /> month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be easier to use than the drug refund scheme and will be more inclusive than the drug cost subsidisation scheme, bringing overall benefits to a greater number of people. While I have no plans to review the proposals at this stage, I will monitor the operation of the scheme with a view to making any adjustments necessary from time to time.</P>

I have therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the hospital to investigate this matter and reply directly to the Deputy. The Deputy will be aware that all persons attending accident and emergency departments are assessed and treated in strict medical priority order and consequently the waiting time for treatment may vary in accordance with the circumstances at the time. The Deputy may also wish to note that total attendances at the accident and emergency unit at Tallaght in April 1999 reflects a 1.9 per cent increase on the figure for April 1998. Total attendances for all the major accident and emergency departments in the greater Dublin area show an overall increase in attendances of 0.4 per cent when April 1999 is compared to April 1998. This does not reflect a significant increase in demand.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board maintains separate waiting lists for psychological assessment for children with mental handicap and for children suffering a mental illness. Assessments are carried out by clinical psychologists of the board and by a number of agencies, principally the Brothers of Charity and Cope Foundation, on an agency basis. The number on the waiting list for children with a mental handicap is 416 and 445 for children suffering a mental illness. The average waiting time varies from agency to agency. However, for mental handicap the average waiting period is in the region of one year and the waiting list for mental health services ranges from one week to two and a half years. Clients presenting with urgent issues are given priority and are usually seen within one month. The board and the Brothers of Charity have experienced difficulty recruiting additional psychologists. Efforts continue to be made to employ additional psychologists to address the waiting lists.</P>

      <P>Since taking office, I am acutely aware of the importance of reducing waiting lists and waiting times, particularly for children. To this end, my Department has allocated £20 million in 1999 to agencies for the provision of treatment to patients on waiting lists. A new policy circular and guidelines have also issued to each hospital dealing with waiting lists advising them of updated procedures in relation to the waiting list initiative. I am confident that the additional funding and revised arrangements for the management of waiting lists will have a significant impact on waiting lists and, more importantly, waiting times this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to this patient, the Deputy will be aware that the determination of in-patient appointments is a matter for the hospital authorities in the first instance, based on clinical assessment of need. I have asked the secretary-manager of Temple Street hospital to investigate the position in this case and, given the particular circumstances, I have requested that he reply to the Deputy directly, as a matter of urgency.</P>

The person appointed has a background in occupational therapy. The Midland Health Board appointed a <Col N="674" /> psychiatric nursing officer as resource officer with effect from 9 February 1999. The Mid-Western Health Board has appointed two part-time resource officers. The persons appointed have a background in research and public health and were appointed in August 1998. The North-Eastern Health Board has had a nursing officer as an acting resource officer since last year. The board hopes to fill the post on a permanent basis in the near future. The North-Western Health Board appointed two resource officers in November 1998. The positions are part-time and both persons are senior psychiatric nurses. The South-Eastern Health Board has appointed a resource officer who will officially take up the position on 31 May 1999. The person appointed is a psychiatric nursing officer. The Southern Health Board has appointed a chief nursing officer as resource officer. The appointment has been made on a part-time basis as a number of other persons are also engaged by the board in suicide and suicide prevention activities. The Western Health Board has appointed a nursing officer to the position of resource officer on a full-time basis. The position was filled in 1998.</P>

      <P>I consider that stage payments in excess of the amounts covered by the HomeBond stage payment warranty expose the house purchaser to an unacceptable degree of risk. I have placed on record my concerns regarding the level of stage payments set out in the Irish Home Builders' Association code of practice in cases where title to the site is transferred before completion of the transaction. I have also written to the association seeking assurances that members neither seek interim payments in excess of the HomeBond warranty nor seek to extend the practice of stage payments to areas where they did not previously operate. These assurances have not yet been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I have also noted the recent judgment of the District Court in Cork that the stage payments sought in the case in question were unfair. The stage payments sought in this case appear to be the level set out in the IHBA code where title to the site is transferred before completion of the transaction. I would now expect the Irish Home Builder's Association to withdraw the stage payments element of the code of practice. I will be in touch with it in this regard. My Department will also be in touch with the Director of Consumer Affairs on this issue. I would not rule out the prospect of legislation in this area if that proves necessary.</P>

      <P>Part L of the Building Regulations, which applies to the design and construction of new buildings and the reconstruction of existing buildings, sets out the legal requirements to be observed in relation to the conservation of fuel and energy. Part L applies to all categories of relevant buildings, including residential accommodation. Technical Guidance Document L &ndash; TGD-L &ndash; which accompanies the regulations, provides guidance on thermal performance standards. The guidance also deals with the means of applying insulation and selecting the thickness of insulation. In December 1997 I published a revised edition of TGD-L. The overall result of the revised guidance will be an energy saving in space heating estimated at up to 10 per cent. My Department has initiated a further and more radical review of the thermal performance and insulation requirements of TGD-L having regard to Ireland's obligations to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol by the years 2008 to 2012. I hope to be in a position to publish relevant proposals for public comment by the end of this year, following consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Body.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of March 1999 there were 11,659 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance. The estimated expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is over £59 million. Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance which was launched in October 1998 and its proposals on <Col N="682" /> the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, a range of measures were introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. The 1999 budget introduced improvements in the means test for carer's allowance. From August 1999, a disregard of £75 per week will be applied to the income of a carer who is single and the current disregard of £150 per week will be applied to the joint means of a married couple.</P>
      <P>The submissions and proposals of the organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are set out in the report. One of the major issues raised by these groups was the removal or easing of the carer's allowance means test. The review examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests associated with social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the living alone allowance of £6 per week is to recognise the extra cost of living alone. It is payable as an addition to weekly social welfare pensions to people aged 66 years of age or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments, and who reside alone. The allowance is an integral part of the Irish pension system and is designed to cover a specific contingency. As such, it has no applicability <i>vis-à-vis</i> pension payments made under the social security regimes of other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements. This is fully in accordance with the EU regulations which allow all member states to decide which benefits are granted and under what conditions.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to extend this allowance to people in receipt of a social security pension or benefit from a country covered by EU regulations or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. This does not, however, preclude low income pensioners from qualifying for the free schemes provided that they are in receipt of a qualifying payment, for example, in this instance, from another EU member state, or that they satisfy a means-test and are living alone or with certain categories of excepted people.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance. In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and they must satisfy a specified means test. A qualified child is one who falls into one of the age groups specified for the scheme and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of widow's and widowers contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple. Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable. Applications for assistance from those who do not qualify for payment under the scheme may be considered by the health board for an exceptional needs payment &ndash; ENP. The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate plans to relax the means test provisions for recently widowed parents who take up part-time employment. The income limits for the allowance are based on social welfare payments and are automatically raised each year in line with the budgetary increases. Any changes in the scheme would have to have regard to the position of other families on lower incomes who do not qualify for such a payment on the grounds of excess means. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme will be reviewed during 1999 as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations. The review will examine all aspects of the scheme including the income limits and means test. Any changes recommended in the review of the scheme will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The social welfare system includes a variety of schemes, each of which was designed to support people at various stages of their lives or when certain contingencies arise. It has been the practice to have a separate application form for each scheme type, designed to elicit concise information needed to determine entitlement to the specific payment most appropriate to the needs and circumstances of the applicant. While the basic information required to identify the applicant and, where necessary, to locate the appropriate PRSI record, is common to all schemes, the specific information required to determine entitlement to the most appropriate scheme type can differ significantly from scheme to scheme.</P>
      <P>Applications for disability benefit, for example, are made on a combined application form, also completed by a medical practitioner who certifies the nature of the illness involved. Unemployment payment claims, on the other hand, are usually completed during a visit to one of the Department's local offices and the information required relates strictly to the employment position of the applicant. Other application procedures will differ in respect of the nature of the information required, for example, those involving a means test will require details which would not be relevant in the case of contributory schemes based on the persons PRSI record. It is considered that, given the wide range of social insurance, social assistance and other types of benefits available, a single unified application form would be unduly complicated from the customers' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I note the Deputy's point that applicants contacting my Department should be provided with detailed information on their full <Col N="685" /> entitlements and not solely in relation to the specific benefit type on which the initial application may be based. My Department is committed to delivering quality customer service and to ensuring continuous improvements in the standards of service it provides. A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years aimed at improving the quality of our service to the public. These include establishing customer panels where customers meet officials regarding their needs and concerns in the area of customer service delivery, and developing a code of practice for form and leaflet design in consultation with customers and their representative organisations. Other improvements include a more widespread use of information technology to meet the needs of customers at local level and to help minimise the difficulties encountered by people wishing to access their entitlements under the broad range of schemes and supports administered by my Department.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and from last April free travel is available to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance. The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. The full year cost of free travel scheme for 1999 is approximately £34.5 million and at the end of March 1999, over 537,000 free travel passes had been issued. Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Time restrictions have been put in place because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or suburban rail services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>The widow's and widower's pension schemes recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse. A widow(er)'s (contributory) pension is based on either the claimant's own or late spouse's social insurance record. In addition, a person may use the full record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition. From June, the weekly rate of the widow(er)'s (contributory) pension, £82.10 per week for those over 66 and under 80 years of age, will be 114 per cent of the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>A widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test. From June, the maximum rate of the widow(er)'s (non-contributory) pension, at £78.50 for those over 66 and under 80 years of age, will be 109 per cent of the commission's recommended rate. Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where appropriate. Special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. The question of future improvements in social welfare provisions for widows and widowers &ndash; as for all social welfare clients &ndash; is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>An application for maternity benefit from the person concerned was received by my Department on 11 February 1999. In order to qualify for maternity benefit certain PRSI contribution conditions must be satisfied. Based on her social insurance record she has insufficient contributions to qualify for maternity benefit. Her application was, accordingly, refused by a deciding officer and she was notified of this decision and the reasons for it on 1 March 1999. Representations subsequently received from the Deputy raised an important issue in the case which required careful consideration. The points raised in these representations have now been fully considered and a full reply has been issued to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>All wild birds throughout the state are protected under the terms of the Wildlife Act, 1976. Corncrakes are included in Annex 1 of the EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC which lists species which are to be the subject of special conservation measures. Ireland is a party to an international corncrake action plan produced by Bird Life International which is supported by a number of international bodies including the Council of Europe. From a position in the first half of this century where the corncrake was widespread in Ireland the population is down to less than 200 calling males. After a number of years of decline the numbers have stabilised in the last two years. The overall decline is probably attributable to the mechanisation and intensification of agricultural practices in recent decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken to protect the corncrake. Hunting has not been permitted for a number of years. The remaining strongholds of the corncrake &ndash; the meadows of the Shannon Callows, Inishbofin and Tory Island in Donegal &ndash; have been classified as special protection areas under the EU Birds Directive. My officials are currently considering whether other areas used, or potentially used, by the corncrake can also be classified as special areas of conservation. In addition, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department together with Birdwatch Ireland operate an annual corncrake grant scheme whereby farmers who have corncrakes on their lands are offered financial incentives to operate in a manner sensitive to the needs of the <Col N="688" /> corncrake particularly when mowing their fields &ndash; the delay of grass cutting until young corncrakes are fledged. A grant of £64,000 has been approved for this scheme in 1999. Discussions are ongoing between my officials and officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food to identify modifications to the REPS so that specific corncrake sensitive measures can be included in the scheme.</P>

In March last, Dungarvan Urban District Council informed my Department of the Deputy's interest in having clearance and restoration work undertaken at the church and graveyard and requested my Department to indicate the works which it felt would be appropriate. My Department has now replied to the council requesting detailed written proposals on the nature of the works in question, on receipt of which I will arrange for a response to issue expeditiously.</P>

      <P>The decision on whether the Kells market cross should be moved to a temporary location pending the pedestrianisation of Cross Street lies ultimately with its owners, Kells Urban District Council. Dúchas, the heritage service in my Department, has advised the council that the cross should be moved as little as possible as with every move there is a possibility that it will be damaged. Accordingly, it is recommended that when the cross is moved back to Kells it should be to its final location.

      <P>The Christmas leave period arose before anything could be done about the situation but on 12 January 1999, the personnel officer transferred the official concerned.

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the vehicle in question was seized by the gardaí in accordance with Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 and the relevant regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Under Section 41 of the above Act, the gardaí are empowered to seize a vehicle if any one or all of the following circumstances are satisfied: the driver has no driving licence and is ineligible to hold one by reason of age; the driver has no insurance; and the vehicle is untaxed for more than three months. The vehicle is released on payment of a £100 fee, i.e. £75 seizure fee and £25 daily storage charge plus £25 per day thereafter.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the vehicle in question was seized for being untaxed for a period of three months or more. In addition, the vehicle was not specially constructed or adapted for use by a disabled person in which case it would not qualify for an exemption from road fund licence duty, i.e. motor tax. In the circumstances, the gardaí do not recommend a refund of the charges incurred.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of the treatment of the person referred to by the Deputy by the gardaí, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the driver was treated with courtesy at all times and made no complaint to the gardaí about the manner in which he was dealt with.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the position where parents are in dispute about access to a child following a separation agreement. The law already provides detailed provisions by way of a Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 and the Children Act, 1997 in this area. While I have no proposals for changes in the law I can say it is kept under review.</P>

      <P>However I understand that, in December 1995, prior to the establishment of my Department, the then Minister of State with responsibility for local development, then located in the Department of the Taoiseach, approved the payment of a grant of £40.000 on foot of a joint application by the Herberton Youth Club-Crumlin Academy of Music towards the development of a music academy in the youth club premises in Raleigh Square, Crumlin, Dublin 12.</P>
      <P>It appears that the promoters have, to date, failed to raise the remainder of the funding required and that the project has not started as a result.</P>

    <P>At the meeting on 5 May 1999 the monitoring committee for the URBAN Operational Programme, each of the steering groups in the three selected areas confirmed that all funding available to them had been fully allocated. In addition, significant progress was reported in respect of activity in the first four months of 1999. Planning permission is now in place for the flagship project in Ballymun &ndash; the Arts and Community Resource Centre, allocated IR£2.13 million from URBAN &ndash; the planning process for the Darndale's Village Centre &ndash; IR£1.14 million from URBAN &ndash; is under way and the Enterprise Centre in Cork is near completion.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee was also pleased to note the assurances from the steering groups and full financial allocations would be spent within the programming period which expires at the end of 2001.</P>

      <P>The health and safety authority is the body with national responsibility for health and safety matters. At the beginning of 1996, the authority issued a report of the advisory committee on occupational safety and health at first and second level schools. This advisory committee included representatives of the partners in education, my Department and other interests. While this report did not identify bullying of teachers as a widespread issue I am very concerned by recent reports of bullying and other threats to the health and safety of teachers. Teachers like other employees are entitled to be feel safe and protected from all forms of bullying and intimidation in their working environment.</P>
      <P>Under the health and safety legislation, school managerial authorities in their role as employers are responsible for ensuring the safety and health of their employees. This duty requires the drawing up a safety statement for the school in consultation with those at risk. The statement should identify potential hazards and assess the risks to health and safety.</P>
      <P>Bullying should be considered as a potential hazard and assessed accordingly. Where there is a risk to health and safety from bullying, school based measures should be devised to prevent and deal with such behaviour and create awareness within the school that bullying behaviour is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently completed consultations with teacher unions and management bodies concerning guidelines for second-level schools on the issue of violence in schools. The guidelines outline the duty of school management authorities to provide a safe environment for employees and other persons present in the school and the measures to be taken to prevent or minimise the risk of assaults to teachers and other school staff. The guidelines also give guidance regarding the measures to be taken in support of staff who have been assaulted or threatened with assault. The guidelines emphasise the importance of developing a fair and efficient code of behaviour in schools to assist in the promotion of good relations between teachers, pupils and parents. Arrangements are now being made for the issue of the guidelines to all second-level schools. Similar guidelines have already issued to primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am open to submissions from teacher and other school staff interests on the specific issue of <Col N="702" /> bullying of teachers and if there is a need to address the issue further in the form of guidance to school management, I will do so in consultation with the partners and the health and safety authority.</P>

      <P>Under the school transport scheme, recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside are eligible for transport to that centre.

      <P>The requirements in relation to Irish which are set out in Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools must be seen in the broader context of the requirements which apply to the curriculum in secondary schools generally. The curriculum of a secondary school must include instruction in a syllabus approved by the Minister in Irish as one of a number of subjects.</P>
      <P>The approved course for junior pupils in secondary schools must include a number of specified subjects, one of which is Irish.</P>
      <P>In the case of the established leaving certificate, the approved course for recognised senior pupils must include not less than five subjects from a specified list. One of these must be Irish. Both the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied have specific requirements regarding subjects to be studied. The study of Irish is a requirement for both of these courses.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that the requirements in relation to Irish have to do with the study of that subject. There is no minimum grade requirement in the case of Irish or any other subject for the award of a certificate in the junior certificate or the leaving certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>The requirements which apply to Irish and to other subjects which must be studied exist in order to ensure that pupils receive a broad and balanced education. An exemption from the study of Irish is granted subject to certain conditions which have been communicated to all schools. These apply to the children of foreigners who are consular or diplomatic representatives in Ireland, to those who have had extended periods of residency in other states and to students with certain learning disabilities. Students who are granted such an exemption may substitute another subject from an approved list of subjects for Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the academic requirements for entry to primary teacher training colleges which are <Col N="704" /> affiliated to universities, all candidates, including mature students and graduates, must have achieved, as a minimum, a grade C3 on a higher level paper in Irish at the leaving certificate examination. The reason for this requirement is to ensure that they have a sufficiently high standard on entry to meet the academic demands of the teacher training course in Irish, both oral and written, which has to equip them to teach Irish to pupils across the whole range of the primary school.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to alter the rules which apply to the study of Irish in secondary schools.

As part of this development, primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of below 10:1 and which currently have no remedial service may apply for a service where they can demonstrate the particular needs of their pupils.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to provide funding for the organisation in question.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, including children with dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support where appropriate of the remedial teacher service. The priority focus of available resources is on the development of in-school services to cater for the children in question. As part of this approach, arrangements are currently being made by my Department to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> In 1998, my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the association for children and adults with learning disabilities to assist their administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all children with special needs in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. Children with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are entitled to avail of this development. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Archbishop McQuaid junior school is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 229 on 30 September 1997. Additionally, the school has the services of a concessionary teacher due to the schools disadvantaged status, two remedial teachers, two special additional assistants and a shared home school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The enrolment on 30 September 1998 (on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based) was 204. A minimum enrolment of 210 pupils was required in order to retain the post of the seventh mainstream teacher. This is in spite of the fact that the retention figure has been reduced for the coming year.</P>

      <P>Resource teacher posts are only allocated to schools to cater for special needs children who are attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis. Children attending special classes enjoy a reduced pupil teacher ratio which is designed to reflect the needs of the children involved. In the case in question, the special class caters for children with a mild general learning disability and operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 13:1. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, from September next 1999, the ratio in question will be reduced to 11:1. There are currently ten pupils in the special class in question.

      <P>I introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses in the academic year 1998-99. These grants are means tested and the rates of grant, income limits, and other criteria for eligibility are similar to those which apply to the third level student support schemes.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years, when reviewing the third level student support schemes, to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. Similarly, maintenance grants have been increased in recent years in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index. This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing certain courses of study. The question of increasing income limits and maintenance grants for the 1999-2000 academic year is being considered in the context of the annual review of the schemes. I expect to be in a position to announce details of the student support schemes for 1999-2000 shortly.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. The Deputy will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing demands in the education sector.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the payment of grants under the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses are a matter for the vocational education committees, which are entrusted with the administration of the scheme. I am confident that the VEC's will make every effort to process applications and make payments to students without undue delay.</P>

Late last year I asked the expert advisory group on examinations, a group which I established to provide independent advice on the operation of examinations, to provide me with a discussion paper for publication and as a basis for a thorough review of our approach in this area. I received the group's report last month.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for the publication and circulation of the discussion paper and recently in the national press the expert advisory group invited submissions from interested parties and individuals in relation to the issues identified in the discussion paper and on the operation of special arrangements generally. The discussion paper brings out very strongly the complexity of this issue. In particular, it highlights the tension within our examination system between the need for equal treatment and fairness on the one hand and on the other hand the desire to take account of human circumstances. The discussion paper also deals expressly with issues which arise in the case of students with specific learning difficulties, including the issue of extra time.</P>
      <P>Previous reviews of the special arrangements schemes were conducted internally in my Department. I was particularly anxious that this review would be public and open in order to build a consensus on how best to respond to the needs of the individual student within the constraints imposed by both the format of some examinations and the need to maintain full confidence and credibility in our systems of national certification. I was also concerned that international practice would be considered in the review and the discussion paper deals with the UK position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My aim is to have a further report in the autumn from the expert advisory group, after they have considered any submissions received, so that <Col N="712" /> any changes can be in place for the examinations in 2000. I anticipate that the issue of additional time will arise in submissions and be fully considered in the process.</P>

      <P>The way in which resources are provided to second-level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges and voluntary secondary schools. Consequently, direct comparison between the two sectors is difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant to cover VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a per capita basis based upon enrolments.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding which has available to it the report of a technical working group. Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools. The group's recommendations when available will inform future developments in the funding of schools.</P>

      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has improved due to the allocation of additional ex-quota and concessionary posts and the application of a reduced ratio in respect of a range of new programmes which have been introduced in second level schools. The Deputy will also be aware of my recent significant initiative which introduced a retention ratio of 18:1 in relation to schools with over quota full-time teachers who <Col N="713" /> might otherwise be redeployed. This coupled with the provision of a remedial entitlement to all second level schools and the extension of the home school liaison scheme will have a considerable and sustained impact on the pupil-teacher ratio at second level.</P>
      <P>These moves clearly indicate the importance this Government attributes to education, and demonstrate its commitment to seriously addressing the issue of teaching resources available in our schools.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government has appointed a Commission on Childhood Abuse which is to be chaired by Ms Justice Laffoy of the High Court. The commission will provide a forum for victims of abuse and will in addition conduct wide-ranging inquiries into the nature, extent and causes of abuse of children in Irish society. The commission will be an independent body, free to conduct inquiries when and where it sees fit. The Government has undertaken to provide the commission with any statutory powers and protections it requires. While I would not, therefore, presume to pre-empt the decision of the commission as to how it will conduct its work, inquiries of the kind referred to in the Deputy's question would be more effectively conducted by the commission, if it considers that to be relevant, in the context of its extensive inquiries into all aspects of abuse of children. It is not my intention therefore to make separate inquiries into the matter.</P>

      <P>The position is that, currently, there are no arrangements in place to cater for the transfer of pensionable service to or from public bodies in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The public service transfer scheme, which is administered by the Department of Finance, provides for the transfer of service, on a reciprocal basis, between participating organisations. Any organisation in the public or private sector, including organisations outside the State, is free to participate in the scheme provided it is prepared to accept the obligations of membership including the liability to make contributions, where necessary, towards the ultimate cost of serving benefits.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the European Commission is, to date, the only organisation outside the State with whom a transfer arrangement has been agreed. The question of the superannuation arrangements which will apply in the case of the cross border bodies is currently being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> With regard to service in Northern Ireland generally, the position is that the question of the transferability of superannuation rights is kept under review. The Minister for Finance has informed me that, although there are major differences between our transfer of service arrangements and those which apply in Northern Ireland, he will be happy to respond favourably to any workable proposals which emerge in this area. In the circumstances, my Department will, as a first step, be glad to explore this question further with the Ministry of Education in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employers' PRSI. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional <i>per capita </i>grants for primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, and has been in operation since 1 September 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil &ndash; £15 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied. Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no secretarial or caretaking provision already rather than increase the <i>per capita</i> grant rate of £30 per pupil. In this regard, the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing grant aid to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for these services. The position of schools that are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any <Col N="716" /> improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>The issues of double tripping and the safe operation of the service to Scoil Naomh Molaise, Grange have been examined by my Department. The transport service to this school is operated by a mini-bus, which has a double trip to the school.</P>
      <P>In the operation of the school transport system, buses are normally required to operate a number of runs. To facilitate the operation of these services, children are often required to wait some time, morning and evening, for their service.

      <P>Safety is of paramount importance to my Department, and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport on its behalf. Set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind.</P>

    <P>As the existing level of services is within my Department guidelines, I regret that it would not be open to my Department to alter the present arrangements.

      <P>The curriculum of the Steiner schools differs in a number of significant ways from that of the national schools. These include the Steiner approach to early childhood education, reading, mathematics and history. The Steiner method was the subject of a recent High Court ruling.</P>

      <Col N="718" /> The Deputy will appreciate that the existence of solid national standards for qualifications and the curriculum represents an essential element to protecting and promoting the quality of our education system.</P>

      <P>An official of my Department recently met two people who are not recognised by my Department as qualified primary teachers. The two people sought recognition as trained primary teachers as a consequence of service that they have given over a number of years. The bulk of the service given by the two people has been substitute service.</P>
      <P>The presentation made by the two people is being considered within my Department. As soon as a decision is reached in this matter, the persons in question will be informed.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of parents in relation to the weight of schoolbags; his views on whether there is a risk to children's health as a result of this weight; the measures, if any, his Department is taking to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by parents and other groups about the weight of schoolbags and I share those concerns. With this in mind, I set up a working group in Autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags and the working group reported to me last year.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group outlines a number of recommendations which have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations relates to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, has initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters have also been distributed to all schools which highlight the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outline a range of local measures that can be adopted in order to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for each school to choose those measures which would be most suitable to its needs.</P>
