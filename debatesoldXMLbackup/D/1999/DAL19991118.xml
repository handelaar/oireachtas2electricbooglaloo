    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods): The Order of Business today shall be as follows: item 2, Comhairle Bill, 1999, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and item 3, Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the business proposed for today, does the Minister see any irony in the fact that one of the two items being considered today is a Bill to reduce and control immigration on the very day that the Institution of Engineers says its lack of qualified engineers will prevent the Government's national plan from being implemented and that a lack of qualified nurses and other specialists will prevent the Government's national breast screening programme from being implemented? Does the Minister see any irony in this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular legislation today on the national plan. So far as the national plan is concerned, it is unprecedented. When the engineers and others have had an opportunity to look into it properly they will find there is much in it for them, and especially for engineers here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there are four sitting days after today's business concludes before the budget and only six sitting days after the budget, before the session closes, and I understand the Government Whip will be meeting with other Whips later today, will the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, who is clearly at sea this morning&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Whips. A debate on the national plan will be held as soon as it is possible to make arrangements for it. Obviously it will be an opportunity for a major debate and it will be included in the debate on the budget. We are in the happy position where the Estimates are published well in advance of the budget and the national plan for the next six to seven years is published in advance of the budget. That is something the Leader of the Labour Party has sought for years and we have achieved that. Any further discussions can be arranged between the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw to the attention of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources that the national plan is not the private property of one particular party, nor has it been agreed by the people who have to sign it, that is, Brussels. Before it is sent to the Commission this House should have an opportunity to debate it and to draw to the attention of the citizens of the State who will have to fund 90% of its provisions, its many defects. Is the Minister in a position today or will the Minister of State, the Government Chief Whip, be in a position to indicate to the various parties when we will have a debate on the national plan? It is not, I respectfully suggest, adequate to say it can be rolled in with the budget. That is an evasion of parliamentary responsibility. This plan, which the Minister has said is for the next seven years, will be debated only once.</P>

      <P>Yet again there are newspapers reports today about the future of the Air Corps. Serious concerns have been voiced by Air Corps staff because of the lack of planning and investment in the service. Similar concerns have also been expressed with regard to the Naval Service. Will the Minister confirm if the White Paper will definitely be published this year? It would appear that the fate of these services rests on the White Paper since no decisions have been made. We praise these services when they do their work effectively, as they did this week and when there was a tragic accident earlier this year, but we refuse to invest in either service.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to present this Bill to the House. The Bill provides for the establishment of a new organisation, Comhairle, to combine the National Social Service Board, the NSSB, with certain disability support functions of the National Rehabilitation Board, the NRB. The proposal is one of a series of measures being undertaken by the Government to mainstream the provision of services for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges associated with citizenship and that all obstacles to the enjoyment of these privileges should be removed. These obstacles have been identified by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That report adopted three guiding principles: equality, maximising participation and enabling independence of choice.</P>

    <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises disability as one of the most important social challenges facing us today. It includes, as stated priorities, implementation of the commission's report and achieving greater equality for people with disabilities. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has specific responsibility for disability issues and is coordinating the Government's programme in implementing the commission's report across a range of Departments. Since taking up office, the Government has taken a number of significant steps in promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities. The establishment of the National Disability Authority on a statutory basis through the National Disability Authority Act <Col N="272" /> and the setting up of an interim board represent a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>The Bill to establish Comhairle is a further significant measure in this mainstreaming process. Comhairle will be the mainstream support agency for information services for all people, including those with disabilities. It is just a part of an overall Government programme aimed at ensuring that people with disabilities are treated equally by all service providers. The primary responsibility for this rests with the service providers themselves. The NDA will have a key role in developing standards, monitoring progress and promoting awareness at all levels. Comhairle's complementary role will relate specifically to information services as it seeks to ensure that all individuals, including those with disabilities, have access to information, advice and advocacy of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>I will review some of the more important initiatives relating to people with disabilities. On the legislation front, important advances have been made on two fronts. Last June the Employment Equality Act, 1998, was enacted. This legislation outlaws discrimination on grounds of disability in gaining access to employment and advancing in employment. It gives protection to employees in both the public and private sectors as well as to applicants for employment and training. Also, the Equal Status Bill, which has now passed Committee Stage in the House, prohibits discrimination on a number of grounds, including disability, and deals with discrimination outside the employment area, including education, provision of goods and services, accommodation and disposal of property.</P>
    <P>In addition the Government has provided substantial funding during the past two years &ndash; more than £91 million &ndash; in developing services for those suffering from a mental or physical disability. In the review of our programme for Government, we recognise that these services must now be developed at a faster rate and we have given a firm commitment to provide substantial additional funding to address this shortfall in services. Key priorities will include the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and a comprehensive disability strategy.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Comhairle under the Bill follows from recommendations made by an establishment group set up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 1997. The establishment group was asked by Government to develop detailed proposals for a new infrastructure for disability issues and to consider the most appropriate future location of departmental responsibility for the functions of the NRB. The group reported to Government in June last year. The Government adopted its report, Building a Future Together, and gave approval for the implementation of each of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities wish to be treated the same as their fellow citizens by having services <Col N="273" /> delivered to them by the mainstream agencies, that is, the agency that provides the service to the rest of the community. This represents a significant change of approach. In the past, the State addressed disability issues primarily from a medical perspective. Responsibility for services to people with disabilities was, therefore, placed with the Department of Health and Children, with many of the services provided by that Department through the NRB. The new mainstreaming approach now proposed is not intended to replace such measures but to operate in parallel with them. In line with this principle, the group also recommended a number of administrative measures which involve the relocation of the functions at present performed by the NRB.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements in the proposed arrangements recommended by the establishment group was the setting up of the National Disability Authority. The authority will be the central focus of the Government's approach to the provision of services to people with disabilities. The main function of the authority will be to develop standards in services provided to people with disabilities and to conduct independent monitoring of these services. It will not be a service-providing agency but will work in close co-operation with service providers in the voluntary and statutory sectors. An interim board has been established and it is planned to have the new authority up and running within the next few months.</P>
    <P>In line with this mainstreaming approach, the Government has decided that vocational training and employment services for people with disabilities will be provided by FÁS operating under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This will represent a major step in integrating people with disabilities into the workforce and enabling them to achieve independence and choice. Similarly, the information services for those with disabilities provided by the NRB, under the provisions of the Bill, will be provided through Comhairle. A number of other services will be attached to other Departments, such as the audiology service, which will be provided by the Department of Health and Children through the health boards.</P>
    <P>The establishment group is continuing its work towards implementing the new administrative and institutional arrangements for the NDA and the mainstreaming of services. It is working closely with both management and staff of the NRB and the relevant Departments and agencies. A target date of the end of March 2000 is now envisaged for the full implementation of these series of measures which also involve a transfer of NRB resources to the various Departments and agencies, including Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is the setting up of the new organisation, Comhairle, to ensure individuals have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information, advice and advocacy services on the full range of social services. The provision of information is an essential element <Col N="274" /> of the relationship between social service providers and the people who use their services. In the past this aspect of the service may not have been given the attention it deserved. However, I am pleased to say that administrators are now much more aware of the needs of their customers.</P>
    <P>The development and delivery of social services is a complex task at the best of times. Schemes and supports are designed to meet the needs of people, individuals and families in a wide variety of circumstances and it is, therefore, necessary to ensure that supports are broadly based and flexible enough to address their needs. The downside to this is that they can often be difficult to understand and, perhaps, even more difficult to access, particularly where the benefits required are administered by more than one Department or agency. In these circumstances, the challenge is to ensure that people have access to information and advice at local level which is clear, accurate and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on Departments to directly provide information and advice on their own services and there is an expectation that this would be broad enough to guide people towards related services provided by other agencies. I am sure Deputies will agree that we have seen significant improvements in this regard in recent times. However, the ownership of information is not vested in the statutory services alone, nor should it ever be. Independent sources of information can invariably offer a far more flexible and comprehensive service than any single arm of Government. It is extremely important that people have a choice in this and it is clear that, in many cases, they prefer to deal with an independent organisation either as an alternative to the statutory services or in preparation for claiming their rights and entitlements.</P>
    <P>For many years, the NSSB has provided resources to the independent information and advice-giving sector as well as to the statutory sector. The NSSB transferred from the Department of Health and Children to my Department a few years ago. This was seen as a first step towards strengthening and developing the independent information sector. Since then, the NSSB has embarked on a strategy of significantly upgrading the support it provides for both independent and statutory information providers centres. For example, it registers and supports a network of 85 independent citizens' information centres throughout the country which provide a free, confidential and impartial information service to members of the public. This involves some 35 full-time centres which are supplemented by some 50 part-time and mobile centres.</P>
    <P>The NSSB has also developed a computerised database, the citizens' information database, which is a comprehensive, user-friendly source of information on social services. It has become one of the mainstays of many information-giving organisations throughout the country. In addition, the board has over the years provided a wide range of services to the voluntary social ser<Col N="275" /> vice sector. Its strategy in this area includes the development of a range of services to support this sector in the areas of information, training management and organisational supports.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board operates 18 centres which provide, as part of their remit, information, advice and advocacy services to people with disabilities. These centres are located in the larger towns throughout the country and distribute a range of information on services in a variety of formats to people with disabilities. Some of the larger centres have a display range of technical aids for those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the main features of the Bill. The Bill is divided into three Parts. Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 5, contains standard and technical provisions. Part 2 provides generally for the functions of the new organisation, and requirements relating to the members of the board, its chief executive and staff. Part 3 includes provisions arising from the dissolution of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the functions of Comhairle. The principal function will be to ensure individuals have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information, advice and advocacy on the full range of social services and are referred to such services. To date, this function has been discharged by the NSSB and the NRB in a variety of ways. The first priority for Comhairle will be to ensure that there will not be any disruption of services.</P>
    <P>An important responsibility of Comhairle will be to assist and support people, including those with disabilities, to understand their needs of the broad range of social services and to help them identify the most suitable options available to them. It will assist them in securing their entitlement to services by referring them to the appropriate agency or service provider. In this context, Comhairle will have responsibility for continuing the provision of information and advice on assistive technology for people with disabilities. This latter service is currently provided by the NRB through some of its main centres. This involves information and advice on technical aids and options for people with disabilities and providing up to date information on new technological developments.</P>
    <P>Comhairle will also continue to perform a number of functions which are currently discharged by the NSSB. These include promoting access to information by working with other organisations in the voluntary and statutory sectors; contributing to the development of social policy through feedback from the users and providers of information and supporting voluntary organisations which deliver social services by providing a range of services on information, training and organisational development support.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires Comhairle to prepare and submit to the Minister strategic plans relating to its objectives and strategies. The full integration <Col N="276" /> of the various functions and operations of the two components of the new organisation will be Comhairle's initial goal.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the membership of the board which will comprise 20 members including a chairperson. The board will include five members representative of people with disabilities nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, an elected member of staff and a representative from my own Department. Last November, I appointed a new board to the NSSB. In anticipation of the establishment of the new organisation, I extended the membership of that board from 15 to 20 and included some five members representative of people with disabilities who were nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This board is acting as the interim board of Comhairle and is currently working closely with the establishment group and my Department on the practical arrangements involved in the proposed merger of both agencies. On the establishment day, the board will become the first board of Comhairle. The section also deals with the terms of office of the members of the board who shall be appointed for a maximum period of three years.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the appointment of a chief executive of Comhairle who shall be appointed by the board. The main functions of the chief executive will be to administer the affairs of Comhairle. Section 14 provides for the appointment of staff of Comhairle.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 23 are standard provisions concerning grants and the accounts and audit of the new organisation. Comhairle will be funded primarily by the Exchequer through an annual grant from my Department's Vote. The necessary resources will be drawn from those currently available to the NSSB and a transfer of funds from the Vote of the Department of Health and Children to my Department in relation to the current NRB services. The issue of additional resources will be examined in the context of the board's three year strategic plan to be prepared immediately following its establishment.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the submission by the board of an annual report to the Minister and for the laying of each such report before each House of the Oireachtas. Sections 27 to 32 deal with the dissolution of the National Social Service Board and the transfer of the staff, assets and liabilities of the board to Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to achieving greater equality for people with disabilities. Under its new mainstreaming approach to service provision, the Government aims to ensure that people with disabilities are treated equally, have access to all services, including employment and training, and to comprehensive and clear information on their entitlements on the same basis as provided to the rest of society.</P>
    <P>I express my gratitude to the NSSB for the work it has carried out since 1984 in developing an independent information sector and to the NRB for its work over the last 30 years in provid<Col N="277" /> ing a dedicated service to people with disabilities. I am confident that the staff of both organisations, who will transfer to Comhairle, will continue to provide excellent standards of service for all people, including those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Comhairle Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Comhairle Bill seeks to establish a new statutory authority through the merger of the National Social Service Board and the transfer of certain functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. I pay tribute to the staff of both the NSSB and the NRB for the excellent and valuable work they have done to date in their current organisations and to wish them continued success in their new role.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum to this Bill describes it as &ldquo;a key element in the new arrangements being put in place for disability services . in the interests of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities.&rdquo;. I want to focus on the role of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, from which Comhairle's establishment arises, is designed to &ldquo;empower and enable people with disabilities to achieve and exercise their economic, social, political and civil rights.&rdquo;. All of the official documents and reports on the delivery of policy and services for people with disabilities have common aspirations. These are quality, accountability, effectiveness, value and partnership. The challenge for all voluntary and statutory, particularly Comhairle, is to translate these aspirations for better services for people with disabilities into a reality.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities concluded that:</P>
      <P>Public attitudes towards disability are still based on charity rather than on rights. The odds are stacked against people with disabilities and almost every turn. Whether their status is looked at in terms of economics, information, education, mobility or housing, they are treated as second class citizens. They want and are entitled to equality and full participation as citizens.</P>
      <P>I concur with those sentiments.</P>
      <P>It is said that knowledge is power. For people with disabilities, access to information is an essential prerequisite to their equality and full participation as citizens. It is important then that the primary function of Comhairle, that of an information provider, is specially targeted and focused at providing clear, accurate and comprehensive advice to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Accessibility is a very important issue. Given that the new body will use the NSSB's citizens' information centres and NRB premises throughout the country, one hopes the premises are accessible to mobility impaired people. That does not always apply to Departments. If the above premises are not accessible to people with disabilities, the matter should be rectified without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> The form in which information is made available is also important. It should not be assumed that all of the people who wish to access information are literate. A man who had been hired as a temporary dust man visited my clinic last Monday. He worked away for about three months and was on six months trial, but then he got a kidney complaint towards the end of one week. He could not go to work on the Thursday or Friday and went back on the Monday with a medical certificate but the supervisor fired him. He asked why he was being fired as he had a reasonable excuse. The supervisor said that he did not notify him, that all his arrangements were upset and that he was being fired because he did not telephone him. I said to the chap, my constituent, that was not unreasonable and that he should have telephoned. He said he would tell me what he could not tell the supervisor &ndash; he could not read. That is the type of situation we tend to forget can arise. When talking about accessibility to information, we cannot assume that all those who wish to access information are literate. Recent studies have shown that a sizeable proportion of the population is functionally illiterate.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are able to access the information they require in whatever form is most appropriate to their needs. Having said that, written information must be user friendly and clear. The NESF report No. 6 on the quality delivery of social services found that the amount of information on social services available in a user friendly form is frequently inadequate, confusing or non-existent. Sometimes excessively complicated language is used in information booklets provided by statutory authorities. It is essential that information available to people with disabilities, their families and carers is clear and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>In our offices in the Oireachtas, we have computers and those of us who can use them, sometimes with the assistance of our secretaries, can access replies to parliamentary questions quickly through the Lotus Notes programme. When one prints a copy of a reply to a question from an important Department such as the Department of Health and Children, one is given the number of the question and the name of the Minister answering it but not the question. That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I found an example on my desk yesterday which I thought I would mention. Parliamentary Question 247 of 16 November answered by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, leads off with the words &ldquo;I have no plans to introduce legislation along the lines suggested by the Deputy&rdquo; and continues with the remainder of the response. It does not, however, give the question or the name of the Deputy who tabled it. One can see how ridiculous it is that one gets a reply which reads: &ldquo;I have no plans to introduce legislation along the lines suggested by the Deputy&rdquo;, but one does not know what legislation was suggested or who the Deputy is. That type of ridiculous format is <Col N="279" /> something against which we should guard. I have no doubt Comhairle will be a little more efficient and user friendly in the information it provides than the Department of Health and Children in this particular instance.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect which must be raised. The new information service provision for people with disabilities needs to be targeted, in other words, Comhairle's role should be pro-active, targeting people who might benefit from services and advice. The Minister may have thought he was escaping scot-free on this front, but I would like to refer to another parliamentary question at which I looked on Tuesday. I tabled the question to the Minister's Department on the entitlement of those aged 75 years or over to free electricity and other free schemes and whether these people had been notified of their entitlement.  Since 1997 people over 75 years, who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare type payment, can receive these allowances, regardless of their household composition or medical circumstances, so it is an improvement for those in that category. The only trouble is that they must know about it. Unless somebody over the age of 75 knows of this improvement, they cannot claim it. When I checked what efforts were made to notify those over 75 years, I was told various booklets are available, that there was publicity after the budget, that there is a free telephone service and so on. That does not target that particular group which does not always listen to the radio after the budget or which is not able to access the mountain of information being pressed on the public by a Minister for Finance. Many of them do not read the booklets which are distributed. This is an example of where a benefit which is or should be available to people is not being availed of because there has not been a targeted and focused effort to make sure they are aware of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Having raised the issue, I was told by the Minister on Tuesday that the Department intends to issue a specific mailshot next year to all pensioners over 75 years, who are not in receipt of the free schemes, to notify them individually of their potential entitlements. I heartily approve of the decision to mailshot those over 75 years but why did it take a parliamentary question from me to encourage pro-active action by the Minister on this issue? More importantly, what about those who were over 75 years in 1997 and who may have passed away? What about those who will never be able to avail of this relaxation of the rules because they did not know about it? Why does it take three years to send a mailshot to what must be a limited number of people over the age of 75 years who are in receipt of social welfare and who might be able to avail of this relaxation of the rules? </P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will find it difficult to disagree that three years is a little long to be hoarding that information from the people who could avail of it. I am glad the situation is now <Col N="280" /> being resolved and a mailshot will be done but I raise it as an instance of the need for a pro-active approach from the point of view of targeting people who might benefit from services or advice. I hope the example I gave will, if nothing else, serve as an example of the way not to do it in the future. I have no doubt Comhairle will not wait three years to target people and tell them about their potential entitlements.</P>
    <P>A recurring theme of submissions to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was the difficulty experienced by people with disabilities and their families regarding their entitlements and services which might be relevant to them. The onus should be on the information providers to inform people with disabilities of everything to which they are entitled, in other words, they should provide blanket information and target specialist groups with particular needs, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Accessing information can be difficult at the best of times but at a time of crisis, it can be a nightmare. People who have a crisis in the family and who suddenly find themselves in the role of carer following an accident or sudden and debilitating illness may be unsure of the help and support to which they are entitled. It is essential that a one stop shop approach to information is taken. One telephone call or one visit, or two at most, should be sufficient to provide all the information needed.</P>
    <P>Section 7(c) states that the new board will promote greater accessibility, co-ordination and public awareness of social services and of information, advice and advocacy services provided in relation to such services, whether by a statutory or voluntary body. This raises the matter of accessibility. The new centres will not be physically close to all centres of population and will not serve all remote rural areas &ndash; I am raising a provincial point here. It is essential the new body works in close co-operation with voluntary bodies to ensure they have an active role in information provision. That could apply in cities also but it is perhaps a more important issue in country areas.</P>
    <P>Voluntary agencies providing services for people with disabilities come into daily or weekly contact with many people who require advice and assistance either for themselves or for family members. It is essential that Comhairle provides voluntary agencies with targeted, focussed information packs which will be tailored to meet the client base of each voluntary agency, whether they deal with people with physical, sensory or intellectual disabilities or people with dementia or mental illness.</P>
    <P>How will independent advice be provided? Citizen information centres depend on volunteers to a large degree. Are there plans to recruit and, more important, to train volunteers in order to make them aware of the complex needs of those with disabilities? A professional service with the expertise to fully answer the questions of people with disabilities and those who care for them is required. If this is not in place, people will be <Col N="281" /> shuttled from one place to another in an attempt to access full information. Thus, far from providing equality and mainstreaming, people with disabilities will be more dependent on others. Mainstreaming is only effective if it meets the needs of the most severely disabled person and this new service must meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that Comhairle will deliver advocacy services but will stop short of legal representation. We need clarification on this matter. What will happen if a person with a disability requires representation at an appeals tribunal in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? Comhairle is to be funded as a Government agency &ndash; can it then be truly independent? The Minister, as a legal colleague, will understand that there could be a danger of a conflict of interest here. This matter can be teased out further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I support its passage to Committee Stage. It is essential that in the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board and the creation of this new structure, people with disabilities will have a net gain in service provision and that the mainstreaming objectives are achieved. It is essential that those with disabilities do not have greater hardship in accessing services or information on services, rights and entitlements. The new service must have the full confidence and support of everyone involved in this sector, not least those with disabilities themselves. It would be unforgivable if we failed them in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has been in gestation for the past two and half years and which was approved by Cabinet early this year. This is a long promised approach and ultimately goes back to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. As the Minister said, it leads on from the strategy for equality and the report of the establishment group in June last year.</P>
      <P>My criticism of the Bill is in line with my past criticisms of the Government. For example, a fundamental gap in the Enterprise Ireland Bill was the failure of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to spell out a strategic vision of what Enterprise Ireland's functions would be or the task it would perform for the economy. The same fault applies to this Bill, the bulk of which is taken up with the structural establishment of an organisation. With the exception of section 7, a brief section on functions, we do not get a detailed view from the Minister or the Department on the broader role this Bill will have. The Minister will refer to the three year plans and the strategic plan and he has already given a general guide as to how he sees this body operating, but he could have included a sense of vision for the organisation in the Bill. We will return to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the National Social Service Board for its achievements in the past 30 years. Most Deputies eagerly await their copy of <i>Relate</i>, the <Col N="282" /> information digest produced by that board, as we are all in the business of distributing information. All of us have made use of <i>Relate</i> over the years and the current issue has a cogent article on the Planning and Development Bill in the Seanad. As usual, the article is simple, useful and very clear. I congratulate the approximately 30 members of staff of the NSSB on their achievements since the board was established as a non-statutory body in 1971. It became a statutory body in 1984, but there were some elements in the Dáil in the mid-1980s which were not fond of the idea of having an independent advice and information network and the agency had to fight hard for its existence. However, it has played a valuable role in our society for the past 30 years and I congratulate its staff, who will have moved to Comhairle by March.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the National Rehabilitation Board for its achievements over roughly the same period. It has a long history of disability support and now has approximately 10,000 registered clients. Up to 10% of our population suffers from a disability of one type or other and the 52 staff members who will transfer to the new agency have shown great diligence in providing job advice and information advocacy.</P>
    <P>Unlike the NSSB, the NRB has long had an extensive regional network of 18 offices, as the Minister said, and it has had deep involvement with its clients on a one to one level. This should have been included in the functional provisions of the Bill, as the key element of service to people with disabilities must be one to one, personalised mentoring. All our families have been touched by disability and we all have a direct interest in the issue. People suffering from a disability and those who work with them are concerned that the Minister has not spelled out the absolute necessity for a personalised service. About 60% of people with a disability are either unemployed or seriously underemployed. This highlights the nature of the task faced by the valiant workers of the NRB over the years. This House and the Minister for Education and Science have only begun to appreciate the failure to mainstream people with disabilities in education. There is often a huge gap in educational standards because of schools which were not amenable to pupils with a disability and a total lack of provision for people with serious disability. This gap needs to be closed. This aspect will be raised by the Labour Party on Committee Stage. I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill forward and on its essential concepts of independent advice, advocacy and mainstreaming the needs of those with disabilities. For too long our fellow citizens with disabilities have had to suffer grave and outrageous inequalities, which &ndash; to be fair to all parties in the House &ndash; recent Governments have tried to remedy. However, we still have a long distance to travel.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome if it means genuine upgrading and consolidation of services for people on low incomes and social welfare. Our <Col N="283" /> services provision for people on social welfare supports has been characterised by fragmentation. For example, a query on returning to work can take several telephone calls to various Government Departments and the health board &ndash; Deputies often have that frustrating experience in their offices. This laborious process can be extremely off-putting especially if someone is left waiting on the telephone for what seems like an age before their query is answered. Unless people with a disability have access to a telephone or an accessible building, their search for information can be an insurmountable struggle. Restriction to buildings and a lack of information in Braille form can be a frustration for disabled people.</P>
    <P>Advice from a one-stop shop is the preferred option for people accessing information on their entitlements and options. This move to consolidate information provision is, therefore, very welcome. However, one of the key weaknesses of the Bill is the absence of a strategy for the development of the new agency. What is the Minister's commitment to training the agency staff of almost 100? The integrated staff may have different responsibilities than previously. Staff from the NRB will be redeployed to FÁS and the health boards so new staff in Comhairle may not be as familiar with giving a personalised service, providing information and trying to get someone a job. We also need to know how the agency will be developed in its initial years.</P>
    <P>One of the most fundamental tools in going from welfare to work is information provision. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is still the major information provider to those seeking income support and also has the dual function of policing payments. Last year we had a long discussion on section 26 of the Social Welfare Bill regarding the Minister's famous road blocks, about which Deputy Higgins, in particular, was very upset. However, the Minister seems to have abandoned this approach. As a former member of the Public Accounts Committee, I know long periods have been spent investigating welfare claims. This aspect lies uneasily with the concept of information provision. My experience and that of my constituents has been that in the past five to ten years, accessibility to the Department and the friendliness of the service oriented staff has improved. However, the function of information provision and benefit policing do not sit comfortably together.</P>
    <P>Independent welfare rights provision is crucial in assisting people to enter the formal economy. Many studies have shown that people working in the black economy who wish to move into the formal economy are far less likely to approach the Department for advice, for obvious reasons. They continue to work in the informal economy and approach independent voluntary advice providers or their political representatives. On two occasions in the past six months, the Government put the future of community employment and the <Col N="284" /> jobs initiative in doubt. Thankfully, under massive pressure from the Labour Party, especially my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, lobby groups and the Opposition, the short-term future of these schemes seems to have been secured. However, if the Government considers cutbacks to these schemes, what is its commitment to independent advice centres, CICs and unemployment centres?</P>
    <P>The Minister has made two visits to my constituency recently, one of which was to open a citizens' information centre in Coolock. Unfortunately, his visits clashed with other business in which I was engaged. We are also building new civic offices in Coolock for Dublin north-central. Has the Minister spelled out the relationship the Coolock CIC will have with Comhairle? Will there be a Comhairle office for Dublin north central? The Minister is shaking his head. If he wishes to carry on some of the traditions of the NRB, how will he equate this with the line management of this programme? Has the Minister thought this through? This is why we need a more comprehensive discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the unemployment centres. I am proud to be a director of the northside centre. For nearly a decade and a half, we have had a tradition of giving good social welfare advice. Many local volunteers have become skilled in providing this information and are deeply appreciated by the people of Coolock and the northside. A centre has been provided in Beaumont Hospital for visitors and patients. I know this is referred to in section 7. A few months ago I asked the Minister on Question Time if there was some way to more directly integrate these skilled volunteers &ndash; working for the St. Vincent de Paul, trade union centres and many other organisations &ndash; into the planned Comhairle network. Will the Minister give us a commitment on the long-term staffing of the voluntary centres?</P>
    <P>One of the problems CICs and other information providers experience is that when their staff are trained up, the CE scheme they are on ends and the cycle of training new people begins again. It is not ideal and I want to know how the Minister proposes to address it. I will refer later to the national plan and the money which the Minister sought for this area. However, the social economy and voluntary activities under the aegis of his Department need significant resources.</P>
    <P>One of the major concerns of organisations representing people with disabilities is access to citizens' information centres and community information centres. Many of them are housed in old buildings which do not offer disability access. With only a few months to go, no plans are in place to bring CICs up to a standard which would cater for the needs of all persons with a disability. I ask the Minister to address this matter in his reply. When does he intend that work will commence on upgrading such centres?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the level of investment he intends to make available through the new organisation not only from the point of view of the adjustment work required in CIC buildings, <Col N="285" /> but also the conversion of information into a format that is accessible to people with hearing and sight deficiencies? Organisations representing consumers of the NSSB and NRB have been awaiting the introduction of the Bill for some time. I have heard complaints in recent months that clients of both organisations, but particularly the NRB, feel there was not enough consultation with them before the Minister embarked on this plan and introduced the legislation. I ask the Minister to assure the House that he will offer a further consultation phase to the NSSB and NRB and their clients, particularly people with a disability, in the run up to Committee Stage. We look forward to the Committee Stage debate taking place at an early date.</P>
    <P>A disappointing feature of the Bill is that the Minister has failed to outline a clear vision for the future of Comhairle. Section 7 outlines a number of functions but there is a long history of citizens being denied basic rights through lack of information, advice and advocacy. Deputies probably meet up to 5,000 people on a one to one basis during our constituency work each year, but tens of thousands of other people never contact us or a citizen information centre, a law centre or an unemployment action centre. I do not intend to repeat the subject matter of recent parliamentary questions to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs but there has been the scandal of arrears in payments to widows, widowers and pensioners and the lack of take up of FIS. In addition, many people are unaware of their fuel allowance entitlements.</P>
    <P>A number of constituents have asked me whether the Minister would consider, in conjunction with Comhairle, providing a simple booklet to clients of his Department. The Minister sent Members a small synopsis and there is the general booklet which is available in the Department. However, with the exception of information which all Members will circulate about the budget, people often do not receive details of entitlements. Perhaps the Minister should consider providing some written information to clients of his Department.</P>
    <P>This should also apply in the areas of education, training and housing. Members provide information on housing on a weekly basis, but many citizens have gaps in their knowledge in terms of what is available, for example, with regard to the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. There are many areas where there is a huge lack of information, such as the recent case involving the right of a young person in the Youthreach scheme to do the junior certificate as an external student. People have a dearth of knowledge with regard to such situations and I hope the new organisation will address them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity in the Bill to lay out a vision of an informed alert society that is well aware of its fundamental rights to which citizens have full access. The Bill also provides an opportunity to renew the commitment to providing a society with equality for all citizens. I <Col N="286" /> referred yesterday during Question Time to the review of the Action Programme for the Millennium. I usually carry a copy of that modest and slim document, which is difficult to read because the type is so small and fading. I hope to utilise this document in the days leading up&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. The Minister's few flimsy comments in the document do not go anywhere near the commitment the Government should have to this area. The new NDA, Comhairle and the Disability Bill are mentioned, but there is no specific details about dealing with the dimensions of the problem I outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>The key question is how will Comhairle provide a personalised service for the 10,000 people who are currently clients of the NRB and the vast bulk of whom have not been consulted about the Bill? Up to 60% of them are unemployed or under-employed and there is an education deficit which Comhairle and its staff in the general advice centres will have to work hard to address. The organisation is facing a huge task. The details were discussed during the Fine Gael Private Members' motion this week about carers and disability, but the stark figures regarding the inequality in the State for which the Minister will now be responsible through Comhairle show that the task will be difficult. The Minister should reconsider how he can expand the idea of a personalised service with regard to section 7. Will he indicate on Committee Stage where the new offices will be located? I understand 11 premises will become the property of Comhairle. Will he examine the issues of staffing, training and development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have a copy of the national plan, which I also intend to use in the run up to the next general election. It contains a few brief comments on employment support services, but it appears that from a total of £40 billion only up to £260 million will be provided for services for people with disabilities. Given that this matter should be at the top of the agenda over the next six years, have the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for <Col N="287" /> Finance, Deputy McCreevy, provided sufficient funds for it?</P>
    <P>I referred previously to section 7. Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the key aspects of it, including independence and advocacy, and queried a number of points. The addition of a commitment to a personalised service on a one to one basis is important and should be considered. I have been closely involved with the establishment of the local employment service and many of us in the voluntary sector are most upset at the attempts by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to devastate the service and remove it from the partnership area. I will raise this matter with the Taoiseach because it appears the entire partnership approach is being abandoned by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned that I would like a commitment to expand the general information base to each client of the Department, the NSSB and NRB. I would also like a commitment in section 7 towards linkage with the CICs, law centres, unemployment centres and the skilled voluntary sector. Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about the necessity for a real information network, particularly in isolated rural areas for people with disabilities. How does the Minister envisage the centre in my constituency expanding? Does he envisage a nationwide network, more staff or front line interaction? There is a need to spell out the role of the advocacy service.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 9, why does the Government insist on attacking the notion of worker representation. There have been several examples of the Government establishing new organisations and attempting to either remove worker representation or diminish it to one worker representative on a board of 20 members. I do not understand this concept, given the role of worker directors in NRB from the outset. Do both partners in Government dislike the concept of worker representation? In semi-State bodies recently the Labour Party introduced direct worker participation through share ownership in new companies. We developed the idea in this country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;why is it saying to the 100 workers in the new organisation, a statutory body, that they will have just a 5% representation on the board? The Labour Party will seek to amend this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a weak commitment in section 12 to gender equality on the board. Again, this is central to the Labour Party's philosophy. I am pleased the former Minister for Education, <Col N="288" /> Niamh Bhreathnach, pursued this issue with great diligence in the previous Dáil. There is a watering down of that commitment and I would like the Minister to take his courage in his hands and commit himself to at least a 40% or a 60% representation for the two genders. I welcome the proposal in section 8 for a strategic plan and look forward to the annual report.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill. It concerns the needs and rights of the most vulnerable in society. It has been awaited for a long time. The staff of both organisations have adapted remarkably well, given that this development came out of the blue from their perspective. Nonetheless, it is an important initiative. Between now and Committee Stage, I would like the Minister to revisit section 7, in particular, to see if he can spell out more clearly a vision of this service organisation and how it will operate throughout the country. It must focus on the needs of people with disabilities, given the current circumstances of their employment. There must be a one to one service.</P>
    <P>On the national plan, I would like the Minister and his colleagues to renew their commitment to the 3% rule. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill. I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill which signals a major change for citizens' information. Information is a valuable commodity. The question of what information is disseminated and how and to whom it is disseminated is very important, particularly when one considers the amount of information available. There is a huge amount of information on the Internet. All Departments publish information documents on a daily basis and it is important this is done in a focused manner.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Broughan on the vision in this document and the objectives set out therein. It may be just a question of semantics. The vision and objectives of the Bill are set out in section 7. I do not think it is the function of the Minister or his officials to set out the strategy. This is the reason Comhairle is being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There will be a board of 20 members in Comhairle. These are experienced and competent people. They have the educational achievements to enable them set out a strategic plan. They are better qualified in this regard than the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>There is a vision that individuals will have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information in relation to social services, and so on. There should be no question of first class and second class citizens. We are all citizens with equal status and equal order of merit. I do not accept the concept of second class citizen and I would like the use of this phrase to be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle will build substantially on both the resources and expertise of both the NSSB and the <Col N="289" /> NRB at local, regional and national level. The primary role of the NSSB is to ensure all citizens have easy access to the highest quality information and advice on social services. Since being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare in 1996, it has embarked on a strategy to significantly upgrade the support it provides for all information providers. As the Minister has already stated, it supports a network of 85 independent citizen information centres. I was pleased recently to attend the 25th anniversary of the Crumlin Citizens' Information Centre which operates from Sundrive Road. That developed from another citizens' information centre which operated from the Mount Argus Community Centre on Lower Kimmage Road. The NSSB was founded in 1984 and these bodies have been operating very effectively and efficiently since 1974. I am pleased they are being brought together under Comhairle. This is another stage in the development of the type of information citizens need and deserve.</P>
    <P>The NSSB must be congratulated on developing a computerised database known as the Citizens' Information Database. This is a comprehensive user-friendly source of information for information providers on the full range of social services. More than 50% of the network is being computerised, allowing for full access to the database. This work will be ongoing under the Comhairle structure. The NSSB has provided a wide range of services to the voluntary social services sector for many years. These include a valuable range of supports in the area of information, training, management and organisational support, including group pension and insurance schemes. Substantial progress has also been made by the National Social Services Board and the Northern Ireland Association of Citizens Advice Bureau in creating an all-Ireland information database. This work, which will be continued under Comhairle, is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Following research carried out during 1998, the development of a national telephone based citizens information service is now being actively explored. This has the potential to have a major impact on how citizens access information. The attention devoted to this matter is consistent with the strategy within the NSSB of promoting the use of new technology to improve information dissemination. A challenge for the new body in the future will be to ensure that new technological developments, which are now set to become available to most households with the arrival of digital networks, will be fully exploited in improving citizens information provision.</P>
    <P>The functions of the NRB which will be transferred to Comhairle include 18 disability resource centres, and all such centres carry a wide range of information on services and entitlements in a variety of formats and are located in areas to ensure that they are fully accessible by people with disabilities. Some of the larger centres even act, in the display of a wide range of technical <Col N="290" /> aids, to help further those with disabilities in the recognition of their needs and the provision for that. The new body, Comhairle, will take this responsibility for providing the technological assistance to people with disabilities. This service involves the assessment of technical aids, advising people of available options and providing up to date information on technological developments.</P>
    <P>The provision and ease of access to information at all levels and especially the provision of advocacy services is of paramount importance in ensuring the participation of all citizens in as full and constructive a manner as possible. Comhairle will work to promote and support the development of independent information advice and advocacy service throughout the country to ensure that all citizens have access to accurate, timely, comprehensive and, most importantly, clear information to enable them to avail of the full range of social services.</P>
    <P>All Deputies provide exactly this type of information on the telephone and in our clinics on a daily basis to people who are in many senses excluded from the State system. It is our responsibility, as legislators, to ensure the ease of negotiation of that system by all members of society. When individual rights and entitlements exist, it is our responsibility to ensure that this information is disseminated as widely, and in a manner which is as easily accessible, as possible. Our efforts in seeking a focused provision of social services for those who are most in need of them are useless unless we can ensure the uptake of these resources.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, this distance between the citizens and the State has had to be bridged by Deputies, who individually have expended huge efforts in aiding constituents in negotiating the system. While such a service should have been provided it has also led to a disproportionate amount of Deputies' time being taken up in a cliente±list direction. The uptake of this function by an effective, fair and trustworthy body such as is proposed in the Comhairle structure is to be greatly encourage. Its results should also be that the resources of the House can be more fruitfully employed in legislative work. It is opportune now to congratulate the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, and the staff of the Department for the prompt, efficient and effective way in which the Department services the inquiries of Deputies from all parties.</P>
    <P>The creation of the new agency, Comhairle, reflects the ongoing determination of the Government to improve the provision of services to those with physical, mental and intellectual disabilities. The record demonstrates clearly that the Government has introduced, and continues to be committed to introducing, an unprecedented range of measures to improve the quality of life and create greater equality and opportunities for full participation for a very vulnerable sector of society. This is one of a series of measures being <Col N="291" /> introduced by the Government to mainstream the provision of services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The central element in these new institutional arrangements which have been introduced by the Government has been the development of the National Disability Authority, which is an independent statutory authority which provides specialist advice and information to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on disability and policy. It acts to co-ordinate policy development within the Department to ensure that the end results are finely attuned to the needs and can firmly focus on the requirements of those with disabilities. The necessary legislation for that body was passed last June.</P>
    <P>This year a total of £13.4 million &ndash; next year this figure will rise significantly to £16.4 million &ndash; has been allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this sum, £6.4 million will lead to the elimination of underfunding of existing services. Some £6 million was allocated to development needs while £4 million of this sum will be devoted to capital developments.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever, this Government oversaw the commencement of the national capital programme for the intellectual disability services. The importance of having a programme available to these services has been demonstrated already in that, in addition to the capital allocated to support new developments, the Government has been in a position to approve a number of major initiatives designed to provide new or refurbished facilities for people with an intellectual disability, facilities which were previously accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate places.</P>
    <P>The Government has also announced funding for two pilot community action plans which will focus on transport. The aim is to improve the delivery of transport services to people with disabilities and to develop models of good practice in service delivery which can be replicated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Apart from the special buses purchased this year, from next year all buses bought by Dublin Bus will be special, low-floor, fully accessible buses so that those with a disability in the community can be assured of the access to buses which they deserve.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental task force is engaged in drafting a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;, which will inform Government policy on disabilities in the future. Under the review of the Programme for Government, Fianna Fáil is committed to providing substantial additional funding to address the shortfall in services for the mentally and physically handicapped. Fianna Fáil is committed to developing a comprehensive disabilities strategy underpinned by the establishment of the National Disability Authority, policies of supporting advocacy by and on behalf of people with disabilities, and the preparation of a <Col N="292" /> major disability Bill. The Comhairle Bill is just another element in the framework being put in place by the Government which will involve the disabled in a more inclusive society and which will see the fulfilment of our vision of a more equal Ireland for all of its citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill but I am afraid it is too little, too late. People with a disability are always the most vulnerable. At a time when the Celtic tiger economy is booming, it is shocking to witness extreme poverty among certain sections of the community. For some unknown reason, the plight of this section of the community has fallen on deaf ears in the Government.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine how a Minister or Government could stand over a situation whereby the most vulnerable section of the community, the poorer section, is on the bread line. It is impossible to comprehend that the winter fuel allowance, which has operated for years, is still a meagre £5 a week. That amount of money would not be sufficient to buy a bucket of coal. The Minister, in his wisdom, should ensure that the allowance is increased to at least £15 per week to bring it into line with current living standards. Heat is as important as food to unfortunate people who are struggling to have decent conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it is all encompassed in the Comhairle Bill.</P>
      <P>I note that the Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges associated with citizenship and believes that all obstacles to the enjoyment of these privileges should be removed. I hope the Minister will live up to his words in that regard because the balance should be tilted in favour of the underprivileged section of society. It is of the utmost importance that people with physical disabilities and their families can be accommodated under the Comhairle Bill. I hope the Minister's views on this matter will be broadened when the Bill is passed into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tilting the balance can rebalance the distribution of resources so that they support the entire community. If this does not happen, the current imbalance and growing gap between the opportunities generally available in a booming economy and those available to people with physical disabilities will continue to hold sway. It is payback time for the underprivileged section of our community and for people with physical disabilities and their families, whose long acknowledged <Col N="293" /> need for practical and accessible supports have deliberately not been addressed while the country worked its way back from the brink of disaster.</P>
    <P>Social investment in urgently needed. Where services exist, they are often paltry and piecemeal. An intolerable price is being paid by people with physical disabilities and their families. The Government has a choice: it can largely ignore the urgent need for social investment to cater for the needs of people with physical disabilities and allow them to be pushed further into the margins or it can make a serious investment in this area with long-term benefits for everyone. A social infrastructure must be put in place to support people with disabilities and their families.</P>
    <P>The disabled section of Irish society has been neglected. Recent incremental improvements to existing services are not enough. There must be serious and substantial investment into this area. Anything else will only compound past neglect, further marginalise people and render meaningless commitments given by the Government. To date, we have had to rely on community employment schemes and these are now being severely reduced. I see no logic in reducing these schemes. At a time of such economic success, why did the Government curtail these schemes which are of such importance in terms of providing employment to disabled people and those on the breadline?</P>
    <P>The Government has stated that it is committed to people with disabilities living in and being fully part of the community. If that is so, it must make significant investment on their behalf. If the Government responded fully in respect of the areas to which I have referred, it would provide a major boost for individuals, their families and the community. There is a clear opportunity for the Government to invest in a major area of need in the community.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are 3,500 disabled people throughout the country. These people need a residential respite service. The impact of their disabilities and the need to support their families and carers makes such out of home breaks essential. Apart from planned breaks, there are crises of one kind of another to which these people must respond.</P>
    <P>Last year, Government research showed that there are 1,248 people who do not leave their homes, for any reason, on a regular basis. In effect, they are totally isolated. Increased funding has resulted in 115 of these people gaining access to a service which means there are still 1,113 people who will not leave their homes. That is a damning indictment of the Government's approached to this underprivileged section of the community.</P>
    <P>Local resource centres are the starting point &ndash; they are not an end in themselves &ndash; at which development programmes can operate and community participation commence. People have a basic need for hands-on support to assist them with daily tasks, such as dressing, preparing meals and personal care so that they can be indepen<Col N="294" /> dent and active in the community. It is estimated that this year, 173 people required a comprehensive, full-time service and 1,100 required a less intensive service. That makes a total of 1,273 people who require personal assistance. Such a service could be provided at a cost of £8.1 million which is only a drop in the ocean compared to the money that will be allocated in the forthcoming budget. I ask the Minister to use his clout at the Cabinet table to ensure that he obtains sufficient funding to offset this imbalance and thereby cater for the needs of disabled people.</P>
    <P>A voluntary body in my constituency, the West Cork Wheelchair Support Group, was formed out of a dire need to help people who are seriously disabled and confined to wheelchairs. It must be remembered that it is no good fitting out buses in Dublin with special facilities for disabled people when their counterparts in rural areas do not have access to such facilities and they are obliged to remain in their homes day in and day out. This is a sad indictment of the Government. The West Cork Wheelchair Support Group is trying to provide services to people living on the Beara, Muintir Bhaire and Mizen Head peninsulas and it operates three buses it purchased from funds raised through charity walks, raffles, etc. However, when it made an application to the Minister's Department and to the Department of Health and Children for an allocation to fund the purchase of these buses, which are fully adapted to cater for wheelchair users, it was turned down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not wandering. It is appropriate for me to go into detail because this House is the only forum where I can raise this imbalance. It is the only place where I can get a reply. I hope the Minister will reply and will not treat these concerns in a cavalier fashion. I am speaking for those people deprived of life's necessities. What system is there to support these underprivileged people in rural areas? What system exists in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency of Cavan-Monaghan? There are people who cannot avail of the free travel scheme because, although they are entitled to it, they live 25 miles from the nearest bus. They do not get out of their houses from one end of the week to the other. The only connection they have with society is the postman bringing them a message from the local shop.</P>
      <P>Let no one fool himself into believing that this Government is looking after the underprivileged. Far from it. I appeal for the Minister to consider making a special scheme available that will dispense those free schemes in a fair and equal manner. A fair deal for every citizen is needed &ndash; there should be day resources centres, residential respite care, personal assistant services and costed disability payments. Fair deals not buckled wheels. That is what is needed from this Government and the Minister's Department. I call on him to listen to what we have to say. We are only explaining that it is necessary for the Department to ensure that these people get their rightful share of the cake, that these people are denied the facilities that people in the cities and towns have because they live in isolated areas. These are the forgotten people who cannot get to the nearest village or town because they live 20 miles from it and there is no bus service. Special weekly services should be set up to cater for these people.</P>
      <P>The Bill has not encompassed that situation. It is all talk and no action. That is what worries me. The Minister must act before it is too late and ensure that these people are catered for under this Bill and that each one of them gets their rightful share. It should not make any difference whether they live in Ballybane or Ballsbridge. In Ballsbridge there are special buses for the disabled but what system applies in rural areas? The Minister is failing in his duty unless he caters for those people as well.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill regularises matters. It has been recommended by various bodies interested in the area. It is right and proper that services and information for people with disabilities should be available along with general information. We have made progress and it follows that any information should be co-ordinated through this new body, Comhairle. We must recognise that NRB and the NSSB have done great work over the years. I compliment the staff of both bodies. They can feel that they have done their job well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All recent Governments have done a tremendous amount for people with disabilities. Every year when the Estimates are published I am impressed by the figures. That has been so over the lifetime of this Government, particularly the figures which were released last week. I hope the budget will go further in improving matters. While I was impressed previously by the Estimates, when I heard the figures released by the Eastern Health Board in January, it seemed to be such a poor shadow of the overall figure. It makes a lie of Deputy Sheehan's line that everything is given to Dublin and nothing to rural areas. The health board figures appear impressive but in March or April when the figures for the agencies administering services locally are published, they are a shadow of what was provided in the Estimate and usually equate to 20 residential places and a number of day care places. It is always disappointing. While the initial funding that Government provides is attractive, is good value for money achieved down the line? Are too many <Col N="297" /> agencies and groups setting up their own little empires and bureaucracies? Extra staff is needed if more services are to be provided but they often seek to provide a Rolls Royce service or the maximum service for the minimum number of clients. I hope there will be greater analysis and examination of how this money is spent. At the end of the day it is taxpayers money and we are not getting good value for money from the end product. The Minister stated training for disabled people will now be undertaken by FÁS. That is a logical and worthwhile move.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is one of the best Departments for disseminating information to us, as public representatives, and the wider community. The system it has adopted where we can contact people in the Department is the best available. Some Departments perform deplorably and one might as well have one's head in the sand when attempting to obtain information. However, the Minister's Department is top of the list and the officials and Ministers who put this system in place and maintained it over the years deserve credit.</P>
    <P>Since the advent of freedom of information some Departments have transferred staff who previously dealt with queries from public representatives to areas which deal with freedom of information applications. If that has happened in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs I have not noticed it because the level of service is still quite good. However, in some Departments staff have been moved from one section which provides information to another to the detriment of the service to the public.</P>
    <P>The Department and the agencies, such as the National Social Services Board, have done a great deal in terms of disseminating information. I compliment the Minister and the Department for the new booklet which was recently sent to all pensioners. A number of people have called to my clinics and quoted from it. They blind me with science and information. Usually, I must give them the bad news that have perhaps selectively read what seemed to be good news but there is no doubt that the recent publication has provided wonderful information. If the Department is to be judged on giving out information, it is top of the class.</P>
    <P>There are different ways of transmitting information through public representatives, community groups and welfare rights groups, nationally or locally, and the Department and its agencies have done well. However, there is no doubt that there is a need to do it through independent organisations because public representatives meet people all the time who try to get them to prime them on what they should say to departmental officials when they apply for social welfare benefits. The Department has addressed this issue in recent years. However, if an individual gives the incorrect information, departmental officials must act on it. It is right and proper that there should be an independent source of infor<Col N="298" /> mation whereby people can prepare themselves for the formal interview with welfare officers.</P>
    <P>The Department has introduced facilitators who provide information to the public on back to work schemes, etc., and that has been an improvement, although there is still great confusion because of the bureaucracy involved. Manpower was amalgamated with FÁS years ago but people who worked in Manpower still do not feel part of the new organisation. They are isolated and nobody seems to give a damn about them. However, the Department, employment exchanges and other bodies which have been established provide information on the various schemes. The dissemination of information needs to be reorganised and streamlined because many groups give out the same information and people make work for themselves as a result. There is too much competition and the information is not given out in the most structured way. However, the information seems to get out anyway.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan and others referred to poor and disadvantaged people but many of them are well versed on their entitlements. They often stagger me with their knowledge of the system, which is more thorough and detailed than mine on many issues. I recall a colleague on the city council visiting a welfare rights office which was not sponsored by the Minister. It was run as a CE scheme and while the councillor was waiting to meet an individual, who was out of the office at the time, he was blinded with information about what the office provided. When they finally asked who he was, he replied that he was councillor X and the staff were intrigued. They were only aware of counsellors and not councillors. They did not know what was a councillor's role but they were experts in giving out information and helping people to access the system.</P>
    <P>Great efforts are made to distribute information and they are successful, but we fail in some cases. What happens then? This issue has been discussed in the House on many occasions. For example, when an individual fails to apply for the widow's pension or the old age pension the Department's attitude is not sustainable, even though the rules have been relaxed in recent years. I am not sure whether the number of these cases involved can be quantified and it could involve more people than I am aware but if we fail to inform people, there is a certain responsibility on us. We cannot be fully blamed but it is not fair or reasonable to throw the book at people because they did not apply for their pensions, etc. There is an onus on us to ensure information is disseminated and we cannot walk away if we fail to do so.</P>
    <P>The National Social Services Board produces a monthly publication entitled <i>Relate</i>, which is helpful and useful. If the Chair allowed us to debate the issues raised by the board in recent publications, Second Stage would continue until next year, although it is not far away. <i>Relate</i> is informative and is written in layman's language as far as is possible. I note one of the functions of <Col N="299" /> the NSSB is to prepare a pre-budget submission. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would not want Deputies to use this as an opportunity to make their own pre-budget submission as it might prolong the debate. It is interesting to note that the NSSB makes an input based on the feedback it gets from people with whom it is dealing in providing information. There is no doubt that, through the money advice service and the development of social policy, there has been tremendous change for the better in that area in recent years. The Minister and the Department should be given credit for it.</P>
    <P>Having looked at its annual report one small criticism I have is that the address of the NSSB is Ballsbridge. Deputy Sheehan made some remark about Ballsbridge. The remit of this organisation is to give out information on social welfare and such matters and its address is Ballsbridge. What message does that send? I suggest to the Minister, in the event that a new address is required for Comhairle, that, perhaps, Ballymun, Main Street, might be a more appropriate location. I am not here as salesman for Ballymun Regeneration but Ballymun is being recreated. There are tax incentives for certain areas and we are trying to lure out passport offices, new health board authorities, Garda divisional headquarters, Government Departments and so on. Kieran Murray and his team in Ballymun Regeneration are there and have the assistance of professional valuers, estate agents and so on. I do not suppose Comhairle can avail of tax incentives or whatever but I suggest an address such as Ballymun might give a better image. It might be better also for staff rather than being delayed in traffic jams every morning getting to downtown Ballsbridge. If an address means anything, the address of the NSSB sends a wrong message.</P>
    <P>Marvellous work has been done in recent years. Information is being given out but it could be better disseminated if there was less competition and less bureaucracy between the manpower office, the Department and the partnership boards. There are many people now disseminating information. At all community group meetings one will find Department leaflets. They are available everywhere. This is not all about competing boards and competing bodies. I do not give a damn whether it comes under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or whatever other Department is involved but there is a type of bureaucratic argument going on. Different people are competing for their own territory and that is not necessarily correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred briefly to community employment schemes and was critical of the changes threatened by the Minister and the Government. He has a point. The NSSB, the partnership Government, ICTU and so on seem to be run in many respects by expert groups and partnership groups. Everybody is making an input, sometimes everybody except the public <Col N="300" /> representative. Some of the Government announcements, such as that on CE schemes, are screened and fed through a spin doctor. However, I think that particular scheme was not considered by working politicians. While there was merit in some of the changes proposed, others were crazy. I now wonder if these changes were made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and not by the Minister present. Some of the changes were justified and now the Minister has to backtrack which does not do her credibility any good. We cannot be led exclusively by these so-called experts groups and consultants. By all means get the experts to provide the facts as they see them, but they must be related to one's own commonsense and feedback from the ground. When changes are made they must be the correct changes targeted at the right people.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Broughan was that of worker directors. I recall he made a similar speech here at the time part of Telecom was sold by the Government of which the Deputy was a member. The view from official quarters, the Civil Service or wherever, is that the role of worker directors is being watered down. It is good that worker directors have a role on State boards and that should be encouraged and promoted at every level. I do not know whether there is any validity in the comments about this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to gender equality. I would like to think we have got beyond that problem. This Bill is about mainstreaming services for the disabled. My view is that gender equality has been achieved and was the cause of the last decade. It is not necessary to press the buttons of the 1980s. Some people need to update their speeches and get on with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Higgins this morning I was not aware of what the Bill was about so that my contribution will not be as detailed as I would have wished on this important subject. That is my fault. I do not have great Irish as I got only 40.5 per cent so many years ago. However, I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Comhairle Bill seeks to establish a new statutory authority from the merger of the National Social Services Board and the transfer of certain functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. I want to be associated with the previous remarks to thank the staff of both organisations for the excellent and valuable work they have done in these organisations and wish the new body equal success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the provision of information is important. The new body will use the citizens information centres of the NSSB and the NRB premises throughout the country. It is hoped that the premises will be accessible to mobility impaired persons. If this is not the case in any of the premises the matter should be rectified without delay. The long-promised new premises in Monaghan town is in the building process and will be welcomed by all concerned, the <Col N="301" /> official announcement for which was made three and half years ago. Problems in regard to planning and other technicalities took some time to be resolved. Issues such as this make one wonder how accurate is the recently announced seven year programme. However, that is an issue for another day.</P>
    <P>Written information must be user friendly and clear. To this end I welcome the recent documentation provided by the Minister to old age pensioners. However, I draw his attention to the fact that County Monaghan has been omitted.  I hope it is only a technical mistake and that the Minister has not forgotten about the existence of County Monaghan. There are excellent social welfare advice centres in the county and I hope the lack of information on that can be rectified.</P>
    <P>It is essential that information for people with disabilities, their families and carers is both clear and comprehensive. The new information service provisions for people with disability must be targeted. In this regard, the Comhairle role should be pro-active and should target those who might benefit from the service or advice available. I am glad to hear it acknowledged by the Government side of the House that many people do not have all the information available to them. That may not be the fault of the Minister or his Department, but we encounter such people in our clinics from time to time. Funding could have been made available to them. For example, it was a long time before people realised they could avail of the widower's pension.</P>
    <P>Accessing information can be difficult at the best of times and it can be a nightmare in times of crisis. Those enduring a serious illness or bereavement are sometimes unaware of the benefits that could have eased the pressure they were under. Those family members who, following an accident or sudden and debilitating illness, suddenly find themselves in the role of carer can be unsure of the help and support to which they are entitled. It is essential to take a one-stop-shop approach to the provision of information and one, or at most two telephone calls or visits should be all that is necessary. In his speech the Minister said that people with disabilities wish to be treated in the same way as their fellow citizens when the mainstream agencies deliver services to them. That is important. The transport issue needs to be addressed, especially in rural areas. Many people are unaware of their entitlements. People approach me from time to time requesting help with transport, whether it be to hospital or elsewhere. This is especially the case for those with disablements. They cannot drive and perhaps their families are unable to secure a car under the criteria that apply to the disabled because, for example, no limbs have been lost.</P>
    <P>Rural transport is a serious issue. My secretary has come across many cases in my office where people have had to beg the community welfare officer to make funds available to ensure that weekend hospital appointments in, say, Dublin are kept. We must ensure that the disabled are <Col N="302" /> fully aware of their rights and what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>There are too many agencies involved in this area, be it FÁS, social welfare or the area based partnership offices. Many want to help and give information, but, unfortunately, it can take a long time for a claimant to go from one to the other. Whatever about the difficulties encountered by people who are a little unable and who are in receipt of social welfare benefits, this presents a major problem for the disabled. I hope this legislation will rectify these problems to ensure that information is freely available to those who need it.</P>
    <P>The issue of the rights of the disabled was raised this week during Private Member's business. Support must be provided to those who wish to stay at home. In many instances such people need permanent assistance rather than what is available through a FÁS scheme. I have encountered one case involving a 16 year old youth who is unable to do anything for himself. He sits propped up in a chair. His family have endured a nightmare in recent years but is now receiving more help, often from voluntary organisations. It would be very costly to look after this young man in an institution. His parents do not want that to happen. They want access to information that will let them know their exact entitlements.</P>
    <P>The budget presents an opportunity to provide full carer's allowance to those suffering serious disablement, virtually regardless of income. While there are people on a list of the disabled who are not that bad and do not deserve to be there, there are ways and means to treat differently those who are permanently disabled, whether they be permanently confined to a chair or whatever. I take this opportunity to beg the Minister to ensure that such people have a right to assistance, including the full carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the likes of the Lions Club, community groups and other such organisations in County Monaghan many disabled persons would not be able to move about as freely as they do. We must pay tribute to the tremendous effort made by these groups. However, in an area where there is little transport and where the available transport is often inaccessible we must make the transport providers better aware of the need to make it more accessible and user friendly.</P>
    <P>People with disablements often have difficulty accessing information on their rights and allowances when procuring cars, or even chairs to go into cars, if they do not pass the tests set down by the local doctor at health board level. They must then appeal to Dublin. I recently encountered two cases where neither party was capable of travelling to the appeal in Dublin. People in that situation continue to lose out. That must be seriously considered. One lady wished to travel to mass only once or, perhaps on the odd occasion, twice a week and maybe travel with her daughter to sit in the town and watch people go by. Under her doctor's instruction she is unable to travel to Dublin for her appeal. Her daughter <Col N="303" /> had to give up work to look after her and, therefore, does not have the funds to buy a car unless she can get the tax and VAT relief. This type of case must be seriously looked at.</P>
    <P>Over the last two budgets the disabled only received an increase of £6 per week whereas old age pensioners received an increase of £11 per week. Given the scale of the funding that is now available there is no reason the disabled should be treated in this way. They should receive an increase that takes account of the extent to which they have slipped behind. They have been treated at the same level as the long-term unemployed. In a booming economy the latter have an opportunity to work and there are many schemes to address their needs, although they need to be better publicised and targeted better at those entitled to use them.</P>
    <P>However, in many cases the disabled cannot take up employment. It is wrong that they should be discriminated against. I know a young man who uses two crutches to walk who received an increase of £6 in the past two years, while his next door neighbour, a reasonably young and fit pensioner, received an increase of £11 while being able to hold down a full-time job. The Minister and his officials must ensure the disabled are cared for properly in this millennium year.</P>
    <P>I was not in the Dáil yesterday when the Minister answered questions, but I have had correspondence with him on this new brilliant farm assist scheme which was supposed to save thousands of farmers and their families &ndash; it is important to note that families are involved &ndash; from the dire problems which have beset the farming industry in recent years. The scheme was negotiated between the IFA, other farming organisations and the Minister's Department and was supposed to give farmers an additional £15 million to £20 million. A number of different figures were announced to the farming community. The Minister's information must have been wrong, because it is 18 months since the scheme was announced and the facts given by his Department and office are that no additional money has been spent on the scheme. Those who have been reassessed have in many cases had their incomes reduced.</P>
    <P>The means of assessment must be urgently re-examined. Social welfare officers do an excellent job in the main and I do not blame them for what is happening because they obviously follow guidelines. However, many older farmers are not well educated and do not have proper accounts structures. A simple example of this is a small farmer whom I accompanied to the social welfare office. He had little information except that he had five cows and a few other head of cattle. He was able to make little more than £3,000 on those five cows. The social welfare officer accepted that some things on the man's assessment could not be possible and adjusted it accordingly, and I appreciate that. Furthermore, this same farmer could not provide for the control of farmyard pol<Col N="304" /> lution scheme because of the size of his enterprise. Although it was supposed to be a ten year programme, he had to raise the money for the scheme in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Another case involved a man with 13 cows and about 30 other cattle. According to the social welfare officer, he was able to have them tested for TB and brucellosis, served with AI, dosed and have veterinary work carried out for a total cost of £300. That was placed in writing on the assessment form. Anyone who knows anything about agriculture knows it costs £16.50 for an AI service for each head of cattle which means the AI service alone cost £192. The test cost £200. That does not allow anything for dosing or veterinary costs. It would have amounted to a minimum of £600 and possibly nearer £700. On the other hand, on the sales side, the farmer was only allowed lose 5 per cent. Anyone who knows anything about the farming conditions last year and some of the sad cases which have gone to court as a result, knows that, through starvation and sickness, many farmers lost much more than 5 per cent. That must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>A learning process needs to take place for social welfare officials at participant and Department levels if this scheme is to serve its purpose. The Minister, his support team and the farm organisations, when they devised this scheme, thought it might be useful. It has turned out to be a farce and I hope it will be re-examined as a matter of urgency. None of us on either side of the House wants people to starve unnecessarily. The funds have been provided and the steps must taken before it is too late to ensure these people receive their entitlements.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an t-ainm. Nuair a chonaic mé an t-ainm, &ldquo;Comhairle&rdquo;, shíl mé go roimh i bhfad níos mó i gceist i gComhairle ná mar a bheadh i gceist le h-eolas. Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Higgins ar maidin ag ardú na ceiste. Bheadh an-leisce orm fiú amháin iarracht a dhéanamh ar fhreagra a thabhairt ar dhuine chomh shaineolach leis an Teachta Higgins ar mhéad leathan ábhar. Dá bhrí sin, níor bhraith mé ar mo chuid eolas féin ach d'fhéach mé i bhfoclóir Uí Dhomhnaill &ndash; bíobla nua na Gaeilge &ndash; agus chonaic mé go bhfuil dhá mhíniú ag baint leis an bhfocal &ldquo;comhairle&rdquo;, siad sin &ldquo;advice or counsel&rdquo; agus &ldquo;council&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;advice and counsel&rdquo; sums up what is meant by the Bill. It is about much more than giving information. It gives people a direction, a service and access to a wide range of services and information to enable them make decisions, to become stronger and to empower themselves to be able to deal with the information when they receive it. Bhí an-áthas orm nár cuireadh an teideal &ldquo;An Bille Eolais&rdquo; ar an mBille, mar ní bheadh brí dá laghad ag baint leis. Ag féachaint <Col N="305" /> ar an bhfocal &ldquo;comhairle&rdquo;, tuigim go díreach céard atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím ach go háirithe that it is the Irish version of the word which is being used. Too often in Bills, boards or establishments we have moved away from using the Irish language version towards using the English language version. The more opportunities we can give people to keep the Irish version as the official one, the better it will be for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to give a structure to and to mainstream the provision of information so it is available to all people, especially those with disabilities. The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is an enormous tome which deals with a wide variety of topics: legal status, transport, access, technology, women and vulnerable people. Before it deals with any of those rights, there is a full section entitled: &ldquo;Delivering the Necessary Services&rdquo;, as though acknowledging that it does not matter what rights and services exist for people if they do not know how to access them to retain them. The report states that people with disabilities were frustrated in getting information about their entitlements and in accessing these from a multiplicity of agencies. It recommended a single network which would give information, advice, support and advocacy.</P>
    <P>The report recognises that information is the key to equality and independence and that, while it must be available to all people, it also needs to be co-ordinated so it can be used by all people who attain it. The centralisation of information, in the form of a disability support service, was one of the central recommendations of that report. This Bill goes one step further in that it does not segregate information for the disabled from information for anyone else. It seeks to ensure all people are treated equally in a positive manner and recognises that information is essential for all citizens. The Bill carries through on one of the three main principles recognised in the commission report, that of equality. The Comhairle Bill will ensure equality of access to information.</P>
    <P>The NRB has played, and continues to play, a very valuable role in providing information. A number of other voluntary groups and specialised organisations also provide an information service and need our continuing support. Difficulties have arisen because such a variety of Departments and agencies provide information. Those services must be co-ordinated, supported and directed. An Comhairle, an focal sin arís, is required so that people will know where to turn.</P>
    <P>I recently met a young, highly intelligent and motivated girl with an excellent job who had just been diagnosed with advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa. She contacted one of the organisations which deals with the blind to find out what her entitlements would be, what retraining would be available to her, where she could turn to for employment and what supports she could expect to receive. She contacted them in January but had <Col N="306" /> not heard anything by September when she contacted me. It took six weeks for me to obtain the information. This girl is not yet disabled but is faced with the trauma of knowing that she will be blind in a very short time. Having obtained the information she requested, I discovered she needs to turn to a variety of agencies to obtain the assistance she requires to enable her to cope with her disability and to ensure she can continue to lead the type of life she currently leads. I hope Comhairle, in its co-ordination of information services, will work with all of the service providers to ensure this girl and people like her can obtain information and advice speedily and efficiently.</P>
    <P>In our role as public representatives, we have all encountered people who need information. I could point to the case of my friend Gerry, a Thalidomide victim and formerly a highly successful secondary school teacher, who runs choirs, organises musicals and drives his car in a manner which must be seen to be believed. Having completed a law degree, he changed his career direction into law at which stage he started to encounter problems. He approached me to find out whether any assistance would be available to allow a solicitor's company to adapt if it were to take him on as an apprentice. He wanted to know whether he would be entitled to a home help given that his home situation had changed and what assistance he could avail of from the local authority or the health board. He is not in a system because he is not in receipt of social welfare but he does require advice and information. I hope Comhairle, through its various organisations and information structures, will be able to assist him. I hope it will assist me as someone who receives requests for information. How am I, a TD of two years' standing, to know what is necessary to help these people? At least, I know where to turn to for the information and can avail of the back-up and support of Departments such as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs whose staff give freely and willingly of their time. Individuals should have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information and should not have to wait for me to get it for them. People should be able to obtain the information for themselves at a local level.</P>
    <P>The issue of the address of the major body, be it the NRB, NSSB or Comhairle, was raised. Does it matter whether the address is Ballsbridge, Ballymun, Ballybough or Ballybrack? Does it matter whether it is located in Raheen, Moneen, Southill or Malin Head? What matters is that people in all of these areas would be able to obtain information. Information is essential for everyone, irrespective of where people live or what their abilities or disabilities are. I welcome the fact that the Bill combines the work of the NRB, which focused on people with disabilities, with the work of the NSSB which operates citizens' information centres.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister opened a new office for an existing service in Dún Laoghaire which pro<Col N="307" /> vides free, confidential, expert and impartial information. People have worked there in a voluntary capacity for many years and they have more information than I could ever hope to have. These people, in their new offices, with the support and back-up of technology and Departments, can empower people to make decisions and can assist them to deal with all of the services. It does not matter where people live or what their backgrounds are; people need advice and information whether they have sufficient or insufficient income or whether they live in private or council accommodation.</P>
    <P>An elderly couple came to see me this week. They do not have any family and they wanted to inquire about nursing home beds and sheltered independent living and to obtain medical information and information on basic maintenance, such as who they should contact if the water boiler burst. I hope Comhairle will be able to assist these people, through its co-ordination of services, in the same way as it will assist those who are already in the system.</P>
    <P>The money advice and budgeting bureaus, one of which is located in Dún Laoghaire, will also be assisted by this Bill. There is a need to advertise the availability of MABS, citizens' information centres and any other information centres set up under the aegis of Comhairle. Such publicity is required so that people will know to whom they can turn for advice in their local areas, the service opening hours, the information that is available and that the services are open to everyone. People of all ages and from all backgrounds require advice. The aim of this Bill is to treat people equally, to empower them and make them independent. When the body has been established and the services have been co-ordinated, let us inform people of its availability and offer them choices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will result in the amalgamation of the NRB and the NSSB which have done valuable work over the years. It is now time to move on. The objective of the amalgamation is to provide greatly enhanced services for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the past, many people participated in training courses outside the FÁS system. As someone who worked with FÁS in the past, that resulted in the compartmentalisation of people with disabilities. At one stage, I was involved in the apprenticeship aspect of training and visited various companies in Cork where the National Rehabilitation Board trained people in upholstery and carpet making. Those people were trained as a separate entity and were then taken on by local employers. It is desirable that people with disabilities train in a natural environment as that allows them to network with other people at a later stage. That should happen in the future. Many of the changes which have taken place are positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the Dáil and various organis<Col N="308" /> ations have spoken about local authorities, health boards and State bodies employing a certain percentage of people with disabilities. In many cases the targets have not been achieved. When local authorities and health boards advertise vacancies, which are open to all, people with disabilities no longer apply because they do not believe they have a chance. If we are to achieve the targets set down, human resources sections in health boards and local authorities should actively encourage people with disabilities to apply for positions. I read recently that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government had repeated what previous Ministers said about the percentage in local authorities and different organisations. Unless personnel sections are encouraged to move in that direction, that percentage will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>We put barriers in the way of people with disabilities entering mainstream employment. One barrier is that some of the organisations for which they might work are not wheelchair friendly or wheelchair accessible. Making sure such buildings are accessible involves a certain amount of expenditure. The person who is not in a wheelchair will not cost the organisation any expense in terms of making it wheelchair accessible or wheelchair compatible and in that case, the person with a disability does not a have a real opportunity. Rather than setting targets, personnel sections should be directed to actively encourage people with disabilities to apply for positions and they should, as a matter of policy, make their building accessible and wheelchair friendly.</P>
    <P>I live in Newcastle West where a group called Access got together. There is also a Cheshire Home close by and when those in wheelchairs came on their weekly visit to Newcastle West, they found that many of the footpaths in the town and the banking institutions were not accessible. It has been a long process getting the local authority &ndash; I am sure the same applies to other local authorities &ndash; and the different institutions in the town, particularly those in older buildings, to ensure their buildings were wheelchair friendly. It is sad that a voluntary organisation is needed to give stimulus to something which should happen. We have got over that difficulty as a result of our recent policy on buildings. New buildings must be wheelchair accessible and wheelchair friendly.</P>
    <P>The standard local authority house is a three bedroomed two storey semi-detached or terraced house but how many times have situations arisen where a young person is confined to a wheelchair and requires a bungalow? The housing section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government needs to be more innovative in terms of housing policy. To what degree do we ensure that what we put in place is wheelchair accessible or wheelchair friendly? When trying to accommodate the person or the family concerned, we usually build an extra bedroomed or a bathroom and shower downstairs. Imagination is required in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I recently met a group from the West Limerick Centre for Independent Living. It has done much work over a short period. Many of those confined to wheelchairs are extremely bright and very computer literate but they need a personal assistant or somebody to guide them when required. The policy in respect of personal assistants has been very progressive. The health boards and FÁS have helped to some degree, but there appears to be an <i>ad hoc </i>approach to this matter. That is why 500 personal assistants were sought in their budget submission. The type of money involved would not be much in the context of a buoyant economy but it would give much dignity to their lives. If we take steps in the right direction, we will show a positive approach to the area of disability.</P>
    <P>I have read much legislation recently which tries to accommodate this segment of the community. It is time to stop pay lip service in terms of legislation. We need to do something tangible. Some £40 billion is available for the National Development Plan. We have a buoyant economy and a budget surplus of £6 billion. Now is the time to address physical and mental handicap. If we do not address it when we have a buoyant economy, we never will. The argument used in the past was that because of the economic situation, we could not address it. We have no excuse and politicians deserve to be castigated if they do not move in a positive direction.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in the past year people in wheelchairs have protested outside the gates of the House, often in bad weather, to put pressure on us, as national politicians, to give them the status they deserve. I hope we can address that in the next budget. That is why the motion before the House last night was timely.</P>
    <P>My community is attempting a very laudable project called the Desmond resources complex which caters for young and old and people in wheelchairs who will have access to hydrotherapy pools and so on. We are trying to raise £l million for phase one. I have heard people speak about millennium projects and about the money being spent on such projects. At times I question our priorities because when the documentation relating to this project was put before the millennium committee, it was not even considered. Yet other projects, which have received financial aid, will be transient in terms of what is achieved. In this case, we are trying to do something which would have long-term implications for the community we serve and the people we represent.</P>
    <P>I wonder about our priorities. As this Bill emanated from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, I would like to raise an issue. Recently, elderly women came to me crying. Their means were reviewed because they were getting a few pounds more as their UK pensions were being paid in sterling and their widows or widowers non-contributory pension was reduced because of the strength of sterling. They have not been reviewed since 1993. The officials said they were sorry but that their pension is <Col N="310" /> means tested and that it was being revised accordingly and that the amount they would receive would be reduced by £20 to £25. They said it was interesting that no representative from the Department came to them when the punt was stronger than sterling to give some compensation. Widows getting a reduced pension because their late husbands worked in England found that reduction a real burden. It is a pity those pensions were reviewed now on the basis of punt and sterling values. That was extreme and a regressive decision. Public representatives have ongoing contact with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, as we deal with many people who have problems with social welfare, though I cannot praise departmental officials at local and national level enough for their efficiency. The Department's level of computerisation has been particularly effective and other Departments should follow its example. Over the past few years Ministers in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have ensured that the Department is efficient.</P>
    <P>However, even if one is efficient one should also have a heart, which was not the case with the decision concerning these 850 widows and widowers. This was a mean stroke in a buoyant economy. Who instructed officials to review this case after six years? It was a distasteful and unpalatable decision in the context of the economy. Many of us have had wage increases and are used to a certain level of money. If someone told us that we would get £25 less next week, how would we feel? We would be sick and sore. The widows and widowers concerned were accustomed to a certain amount of money and decreasing that amount was regressive.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister on the Adjournment and I received a bland answer that non-contributory pensions are means tested and that it was tough luck and nothing could be done. The officials provided a bland answer, but if a pay level they were used to was lowered, they would not like it. I hope if the punt improves relative to sterling that the adjustment will be made in the opposite direction. Since the introduction of the euro the gap has become wider and the punt is now worth 80p sterling, which is quite a gap.</P>
    <P>I welcome the developments in the area of disability. There has been much legislation in this area and there has been a lot of positive movement. However, much of this movement in aspirational and such aspirations can only be achieved when funding is provided. We must put our money where our mouths are and we have a chance to do so in the next budget and in coming years. I do not want another situation like the one I heard about recently.</P>
    <P>The manager of a Brothers of Charity workshop told me that the level of funding for respite care is so small that people cannot be accommodated. He dealt with the case of the death of an elderly person looking after a daughter with Down's Syndrome. The elderly person died and was dead for several days when the gardaí broke <Col N="311" /> down the door of the house. The daughter did not know what was wrong and the manager had to accommodate her immediately, but he could not do so because of his limited resources. People like Ger South in Limerick are crusaders in the area of mental handicap and a certain amount of money has been allocated to this sector. Now is our chance to address this area once and for all. If we do not do so in this budget or in coming years we should be ashamed of ourselves as politicians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Bill. I compliment the Minister on his initiative in trying to help those on the margins. He has a great record in this area since taking office. This Bill means he will have to interact with areas outside his brief, such as the Department of Health and Children and equality authorities, and he is doing so excellently.</P>
      <P>The Minister is anxious for the Bill to progress to Committee Stage when we will be able to put questions to him. In welcoming the Bill I particularly compliment the NRB on their work over the years. I have interacted with that body as chairman of the Southern Health Board and in connection with individual projects. Their work, both nationally and in my constituency, is to be lauded and the organisation has an excellent track record. Merging portions of their brief will help the NRB as extra funding will probably be released to it and this will help its general work.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will ask the Minister about some projects I hope will continue. For the last two years I have been trying to persuade the rehabilitation sector that a rehabilitation hospital should be built in the Cork sector of the Southern Health Board area. We have come a long way with that proposal; Rehab has committed itself to fund raising and the Southern Health Board has also committed itself when my proposal for establishing such a unit was adopted. I seek an assurance that this type of project will continue.</P>
      <P>There are financial implications in the Bill. There will be a transfer of funds from the Department of Health and Children and I would like to see far greater interaction between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department o Health and Children. Much of their work falls into a grey area between these Departments, particularly when dealing with the handicapped. The Minister has done tremendous work in the area of accessibility for the handicapped, but much of this work should probably be done by the Department of Health and Children. There should be greater interaction between Departments, as some of them seem to ring-fence their funding and their motto seems to be &ldquo;what we have we hold&rdquo;. The Department of Social, Community and Affairs provides many services for which funding might be transferred from other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a reciprocal agreement with the United Kingdom, where many Irish people have <Col N="312" /> lived, but is there any board in that country which will mirror Comhairle? We are trying to exchange and give equal benefits to people who may have worked in the UK before being handicapped, for example, so that they can draw their benefits here. Is there an equivalent to Comhairle in the UK? We had difficulties in the past finding equivalent bodies in other countries, though we have overcome many of those problems. That has been done through the efforts of the Minister, the Minister of State and their predecessors.</P>
    <P>We should be pragmatic in our approach to these issues, particularly those which concern the handicapped. We should move speedily. Legislation is not always required, though this Bill is part of the process of modernisation and relates to the distribution of information. Many speakers have referred to this aspect of the Bill but, even though greater resources are available in this age of technology, there are more ways of conveying information, I am concerned that people are not aware of their entitlements or from where to obtain information. Deputy Hanafin referred to a lady who tried to act in time when her sight started to fail but found it impossible to obtain information and had to consult her. The gap between the distribution and receipt of services is increasing. I know the Minister is concerned about this and he has visited family and community centres to assess their suitability for distributing information. It must be distributed in the community. For various reasons, including illiteracy, many notices are not read; perhaps people ignore them because of the volume issued. There are also television advertisements but people do not get the exact information they require. I am concerned about this, although I acknowledge what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>The one-stop shop is an excellent concept but it should be on the high street and available to the maximum number of people. Health boards should be instructed to notify people that all their services are available at that location. It is no longer acceptable for a person to go to a health board office for a medical card application form and be told it is available from another location perhaps four or five miles away. It is the duty of employees to ensure the service is provided. It is incumbent on those who are paid, the health boards and local authorities, to provide that service and to ensure the person looking for it is not inconvenienced. I have had previous experience of this and it is changing rapidly. I pay tribute to those involved. Many speakers referred to the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who have been innovative in trying to help people. Notification of changes in the payment of benefits are often not read by those who are entitled to them. For example, information on the number of contributions required and the criteria for benefits is often not available and, therefore, people may not apply. If that information were provided in community centres and by local resident groups, it would pay dividends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> I would like the board to advocate the employment of people with disabilities. A conference on this was held under the auspices of the EU funded Horizon programme to help the handicapped, which has been very successful. There is an ongoing debate about the establishment of a quota in the private sector. However, first we should get our own house in order. We have fail dismally to reach the 3 per cent target for employing people with disabilities, which is a tiny figure, even though it was increased. This included more people in the scheme but the number of those employed has not been increased. The target has not been increased and the quota is still not being reached. If it cannot be done in the public service, what hope is there that it will be done in the private sector? There are arguments for and against the quota system but, because of my experience, I would argue for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane referred to the health boards. Every six months I meet the chief executive officer and the city manager in Cork to ask them about the figures and if we have reached the target. Some Departments and offices have failed abysmally to meet the quota, including the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation where 0.8 per cent of the 126 staff are handicapped. The lowest figure is for the Chief State Solicitor's Office which employs a mere 0.5 per cent of people with disabilities among its 120 staff. That is easy to calculate. However, other Departments and offices should be lauded, including the Central Statistics Office, where 5.4 per cent of the staff come within the definition of handicapped, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources where 4.5 per cent of the 418 staff suffer from disabilities and the Department of Defence where 4.8 per cent of the 458 staff are handicapped. I know the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, is concerned at the failure to reach targets. The Departments who reach the target should be examined to see what approach they adopted. It is unsatisfactory that we set such a low target and then failed to reach it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is always willing to act in all areas. However, often what we ask him to do is outside his brief. I welcome the merger of the NRB and the NSSB. The bureaucracy concerning the handicapped should be looked at in all areas. This was discussed in relation to the Education (Welfare) Bill yesterday and there are also social and health aspects. The amount of bureaucracy should be examined to discover the impediments to establishing, that magical word, &ldquo;equality&rdquo; for those we are discussing. Deputy Finucane said &ldquo;we will put our money where our mouth is&rdquo; and spend money in the budget, etc. However, the &ldquo;we&rdquo; to which he referred is this side of the House although the Opposition did do something in the past. Despite a great deal of talk, all parties failed to deliver for people with disabilities. It has been said they have no voice &ndash; a declaration <Col N="314" /> with which I disagree. Members on both sides of this House have a consistent track record on this issue and are concerned about it. Bureaucracy often impedes progress and I want that examined. As Deputy Finucane said, we will all have different priorities in the budget, but the handicapped will be a priority. There is a major commitment to social inclusion in the programme for Government and in the national plan, which will allocate £40 billion. We should all have a say in deciding which issues should be given priority and there should be co-operation between all groups.</P>
    <P>While criticising certain Departments, I should mention what is being done by others. I referred to the difficulty with communication. However, the latest series of newsletters issued by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is brilliant. In the past, information booklets on pensions were a catch-all effort. There is a breakdown and a separate booklet which is described as a newsletter for old age non-contributory pensioners, contributory pensioners and others. I laud the efforts of the people involved and the Minister who is giving leadership. It is a most enlightened approach because often too much is crammed into documents. People tend to look for information on what concerns them and do not read to the end of documents. I compliment the Minister on this initiative and I ask him to continue that approach because something has gone wrong regarding the distribution of information.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill will be developed as the debate proceeds. I welcome the general thrust of the legislation but aspects of it will be questioned on Committee Stage. I appeal to the Minister to consider the number of these people employed in the public sector. I understand the overall percentage is 1.7%, which represents 3,050 persons from a total staff of 178,980. Why is the percentage so low? I am extremely worried about this matter.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the social inclusion strategy will enable the Minister to get money from the Department of Finance to promote his programmes. I wish him well in that regard. I compliment him on the Bill and I recommend its passage. We will have an opportunity to raise further questions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak after Deputy Dennehy and I compliment him on his detailed contribution in relation to our achievements on the inclusion of those with disabilities. When I was the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the location of the Department of Equality and Law Reform upstairs in the same building was not the only reason action was taken. We were committed to it and there were regular reviews, at least annually, of the departmental targets, which were met. However, the Deputy is correct to emphasise his disappointment at the achievements of other Departments and State and semi-State agencies in meeting the quota which has been set down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> I agree with the Deputy regarding its importance in terms of international experience that, where achievements such as these are expressed as targets, they are usually met in the public sector in the short-term but they are not met in the medium to long-term in the private sector. It is important to evolve from the achievement of such quotas in the public sector to their achievement in every area of society.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify my question on the Order of Business regarding the title of the new agency. I am not indulging in semantics but the term &ldquo;comhairle&rdquo; in the drafting of legislation and the establishment of bodies in the history of the State has usually preceded the proper noun, such as the Comhairle na nEalaíon, which is the Arts Council, and Comhairle na n-Ospidéal, which is the council of hospitals. One could find many other examples. My argument is that the new body should be called something like Comhairle Eolais which would be a generative and better usage of the term.</P>
    <P>I am making this point because it is important that when the Irish language is used to give names to parties, go mbainfimis an úsáid is ceart agus is cóir astu. There is an example in section 6(1), Part II, where it is stated there shall stand established on the establishment day a body to be known as Comhairle, in this Act referred to as the board, which shall perform the functions conferred on it by or under this Act. The question is left open &ndash; it is the board of what? One cannot say the board of board or the comhairle of Comhairle. With due respect to the enlightened contribution of Deputy Hanafin in this regard, it is an inelegant and inappropriate use of the term.</P>
    <P>Ag baint úsáid as Foclóir Uí Dhomhnaill, dúirt sí go raibh níos mó i gceist i gcomhairle ná eolas amháin agus tá an ceart aici. Ní hamháin go bhfuil eolas i gceist ach go bhfuil tú ag cabhrú leis an chaoi in a bhfuil tú agus leis an chuspóir atá agat ag cur an eolais ar fáil. An deacracht atá ag baint leis sin ná go bhfuil advocacy i gceist freisin.</P>
    <P>The Bill later states that it will provide information, advice and advocacy. As the Deputy pointed out, information would have been &ldquo;eolas&rdquo; and advice &ldquo;comhairle&rdquo;, but advocacy is also included. A better title for the agency might have been Tacú, but that would have an uncomfortable proximity to another notorious organisation, the fruits of whose existence are haunting us at the end of the 1990s. However, if one was to rely on the Ó Domhnaill usage in the fóclóir, it probably would have been closer to the three declared aims of the legislation.</P>
    <P>However, that is a minor point in relation to the overall welcome I have for the Bill. It is important legislation in terms of the advancement of the implementation of the report and the co-ordination and better availability of services to those with disabilities who need them. One of the reasons I was anxious to contribute to the debate is that almost 20 years ago there was a debate on the balance between the State and the voluntary sector in <Col N="316" /> relation to the provision of services. If I recall it correctly, it may have been sponsored by the NSSB during the time of the distinguished participation of Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness.</P>
    <P>A seminar was held to discuss the remit of the State and the voluntary sector, a debate which has taken place in other European countries, at a time when there was a significant debate on social policy. In this regard, it is my opinion that the former President, Dr. Patrick Hillery, has never received sufficient credit for his contribution when he was a Commissioner in relation to the evolution of the debate on social policy. Others were involved but I particularly recall that aspect.</P>
    <P>The argument was that the provision of State services met a declared need, were usually funded in response to the availability of funds from the Exchequer and, therefore, were open and accountable. Members could ask a parliamentary question about the provision of a service and a citizen could seek a judicial review of a service once it was established. One could seek an order of <i>mandamus </i>insisting on one's right. However, on the down side, it was suggested that sometimes these were administered in a narrow and categorical manner which did not take account of special circumstances.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector suggested that it could respond to the particulars of a case with greater discretion, that it could deal with cases that were in between different provisions and that it was more innovative. However, on the down side, frequently it was not as accountable as State provision and the question remained, how does one meet the rights of the citizen in a way that is inclusive of the best efforts of the voluntary sector but which has the legal certainty, openness, transparency and accountability of State provision?</P>
    <P>My view at that time was that there was still a long way to go in relation to expanding the State provision, and I put my own efforts into that category. I was also worried about the remit of the voluntary sector in so far as some categories of need were more highly organised than others. There was an uneven picture in relation to the ability of people who relied primarily on the voluntary sector. However, it is clear that what was necessary then and what has been needed since, and towards which we are beginning to grope our way, is a charter or a balance of co-operation between State and voluntary provision.</P>
    <P>There is no longer any excuse in times of surplus to argue that the voluntary provision should be anything other than the innovative provision. It should not be a substitute for State provision. That case has disappeared. Those who have been supplying services and assistance the State should have provided have a right to feel abused in the sense that they filled gaps and were regarded as a substitute for State provision.</P>
    <P>One matter will always be important in the voluntary sector, its ability to identify new needs ahead of the State system. From the time legislation was passed and ministerial instruments put <Col N="317" /> in place, the State system tended to protect its boundaries. I will not burden the House with the quasi-constitutional, at best, but really unconstitutional role of the Department of Finance in relation to other Departments, something about which I intend to continue to speak. It does not have a constitutional basis nor is it specified in the Ministers and Secretaries Act of the 1920s. It is a practice that grew out of what is termed in the Department &ldquo;the principle of continuity&rdquo; which can be decoded to mean &ldquo;we got away with it for years and we should be able to get away with it&rdquo;. Therefore, it slid, with a sort of sleight of hand, the practices of the British Treasury into the early practices of the Irish State. Seven years after the establishment of the Irish State, British Treasury officials went home and said they were satisfied things could carry on more or less as they were. That type of dead hand approach in Departments should be ended. I pay tribute to the Minister who is taking a new approach. He has my support in trying to shake off that practice in some sort of constitutional manner. I must emphasise this is not a constitutional power.</P>
    <P>On the question of centralisation, the difficulty about the administration of many State services is the absence of delegated discretion. I know of very few states in Europe which have as little delegated discretion as the Irish. It is ridiculous that administration requires so much consent from the top. I would be pleased if someone could prove me wrong in this belief. The difficulty with receiving a service lies in the way in which it is delivered. However, there has been a welcome change in the ethos which prevails, although those on the ground regularly refer to their difficulties in relation to clearances permitted. I am in favour of looser legislation to allow maximum discretion.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised an interesting concept when he said the Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges associated with citizenship and that all obstacles to the enjoyment of these privileges should be removed. He is correct. However, he referred later to achieving greater equality. One is either equal or not. By any deconstruction, &ldquo;greater equality&rdquo; means there is inequality. One can speak about &ldquo;reduced inequality&rdquo; or &ldquo;greater equality&rdquo; but, frankly, &ldquo;reduced inequality&rdquo; is the more accurate usage.</P>
    <P>Most who are involved in this area would be perfectly willing to specify what they mean by &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. Equality means not only equality of provision across the statutes of the legislation, but also equality in one's discretion in terms of the right to choose. People with disabilities will, in different circumstances, exercise choice in, for example, their decisions to seek a State provision where it is provided. They may or may not seek provision from the voluntary sector and &ndash; this is only now beginning to be discussed among the different groups &ndash; the disabled person with special needs has the right to purchase the services he or she need to achieve their full citizenship rights. That third component is interesting <Col N="318" /> from because the person seeking equality will raise this issue. If one were to argue from a citizenship point of view about one's right to participate fully in society and to find what one requires to meet one's needs, for example, from the State, the voluntary sector or in the marketplace, why should a disabled person, to which the Minister referred, or a person with special needs be singularly precluded from purchasing what he or she needs, if it is available? I am referring, for example, to hiring a special companion or assistant, a special type of computer or purchasing something that person needs, be it human or material. If one is to achieve equality in terms of participation under the theory of citizenship, one must acknowledge the strategies available to any citizen to meet his or her needs in different ways. This issue will surface. However, I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the principle of citizenship in his speech.</P>
    <P>The report adopted three guiding principles &ndash; equality, maximising participation and enabling independence of choice. What I have just said deals with the issue of independence of choice. Maximising participation means having a run right across the institutional nexus of the society in which the person participates from childhood to late adulthood. This raises many issues about not just education but about other forms of social participation, and it extends beyond the marketplace. One of the welcome distinctive aspects of Irish politics &ndash; I frequently note its negative characteristics &ndash; is that we may be ahead of the posse in abandoning the notion that the marketplace will ever deliver rights to people. The structure of the market as a provider probably received its most extensive application in the New Zealand economy a few years ago. It is there the greatest complete internal collapse in market theory is taking place. It was a nightmare in terms of what it managed right across the spectrum from social provisions to special care. Of its nature, this collapse was almost inevitable. There was a great debate between Professor Titmuss, the great advocate of public health in Britain and of universal social coverage, and Professor Acton who developed the idea of a market mechanism in the provision of rights in Britain. Acton's theories led to the complete distortion of the pension provision in Britain and to the barbarism of the Thatcher years.</P>
    <P>In 1999, we should celebrate that we survived the Thatcher-Reagan period with its comprehensive destruction of solidarity, social care and so on. It was a singularly miserable and narrow piece of scholarship invented by Friedrich von Hayek and used by unprincipled politicians to try to row us back to the 18th century.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Bill is limited in what it sets out to do. It provides a new mechanism for the provision of information, advice and advocacy. I have used the information leaflets of the NSSB for many years. I pay tribute to the board, not only for the way in which it generally distributed information but for small simple things <Col N="319" /> which it saw early on, such as providing information in a way which could be stored easily even in a time when we had ring-binders, and also its attempt to disseminate its information widely. I welcomed the provision of information at that time.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the use which was made of that information differed in many parts of the country. For example, it is a great pity that the editors of national and of provincial newspapers did not build on the fine example of some of their number. Some of them ran columns based on the information which was available generally and, in doing so, enhanced the dissemination of the information.</P>
    <P>I need not delay on the detail of the Bill. I hope that the section providing for the transition of the staff's conditions and pay includes adequate provision for pension. I think the provision is similar to that of other legislation.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies said, I hope we get to a point where the Bill will be taken as a signal to all agencies that they should try to be aware of what everyone else is doing so inquiries initiated at any part of the service provision network, will immediately be able to be relayed to points of more appropriate assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of Comhairle I understand, is to combine services provided by the National Social Services Board with certain disability support functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. The Bill provides for mainstreaming the provision of services for people with a disability and in that regard I cautiously welcome it.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to both boards, for which I have the height of admiration and respect because of the Trojan work and information which they provide to the community and society at large. The NSSB provides a tremendous source of information and knowledge and is a great support to a large number of citizens information centres and voluntary community centres. The NRB also does great work, providing valuable support functions.</P>
      <P>I understand Comhairle will be the mainstream support agency for information services. The Minister stated in his speech that it will be &ldquo;for all people, including those with disabilities.&rdquo;  I would be grateful if he would provide clarification on the level of support for all people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge and pay tribute to the volunteer army of people who operate in the community and provide valuable supports for people in need. I pay tribute to the organisations working in the constituency of Dublin North-Central. Long before its time, we were fortunate to have the Council for Co-ordination of Social Services in Sybil Hill in Raheny. It has done exactly what many organisations need to do, that is bring together various components to provide the best information and support service which can be provided to those in need. I congratulate those who founded the centre some 25 years ago, some <Col N="320" /> of whom are still involved, but in particular, the principal, Ms Eileen Hutchinson, and her team. Across the constituency of Dublin North-Central there are many other people working in the community providing an enormous support, which on occasions goes unrecognised and, indeed, even unnoticed by those other than the people in need of the service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the mainstreaming of support service agencies at a central level as is provided for in the Bill. While I appreciate the focus on people with a disability, I am equally concerned that some of the general citizen information which heretofore was provided by the NSSB should continue to be available. I found the NSSB helpful in this regard. Its service proved beneficial to those in need of such information and I hope the Minister in his reply will highlight that this role will continue.</P>
    <P>When one compares some of the services available to different groups of people, one group about which I am concerned is the homeless. There are a number of people, who are not <i>au fait</i> with the services which should be available to them and cannot tap into them too easily. At a recent health board meeting I was somewhat surprised and disappointed to learn, when I read a document outlining the array of services and supports which are rightly available to asylum seekers and asked for a comparison with the services which were available for the homeless, that the homeless were not able to avail of a number of services of which one would expect any individual in those circumstances would be easily able to avail. Will the Minister clarify that the support agency will provide information services for all people and, in particular, the homeless? What exact role will Comhairle play in that regard?</P>
    <P>I am pleased, following that meeting, to have pioneered a project for the homeless in Dublin between Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board at Park Gate Hall. As chairman of the Eastern Health Board, I hope to make an announcement on that later in the year. It is a group of people for whom I have genuine concern. It is a sad reflection on society that we still have so many people sleeping rough on our streets.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for providing that people with disabilities will be treated the same as their fellow citizens by having services delivered to them by this mainstream agency which will provide that service to the rest of the community. I hope the Minister will expand on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this represents a significant change of approach in that to date people with a disability had their services provided <i>via</i> the Department of Health and Children. Services have been provided from a health perspective rather than that which is outlined here. This is a radical change which will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am also encouraged by the Minister's statement that &ldquo;The new mainstreaming approach now proposed is not intended to replace such measures but to operate in parallel with them&rdquo;. <Col N="321" /> However, I am concerned because the body to which I referred, the Council for the Co-ordination of Social Services, which is based at Sybil Hill, Raheny, made an application to the Department in respect of funding for IT facilities which was turned down. If we are determined to promote participation in society and encourage people to access information, it is important to ensure that Comhairle has sufficient funds available to it or that it has the authority to ensure that the necessary funds will be provided to those bodies that are able to improve, enhance and develop the services they already offer. Will the Minister indicate how Comhairle will be funded and what additional funding will be made available to ensure that the groups associated with the NSSB and the NRB are supplied with the resources they require?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another issue relating to the NRB. An officer of the board has brought to my attention the complications that people with disabilities experience in terms of participating in society. I refer here to disabled drivers' and passengers tax concessions. There may be a need for a number of Ministers to jointly consider the feasibility of introducing appropriate amendments to primary medical certificates to ensure that people with disabilities can fully participate in society. I understand that the Department of Finance may be restricted in this regard but there could be tremendous benefits from the point of view of the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs. I ask the Ministers to come together to see what progress can be made.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the work invested both in terms of drafting the Bill and putting the necessary structures in place, I draw to the Minister's attention &ndash; he is aware of my record in this regard &ndash; the needs of those who provide home help and other caring services. The difficulties in these areas do not merely relate to funding, they also relate to the lack of people available to provide such services. This shortfall has been caused by the current economic climate and the availability of other work, for which people are being well paid. By whom are the home helps who provide essential services in the community employed? There is shyness on the part of various Departments to reveal which of them has responsibility for these people. It is fair to say that without these people we could not survive. The same goes for carers.</P>
    <P>Another issue of concern to carers and home helps is the provision of training and other supports. I wholeheartedly support the strong case put forward by the Carers Association in respect of the improvements required by carers and home helps. For example, let us consider the case of a carer who has developed a close relationship with the person for whom they have cared over many months and years. What supports will be put in place to support such a carer when the said relationship is cut short as a result of the death of the person for whom they have cared? I am <Col N="322" /> aware of cases which merit the putting in place of special supports. Such supports do not exist, but they should. The same applies in respect of training and supports for home helps.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to state &ndash; I do this without the permission of the individual concerned but I have no doubt that, because of the publicity she has already received, she will appreciate me mentioning her name &ndash; that we should be proud that a person with a disability is currently participating in the Sydney Paralympics. I refer here to Patrice Dockery, an employee of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on whose behalf I made representations to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that she should not only be allowed to participate but that she should be given paid leave. I congratulate the Tánaiste for responding positively in that regard.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that individuals have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information, advice and advocacy services on the full range of social services. In that context, the provision of information is an essential element of the relationship between social service providers and the people who use their services. I wish to ensure that social service providers have access to the relevant IT facilities to allow them to promote such information. As we enter the new millennium, we must ensure that such facilities are put in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the first priority of Comhairle will be to ensure there is no disruption of services during the transition period. I congratulate him on including that provision in the Bill. I compliment him on his foresight and also on the radical approach he has taken to try to improve the services which are already in place but which have not yet been mainstreamed.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

These people would much prefer to have such information available on a parochial basis. I support the Minister's comments in respect of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to place on record my concern about the growing level of bureaucracy at local level. There has been a great deal of change at local level; local authorities have established a new layer of officialdom. The same is true at health board <Col N="323" /> level. In my area &ndash; which is part of the area covered by the Eastern Health Board &ndash; a proposed new board is coming on stream in March, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which will have three further boards under it. This will replace the Eastern Health Board. I am concerned about the operation of these boards and the impact this officialdom will have on the availability of the necessary information and services provided by such authorities. I can see the benefit of the appointment of one individual who will have responsibility for a total region.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that a National Millennium Committee, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="325" /> Séamus Brennan, has been advising the Government on appropriate projects and initiatives to celebrate the millennium. However, as I stated in reply to Question No. 38 of 7 October 1999, a number of events to mark the millennium are being planned and organised within my Department.</P>
      <P>For example, I have provided financial support to a project, led by Poetry Ireland, for the publication of an anthology of Irish poetry from the 20th century to be entitled &ldquo;Watching the River Flow&rdquo;. This is an appropriate cultural project to celebrate the literary achievements of the 20th century and will highlight the vitality and the continued relevance of Irish poetry as we approach the beginning of a new millennium.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Ceoil Reoite: Frozen Music&rdquo; millennium project has also been launched by me. This involves the commissioning of a number of distinguished Irish musicians to compose a signature tune for a selected list of national monuments and historic properties. I am glad to say that this has been a very successful initiative with 11 commissions completed to date.</P>
      <P>With the interim reports of the interdepartmental working group and the report of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama on the proposed academy for the performing arts, significant background work has been carried out. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and I will bring forward definitive proposals for the establishment of an Irish academy for the performing arts in the millennium year. This new institution, when created will have profound and beneficial effects on teaching and performance of the performing arts across many strata of society.</P>
      <P>The winter solstice at Newgrange passage tomb on 21 December, heralding the start of the new year and new millennium will be marked by a live television transmission from Newgrange by RTE in association with my Department.</P>
      <P>A number of additional programmes and events to mark the millennium are being planned by the national cultural institutions and other bodies which come within the remit of my Department.</P>

It demonstrates the relevance of Irish poetry as we approach the new millennium. That is just one of the many projects which have been looked at in the Department. It should be remembered that it is not just a question of the Department showing an interest, but the number of bodies under the aegis of my Department, for example, the national institutions &ndash; the National Museum, the National Library, the National Archives, the Chester Beatty Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Concert Hall, the National Gallery, the Heritage Council and Bord Scannáin na hÉireann.</P>

I agree with the Deputy that it is important that the millennium celebration endures and can be appreciated and not just have short-term benefits. That is why we have become involved in the projects to which I referred in my reply.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's questions regarding the millennium committee and millennium fund I should like to state that that is a matter for the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, who is the chairman of the millennium committee. It is a separate committee and I am not responsible for its decisions on how it will spend money. A number of arts projects have been supported by the committee, which, of course, I welcome, support and appreciate. However, these projects are in addition to those undertaken by my Department and each national institution.</P>

      <P>The sites and monuments record &ndash; SMR &ndash; has been subsumed by the statutory record of monuments and places under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. The original survey records and related archival material which form the basis of the record of monuments and places are extensive. These records, covering all counties except Cork, Galway and parts of Donegal, are kept in the Archaeological Survey of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department in 51 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, which is also the headquarters of the Office of Public Works. It has been the practice of my Department to make these accessible to the public to facilitate more detailed inquiries and research. Until recently, this material could be viewed on Mondays by appointment from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. The Cork and Galway archaeological archive can be viewed in the archaeological departments in UCC and UCG. The Donegal archive can be viewed in Letterkenny Museum.</P>
      <P>On the question of access to the full Archaeological Survey records, the position is that, as part of refurbishment works which are being carried out on the Office of Public Works's headquarters at 51 St. Stephen's Green, the consultation rooms at the entrance to the building, which are shared with Office of Public Works and would normally be available to the public for inspecting the Archaeological Survey records, were dismantled some weeks ago. This has given rise to problems of access to the records but alternative facilities have been arranged within the building and normal service, including professional advice on such matters as data searching and retrieval, has been resumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister stated that normal service has been resumed. However, 3,000 planning referrals were received last year while so far this year 4,000 have been received and because of the difficulties that pertain to these records, there is a major problem in planning whereby projects can be held up by up to 12 months. This can affect EU funded infrastructural projects? Does the Minister agree that there is a <Col N="328" /> crisis in terms of the need for extra staff as well as accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested by the figures quoted by the Deputy in his question but perhaps I can be more accurate. A total of 1,000 planning referrals were received in 1992 and 4,500 will have been dealt with by the end of this year, which is more than the Deputy quoted. The sheer level of economic development in the State in recent years has placed an enormous burden on the professional services in my Department, such as the archaeological service. However, the need to prioritise the existing resource led to the achievement of a major milestone last year when the full record of monuments and places was completed for 120,000 sites throughout the State. Marvellous work has been done on that and I thank the officials in my Department who have put in a tremendous amount of work. I agree with the Deputy that there has been an increase in the volume of work which perhaps is due in part to the Celtic tiger and the fact that more issues must be addressed. The numbers speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine but people involved in planning say that the situation is serious and, indeed, the system could face complete breakdown with all sorts of repercussions for planning and development. Will the Minister give an absolute assurance that the new measures implemented by her will result in proper and speedy processing &ndash;  and not in a haphazard way &ndash; of the various referrals and licence applications? I do not accept that there will be a substantial change in this seriously deteriorating situation, which could have awful repercussions for the construction industry and the development of the nation's infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a crisis in this regard. I already explained to the Deputy that great emphasis was put on the record of monuments and places, which has been completed. There are 120,000 sites and a great deal of manpower was required to complete the record. However, that information is now available to the public. The Deputy will also be aware that every section in every Department wants more staff because the specialisation of the modern world and the volume of work is increasing. There have been a number of extra referrals because of the economic boom. While I do not agree that there is a crisis, we would like to have more staff and I am addressing the issue.</P>

      <P>As Minister with primary responsibility for heritage I have initiated the <Col N="329" /> preparation of a national heritage plan that will set out strategies for the protection, conservation, management and presentation of the natural heritage; the architectural and archaeological heritage; both moveable and immovable; the inland waterways of the State and documentary and archival heritage.</P>
      <P>My Department has undertaken a broad public consultation process in regard to the development of the plan and 350 submissions were assessed and taken into account, as appropriate. A parallel preparatory process, which has also been under way within my Department, has included an overview of current management of the heritage with critical assessment and proposals for action. This ongoing work is being overseen by a steering group comprised of senior officials of my Department and representatives of the Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>It is intended that these processes will be completed in the coming months and that interdepartmental consultation will then be undertaken. It is anticipated that the plan will be published next year, following consideration by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Repercussions may occur as a result of this plan. The Minister, in documents published by her Department, such as &ldquo;The Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage&rdquo;, &ldquo;Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavation&rdquo; and its statement of strategy, referred specifically to her responsibility to provide appropriate policy, legislative, administrative and financial frameworks of all areas of heritage. From the archaeological perspective of the heritage plan, it will be impossible for a variety of reasons. There are 30 archaeologists employed by Dúchas, 11 permanent and 19 on temporary contracts which were deemed illegal by a court case. Given the 5,000 planning referrals people are being drawn from the protection of heritage into the planning area with the result that the efficiency and the professionalism of the service is being seriously diminished. Has the Minister prepared a plan, a projection and the cost because the matter will get worse? The heritage, movable and immovable, for which the Minister has political responsibility will be decimated given the projections in the national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked why am I initiating a national heritage plan and why do I think there is a need for such a plan. It is precisely because of the innovations and initiatives of recent years that we need to look not only at the legislation in this area but to put in place structures that will be effective following the new interest not only by the public but other agencies. It augurs well that we have had more than 350 submissions from the public and interested groups. The information in those submissions is being correlated. My Department is also looking at the whole question of structures, hence the reason for the steering group comprised of the <Col N="330" /> senior officials of my Department. I have also asked the representative from the Heritage Council to come on board because its work, which is separate from the Department, has been very effective. It is important to draw all this information together and to have a strategic plan for the future rather than a piecemeal approach to our heritage.</P>
      <P>Archaeology, while important, is one element of our heritage. In this heritage plan we are dealing with the natural heritage, archaeological heritage, architectural heritage, natural and cultural landscapes, inland waterways and the documentary on archival heritage. It is not only one section of our heritage that we have to look at. We have to outline the further needs to ensure the national heritage plan is a strategic way forward. That was something I proposed in Opposition. It is part of the programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium and we are carrying it through. It is not something that will be delivered from the top down. I spoke about this in Opposition and it is very much part of Government policy. We will be talking about local heritage plans, those of the local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government all of which play a major part in the recognition, preservation and conservation of our heritage. In recent years there is a recognition that something needs to be done. I am pleased the Government is taking action and will put those structures in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a long answer but it does not deal with the issues I raised. I invite the Minister to go through her Department and to meet the professional archaeologists. Has she put together a plan to sort the 5,000 referrals in 1999? Many of these are being moved from desks with &ldquo;refused&rdquo; written on them without the ability to check because of a lack of staff. Will the Minister deal with the issue of illegal employees in her Department arising from a court case? There are 19 archaeologists on temporary contracts in the archaeological section of Dúchas. This problem should be sorted out. Will the Minister discuss this matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and overrule the mandarins in the Department of Finance who want those on temporary contracts to go into the private sector? If not, her political remit as the preserver of the Irish heritage will be destroyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Cnoc is the official Irish form of Knock, County Mayo, as established by order in Statutory Instrument No. 133 of 1975, An tOrdú Logainmneacha (Foirmeacha Gaeilge) (Uimhir 1)(Postbhailte), 1975.</P>
      <P>The official Irish form, An Cnoc, was proposed by the Placenames Commission on the basis of collected evidence for the name in 1958. This form was published provisionally in Ainmneacha Gaeilge na mBailte Poist i gCúige Chonnacht, Liosta Sealadach (Oifig an tSoláthair, 1960) and comment was invited. It was ratified by the Commission and published in Ainmneacha Gaeilge na mBailte Poist (Oifig an tSoláthair, 1969).</P>
      <P>The Commission is composed of recognised scholars in the fields of Irish toponomy and related disciplines representing various areas of the country. When the Irish form of Knock was examined in 1958, the Commission included several scholars who were well acquainted with the history and placenames of Connacht. In deciding on An Cnoc as the official form of the name, it is likely that the Commission was influenced by the fact that this was the traditional form used by native Irish speakers in east Mayo at the beginning of this century and saw no reason to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying this matter. The remit of Coimisiún na Logainmneacha is to investigate the proper Irish names and to list and have them for signposting and so on. I thank the Minister of State for saying he will discuss this further with Coimisiún na Logainmneacha. There is not a person in County Mayo who does not associate Knock, in English, with the name Cnoc Mhuire, in Irish. It may well be that when the provisional list was published in <Col N="332" /> 1959, and followed subsequently by official publication, that people did not read as much then and were not aware, because of the lack of local radio and the media, of the importance of this. I think I can dispense with this and say on behalf of County Mayo and the province that the traditional understanding of the name of Knock in 1999 is the Irish version, Cnoc Mhuire. Will he instruct Coimisiún na Logainmneacha, despite the official literary correctness, that that is the title we want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the considerable historical evidence available, which goes back to 1625, that Cnoc was the version used in Irish. However, we have to accept that times change. Because of the apparition at Knock and the religious significance in the last century I accept that the present modern usage of the Irish form of Knock, is now Cnoc Mhuire. I would also accept if you said to somebody in Connemara &ldquo;Tá mé ag dul go dtí an Cnoc&rdquo; they would assume you were going to Cnoc na hAille in Inverin in County Galway. If you said &ldquo;Tá mé ag dul go Cnoc Mhuire&rdquo;, they would presume you were going on a pilgrimage to Knock in County Mayo. Therefore, modern usage associates Cnoc Mhuire with Knock and it is on the basis that I will ask the Commission to give its views again. On the other hand, historical evidence would say they were correct, traditionally, and in the last and previous centuries that An Cnoc, or Knock, was the version in common use by the people but obviously times change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minster of State for this information. The correct traditional usage prior to the apparition would have been An Cnoc. Following the Minister of State's intervention and understanding of modern day usage I might arrange with the administrator, Monsignor Greely, to give him a plenary indulgence because the people will be happy when they hear about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another element of this about which we must be careful. It is important that a body such as An Coimisiún Logainmneacha would provide authorised versions and that we would not change them willy nilly. We have had a major difficulty with local authorities putting up totally incorrect versions of names. It is essential, therefore, to have a standard authorised version. For that reason the proper procedures should be followed. I say that in the context of this case where current usage, especially among Irish speakers, is Cnoc Mhuire, which relates to Knock, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is not to say I would like anybody to think that local authorities can have <i>carte blanche</i> to put up any version of names they want because we have been bedevilled with that happening. The official forms and procedures will not only be maintained but strengthened to ensure <Col N="333" /> there is a common, authorised version of all place names in Irish.</P>

      <P>Nuair a tháinig mé isteach sa Roinn cuireadh ceist orm maidir le tionscnamh a bhain le Ráth Cairn. Chuir mé ar ais ag an Údarás é agus dúirt mé gur cheist don Údarás a bhí ann agus nach raibh mise ag cur laincis ar bith orthu. Tá an cheist pléite agam leis an Údarás ó shin faoi dhó agus tá curtha in iúl dóibh agam, go mór mhór i gcomhthéacs áit go bhfuil, mar shampla, comharchumann ag iarraidh tithíocht agus cóiríocht a chur ar fáil agus go mbeidís sásta déanamh cinnte gur ar mhaithe le Gaeilgeoirí na Gaeltachta a bheadh sé, go mbeadh mé báiúil go dtabharfaí faoin obair sin. Níl ráite ag an Údarás iad féin go bhfuil aon bhac orthu agus is é an chomhairle atá agamsa nach bhfuil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an cheist a thóg an Teachta Sargent, ní fheicim aon bhaint, muna bhainim mí-úsáid as, idir feabhsú infrastructhúir agus díothú na Gaeltachta. Go deimhin féin cuireann sé olc orm nuair a cheapann daoine gur féidir an Ghaeltacht a shábháil trí í a choinneáil i bhfad siar agus iargúlta. Maróidh sé sin an Ghaeltacht chomh scioptha le rud ar bith mar ní bheidh duine ar bith fágtha i gceantar nach féidir fáil isteach nó amach as go héasca. Mar sin tá gá le infrastruchtúr den scoth le go mairfeadh an Ghaeltacht agus go mbeadh slí maireachtála sásúil ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Tá an ceart sin ag pobal na Gaeltachta ach an oiread le pobal ar bith eile sa tír. <Col N="335" /> Ach cuirfidh mé an fainic seo. Níl aon amhras ann i gcomhthéacs na ceiste go ginearálta agus fás eacnamaíochta agus go mór mhór i gcomhthéacs imeall na cathrach i nGaillimh agus an rud atá ag tarlú ar imeall Dhún Gharbháin sa Rinn i bPortláirge, go bhfuil gá déanamh cinnte gur ar mhaithe le Gaeilgeoirí na Gaeltachta agus an dream atá sásta an Ghaeilge a choinneáil á labhairt sa Ghaeltacht atá an t-infrastruchtúr ann.</P>

      <P>The EU Habitats Directive was transposed into national legislation through the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. These regulations provide powers to nominate, designate and protect special areas of conservation, SACs, which are required to be established under the habitats directive.</P>
      <P>The review of An Action Plan for the Millennium commits the Government to implementing the habitats directive in a way that ensures environmental protection is achieved while taking account of landowners' rights. This will be achieved by preventing any activity that is likely to damage the environmental interest of SACs while ensuring that landowners receive full compensation for any income losses arising from the implementation of the directive.</P>
      <P>Payments to farmers for implementing management prescriptions will either be through the rural environmental protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, or through a compensation scheme administered by my Department. Under REPS, a standard payment per hectare is available to farmers, while under my Department's scheme, actual income losses arising will be compensated for. Individual farmers may choose whichever scheme they prefer but, for land uses other than farming, landowners may only avail of my Department's scheme.</P>

      <P>Regarding the general question on the habitats directive, the REPS is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We have our own scheme and there is provision for financial payments under both schemes. The Deputy asked when the directive would be implemented. Negotiations are under way with the European Commission to gain approval for the compensation scheme. When this is complete, arrangements can be made for payment of compensation due. The issue of sites has arisen in the House before. I will outline the philosophy behind our policy on the implementation of the habitats directive. We want to see it fully implemented and the only way to do that is through co-operation. That is why we have proceeded in the manner we have.</P>

      <P>In answering this question I should first clarify that the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street, Dublin, is a constituent part of the National Museum of Ireland. In the Natural History Museum labels are currently bilingual in relation to Irish birds, fish and crustaceans. Elsewhere in the natural history collection the many specimens on display which have no common names in either English or Irish are described using their appropriate scientific title, and the normal convention for this is the Latin name. I am glad to say that the museum is planning to label all specimen mammals in the Natural History Museum in Irish where such names are available. The National Museum of Ireland is committed to pursuing an active bilingual policy throughout its various education programmes.</P>

      <P>This must be seen from a number of angles. One would want to ensure that <Col N="338" /> both Irish and English names are present, where possible. There is also use for the special scientific Latin titles for those who are specialists in this regard. Having all three is obviously the way forward. Most of us would use the ordinary names which can be seen.</P>
      <P>Regarding the outreach programmes and the other educational facilities in our cultural institutions, I wish to recognise that the institutions are placing greater emphasis on the need for outreach and educational programmes so that, as well as bringing people in, the institutions can reach out to the younger members of our community especially.

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a radical review of the arts legislation. It is my considered view that the time is right to have a fundamental examination of the arts Acts which have provided the legislative framework for the development and support of the arts in Ireland since 1951. The arts environment has changed dramatically in the decades since the first arts legislation was enacted in 1951 and, indeed, since the more recent legislation in 1973. The Arts Council's second arts plan, which was adopted by Government this summer, signals a radical change in the council's approach and outlines its intention to become a development agency for the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review I am proposing will embrace these changes and will be undertaken in the broadest possible terms. It will examine the current policy and executive structures and their effectiveness in developing and supporting the arts. It will also look at the effectiveness of the legislation and support structures that have been adopted in other countries. The review will be undertaken in consultation with all the partners involved in the development and support of the arts in Ireland, including the Arts Council itself, local authorities, arts organisations and individual artists as well as <Col N="339" /> the general public. The results of this radical review will inform the development of new legislation for the arts.</P>
    <P>The review process will begin in January. I have established a working group in my Department to work on the processes which need to be put in place from January to fulfil the requirement for a full and radical review of the arts legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that there has been a tremendous change in the attitude towards, and involvement in, the arts over the past ten years. There has been an explosion of interest in the arts and we must examine our current structures and legislation to see how we can best approach the commitment which exists. We must consider how we can deliver the best possible service in terms of the supports needed.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council made a very direct statement in its second arts plan in regard to its intention to become a developmental agency for the arts. It now identifies a different emphasis to that which existed when the council was set up in 1951. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the council&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask the review group to focus on a difficulty which has arisen in my own constituency? The Arts Council has not been able to make any financial contribution to the Waterford Festival of Light Opera which the Minister will agree is a very important event. The reason given is that, since the festival is a competition, it cannot be funded by the Arts Council. Although I understand where that thinking comes from, the Waterford festival and other important events throughout the country should not be excluded from funding for that reason.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> I appreciate the points raised by the Deputy. The Arts Council is a very important body in the delivery of support to the arts sector but it is only one element of the review of the arts Acts.

Members of this House are politically castrated because they cannot ask questions about the National Gallery, National Museum or the Arts Council. While I respect the independence of these organisations, does the Minister agree that they should be answerable for their actions to the Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language?

As I outlined then, the services of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London were engaged by the Minister for Education and Science and myself to undertake a study,<i> inter alia</i>, on the scope, content and the process to be adopted to achieve the preferred model for such an academy. The actual terms of reference given to the Guildhall were to recommend on the appropriate scope and content for the proposed academy for the performing arts in Ireland; the areas of immediate and long-term specialisation appropriate to the academy; the process to be adopted to achieve the preferred model and the potential, if any, for rationalisation of existing courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Guildhall presented its comprehensive report during the summer. The thinking of my colleague, the Minister of Education and Science, and myself has been considerably informed by this report. Our thinking is now at an advanced <Col N="342" /> stage and we expect to be in a position to bring our proposals to Government in the near future.</P>

We are waiting for observations to come back from other Departments, as is usual, and we will then bring our memorandum to Government. It will not be too long.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the promotion of Irish culture abroad is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, through the cultural relations committee of his Department. However, it may be noted that my Department provides funding to certain organisations, including the Arts Council and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, which, in turn, contribute in various ways to the development of cultural and linguistic links abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific regard to the Irish language, my Department is participating in a tripartite project, Iomairt Cholm Cille, which also involves Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is aimed at improving relations between Irish speakers in Ireland and Gaidhlic speakers in Scotland and developing cultural links between the three areas based on a <Col N="343" /> common shared heritage. My Department also provides assistance to an Irish language initiative in Britain and to one on the continent.             </P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. An issue on which I ask him to expound is the fact there seems to be some conflict or tension in relation to cultural tourism and what some people see as a cheapening of it by putting it into a &ldquo;stage Irishman&rdquo; mould. Does the Minister believe that is a serious problem in terms of the establishment of cultural links with people in other countries?</P>

      <P>On visits to the US in the past year, particularly to Milwaukee where the summerfest took place, one of the things which struck me was the growing interest in every aspect of Irish culture, particularly seannós, traditional Irish dancing, seannós dancing and the Irish language. Contrary to popular opinion, there is now a growing interest worldwide in every aspect of Irish culture, particularly those aspects which would not normally be considered popular.</P>
      <P>We will have to look at how this interest can be cultivated, particularly in terms of the Gaeltacht. I have argued for a long time that its role in tourism should serve those niche markets to which they have a product to sell as no other part of the country has a comparable product to sell. There have been developments in that regard in places like Gleann Colum Cille, Áras uí Cadhain and so on, which attract high quality tourism. There is a potential which we should develop.</P>

      <P>That would fall within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs but I will speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this issue because there is an untapped interest worldwide which should be developed and which has an economic spin-off.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a proposal in the programme for Government to establish an international agency for the advancement for culture abroad. The old argument about this was that cultural relations was dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs with a limited budget and there was not an international agency to build on l'Ima<Col N="344" /> ginaire Irlandais in France or the Frankfurt book fair, for example. How stands that proposal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

That is the way forward. Whether we need another agency to do this or whether existing agencies and structures can handle it is a good question. I am not one who believes we should set up more agencies willy-nilly but would like us to use existing agencies and voluntary bodies to see how we can further promote Irish culture worldwide.</P>

      <P>On the question of section 481 and the reference the Deputy made to it being extended for another year, the reason it was given an extra year &ndash; the Deputy will know it was due to expire in 1999 &ndash; was that this review was being undertaken. Now that we have this information I will go to Government with it. The Deputy will be delighted to hear also that the Film Board will be able to report tremendous progress in the indigenous film sector, as many people are seeking assistance in this area. That is very important. If we are to have a strengthened film industry we must see the growth of our indigenous film industry, which is growing apace.</P>

Can the Minister comment on the report on film training needs towards the year 2000 that was commissioned by STATCOM and that identified skill gaps between the time of the revitalisation of the film industry and the year 2000. Can the Minister indicate whether she is satisfied there has been sufficient progress in this regard?</P>

      <P>To take the last question first, I would encourage counties to set up their own film commissions. Kerry was the last county to do so and Deputy Deenihan kindly asked me down to the opening, which was a day of great celebration. It is most important that local authorities take an interest in the film industry, as that is the way forward. That is why I felt there was a need to set up a national film commission. We promised that when in Opposition and we have already delivered on it.</P>
      <P>Regarding film training and skills, the Deputy will be aware that the strategic group referred in its report to every element of the film industry, not least the training and education areas. That group put forward approximately 20 recommendations and my proposals to Government will be substantially based on those recommendations. The training area will be incorporated in any proposals I put to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 13 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The estimate of £18.5 million for the year 2000 provided for the national parks and wildlife service, subhead S of my Department's Vote, must be considered in the context of the allocation made for the same subhead in 1999. The 1999 allocation of £23.239 million represented an increase of 98% over the estimated outturn for 1998. This increase was based on the estimated compensation costs arising from the implementation of the habitats directive in Ireland. However the estimated outturn for 1999 is now expected to be in the order of £18.3 million.</P>
      <P>The reduction over 1999 in the estimate for subhead S for the year 2000 reflects the best estimate of the compensation costs arising from the implementation of the Habitats Directive. Compensation is payable to landowners where restrictions arising from the designation of special areas of conservation, SACs, result in a loss of income to the landowner. Farmers can obtain compensation either by joining the rural environment protection scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or by claiming directly from my Department for actual losses arising. Compensation costs are particularly difficult to estimate as restrictions on lands and actual losses can vary from landholding to landholding and there can be a significant time lag between agreement on compensation schemes and maximum take up under those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister set up an independent arbitration board under former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills. How many cases are outstanding and are yet to be determined by that body? Is that what the estimated compensation relates to &ndash; outstanding payments?</P>
      <P>Regarding the national parks and wildlife service, how is it proposed that trained park and wildlife rangers will suddenly become archaeological wardens when they are not trained for such work? I understand the Minister wants these park rangers to do archaeological work in monitoring archaeological sites. How is it proposed they do that when they have no training in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Both questions asked do not pertain to the original question and if the Deputy wants the information, particularly regarding figures, he should put down the relevant question in order to get an accurate answer. Regarding the habitats directive, the reason money is being put aside in subhead S is that it is estimated for the year 2000 and it reflects the best estimate for the <Col N="348" /> compensation costs of the implementation of the directive. That is why this money has been put aside in that Vote. I am committed to fair and equitable compensation provisions and all due compensation costs will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is really about the loss of funding for farmers who really need it: those farmers with special areas of conservation. Is the Minister standing over a further reduction in funds for farmers who will require this compensation in the year 2000? There is a huge reduction in the amount of money available and despite the Minister using the warm words, &ldquo;the best estimate&rdquo;, it does not seem that her Department will provide the proper funding to those who require compensation when their lands are designated as special areas of conservation. The Minister built up aggravation about these areas when she was in Opposition and she must go some way to meet these people's demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused by the Deputy's contribution. He is trying to scaremonger about this matter, but any compensation costs that meet the criteria of either REPS or my Department's scheme will be met. As regards his filibustering on the habitats directive, the Deputy will remember it was discussed in the House long before this Government came to power. On our accession to Government, this Department and the Minister of State and myself took what we believe to be a fair and equitable approach in giving landowners and land users their say through the appeals board and liaison committees. This was a way of factoring in local involvement which was not there heretofore.</P>

      <P>The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, from which the establishment of Comhairle arises, is designed to empower and enable people with disabilities to achieve and exercise their economic, social, political and civil rights. This must be welcomed. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities concluded that public attitudes toward disability are still based on charity rather than on rights and the odds are stacked against people with disabilities at almost every turn. Whether their status is looked at in terms of economics, information, education, mobility or housing, they are treated <Col N="350" /> in certain cases as second class citizens. They want and are entitled to equality and full participation as citizens.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that knowledge is power and that for people with disabilities access to information is critical to their equality and full participation as citizens. It is important that the primary function of Comhairle, as set out in the Bill, is that of an information provider especially targeted at providing clear, accurate and comprehensive advice to people with disabilities. The philosophy of the Centre for Independent Living is that it is the right of all persons, regardless of age, type or extent of disability, to live in the community as opposed to living in an institution; to have the same rights and choices available to everyone else in relation to housing, transportation, education and employment; to be able to participate in the social, economic and political life of their communities with all the duties and privileges this entails and to unfold their potential.</P>
      <P>When the Minister visited Sligo he published a newsletter on the old age pension, which is commendable. The Minister has done a great deal in increasing awareness since he entered office. There was a good reaction to that newsletter. A similar publication in an easy to read form for people with disabilities, outlining their entitlements and the services available to them would be of considerable benefit. So many associations and groups provide services for the disabled and a simple booklet outlining who they could contact in different regions as regards their entitlements would be an excellent idea. Perhaps the Minister will consider that. I must give credit to the commitment of the staff at the social welfare office in Sligo and the pensions section. The services are very much customer-based. The senior citizens in Sligo appreciated the effort put into the newsletter. People like to feel they can access information without any constraints.</P>
      <P>Accessing information can be difficult at the best of times, never mind in a time of crisis. People suddenly find themselves in the role of carers following an accident or sudden illness and may be unsure of the help and support to which they are entitled. A once-off publication in this regard would be of tremendous benefit. Independent advice will be provided by this new agency. The Minister also visited the citizens' information centre in Sligo on another occasion. We are lucky to have an excellent centre in Sligo. I send a great number of my constituents to the centre where the staff are highly professional and reassuring. It provides a wonderful service. The staff have the expertise to comprehensively deal with queries which is important. Hopefully this Bill will empower people with disabilities and give them the same access and professional approach which is so necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 1,000 disabled people are trained annually but cannot get jobs. The Minister should look at this. The Employment Equality Act will come into force soon and the local authorities are meet<Col N="351" /> ing the 3% quota. However, despite this, last year 938 people with disabilities did not proceed into any further training or employment; a similar outcome is expected this year. This is a major task for the Department. There is a huge number of job vacancies, particularly in the services sector. There should be an incentive to encourage employers to take on disabled people. They could be placed in supermarkets, hotels or restaurants. They could be matched with jobs and tax breaks should be given to employers . I do not suggest there should be preferential treatment, but it is disappointing for people who have undergone training when they cannot find a job. I ask the Minister to examine this area.</P>
    <P>The NRB will disappear under the new arrangements but the Minister must be careful when it comes to the division of people into categories. Some areas will be dealt with by FÁS and there is a need to avoid a conflict of interest. FÁS has done fantastic work in the training area. It is recognised as a wonderful training organisation. In the formation of the new board, it is important that there is a clear distinction regarding its role.</P>
    <P>The role of carers in communities is most important. There is plenty of money in the new £40 billion national plan for roads, railways, sewerage systems and housing but we must not forget the people who most need help at this time. They are the most vulnerable people in society. Funds have been targeted at this area, but there is a need for additional funding and benefits particularly as we approach the new millennium.</P>
    <P>We must remember that 1,273 people urgently require personal assistance services. This issue is most important. There is a huge demand for resource centres and residential respite care. A total of 3,500 people are in urgent need of a break. We must not forget that the people who care for family members and friends also need help.</P>
    <P>I received a letter today from the resource centre in Carton village in Sligo which states that unless it gets new funding in the new year, its existence is threatened. Its existing funding from Area Development Management Limited and the Combat Poverty Agency through the EU special support programme for peace and reconciliation finishes in June next year. Its current FÁS community employment scheme also finishes in June next year. The letter asks if I am aware of the proposed cutbacks in community employment schemes. It states that if it does not get a roll over regarding the FÁS scheme and the peace and reconciliation funding, it will find itself with little staff or resources to run the centre from June next year.</P>
    <P>FÁS does an enormous amount of work and the certainty of having people to work on projects under these schemes provides reassurance to organisations. There is much concern regarding the establishment of new schemes after old ones <Col N="352" /> finish because organisations can only re-employ 10% of existing FÁS staff. For example, if there are 20 FÁS staff, only two can be re-engaged. It would be beneficial to organisations if the number which could be re-employed were higher. This problem affects resource centres and associations dealing with disabled people. For example, the Irish Wheelchair Association needs staff but only 10% can be reinstated annually. This places huge pressure on the organisation for the first few months while new recruits are trained to a level of competency where they can provide adequate care.</P>
    <P>The Minister is holding a national information day on 29 November, the theme of which is building a future together. It will discuss the commitment at national and European levels to enhancing the position of people with disabilities. It will also provide a forum to discuss issues of concern to people with disabilities and review progress and initiatives taken during the year regarding disability equality. It is important in the deliberations not to forget that 360,000 people have disabilities and special needs arising from them &ndash; this includes people with disabilities, carers, parents and organisations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a statutory authority involving the merger of the National Social Services Board and the transfer of certain functions of the NRB. It is important that the authority provides readily accessible information to people with disabilities so that they are aware of their entitlements. It is important that people are fully involved in policy and decision making on every issue that affects them. The right of self-determination of people with disabilities is important and there is a need to promote disability awareness in the wider community, to fight for equity for all citizens nationally and locally in the employment, training and education areas and to ensure justice and equality for all people with disabilities. This is a crucial area which must not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The strategy for equality was drawn up by people with disabilities and includes 402 recommendations. It is important to take on board the core objectives which would benefit so many people who need help. The Bill covers the definition and role of the philosophy of independent living and carers. Many of them were present in the gallery for last night's debate and they feel they are being left behind. We must change that, particularly as the economy is doing so well and there is a new £40 billion national development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 7 states that the new board will promote greater accessibility, co-ordination and public awareness of social services and of information and advice services provided by statutory and voluntary bodies. This is most important. Regarding accessibility, the new centres will not be physically close to all centres of population and will not serve all remote rural areas. It is important that people in remote areas are fully aware of benefits. It is essential that the new body works <Col N="353" /> in close co-operation with the voluntary bodies to ensure that it has an active role in the provision of information.</P>
    <P>Voluntary agencies providing services to people with disabilities come into daily or weekly contact with many people who require advice or assistance either for themselves or family members. It is essential that the body ensures the voluntary agencies are provided with targeted, focused information packs that are tailored to meet the client base of each voluntary agency regardless of whether they deal with physical, sensory or intellectual disabilities or people with dementia or mental illness. It is a huge task and I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best to improve the situation. Given the wealth of information, it is most important that a simple publication is available which would provide easily accessible information. The Minister circulated an information booklet on entitlements for the elderly. A similar booklet could be provided to every person in receipt of disability allowance outlining contact points and their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Disability affects every community and it is a huge problem. In Sligo many groups are fighting the causes of people with disabilities. The allocation of funding for the provision of more public health nurses throughout the county would relieve the pressure on geriatric hospitals and nursing homes. Carers are not adequately paid for the work they do. In some instances they are paid as little as £2 per hour, even though the minimum wage is now £4 per hour. If there was a proper wage structure for carers the service would greatly improve. The Government should increase the allowance for personal care assistants where people need care on a 24 hour basis. This would relieve the increasing demands on health boards to provide hospital care for these people. For a relatively small amount of money people in need could be looked after in their own communities. Carers should get some form of recognition by way of an increase in their allowance. Funding should be made available for the home help service whereby lunch could be provided for old people living alone or those with disabilities who cannot cook a lunch themselves. The Bill does not deal with this issue. There must be greater awareness of the needs of people with disabilities. From speaking with the Minister, I am aware he has a clear understanding of the needs of people with disabilities. His Department has a huge budget and he could make a difference as Minister by indicating at Cabinet where funds should be targeted to get the best value for money.</P>
    <P>Attention must be paid to this issue. At a time when the economy is booming, we must fight for the cause of those less well off than ourselves, people who feel marginalised and left behind. Given the Government's present budget, much can be done in this area. The Government should be a caring Government and live up to its responsibility to those who need personal assisance and care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief because the main features of the Bill have been adequately discussed. There have been generous contributions from all sides of the House in acknowledging that the Minister has shown he has a particular interest in making progress in this area. This might be a slight Bill, nevertheless it is extremely important. At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the work done over the years by the National Social Service Board. The NSSB has provided valuable information in areas where other agencies have failed. I look forward to the NSSB and the NRB, in their new framework, making real progress in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's aims in this legislation. There is a fundamental problem with all bureaucratic agencies, irrespective of how well intentioned they may be, whether in the public or private sector. Over time, public and private sector bureaucracies become more focused on the institutional needs of the agencies themselves rather than on the needs of their client base. This happens in all sectors. It does not happen because there is a conspiracy to deny clients information or service, it is an inevitable by-product of bureaucratic structures. Where the client base suffers a particular challenge or disability, the problems of bureaucracy become even more pressing. Those of us who have served on health boards can bear witness to that.</P>
      <P>Another problem in the public sector is that of institutional fragmentation. There is confusion among organisations, frequently well meaning organisations, which have territorial remits that sometimes overlap and cause confusion to the client. Another problem in the public sector frequently arises in relation to information, notwithstanding the fact that the Freedom of Information Act has been in operation for some years. I have some criticisms of that Act. Customers of many public service agencies are often badly served in relation to information. Real efforts have been made to improve this service. Deputy Perry paid generous tribute to the welcome initiative of the Minister and his Department on the pensioners booklet. That is an exemplary example of what should be done by public service agencies. I take this opportunity to put on record my personal appreciation of what the Minister and his officials have done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is addressing the three issues of confusion, client orientation and the information service. The aims and objectives of the Bill do not deserve the rather precious debate during part of the contributions today on the issue of its title. It seems it matters not what an agency is called as long as it is structured in a way that will give it a clear focus. One of the things this Bill does is it produces a very clear focus. I draw Deputy Durkan's attention to the clarity in section 7 which in many ways is a model for legislation. It provides this new agency with an effective mission statement. It has a great deal to commend it. The section focuses the Comhairle on two significant areas, information and advocacy. <Col N="355" /> As Deputy Durkan knows &ndash; I had the pleasure of serving in his company for many years on the health board &ndash; information&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a mutual pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and advocacy are of critical importance. These are particularly important to people with disabilities and to their families and carers. It is sometimes virtually impossible to obtain information as to the extent of rights because they are spread across a number of agencies and it is difficult to get someone to advocate the case. The provisions in the section as to the nature of the agency, its intent and focus are very welcome.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to the manner in which this same section deals with the issue of information. I chair the SMI committee and I do not believe that committee or the SMI section could write a better remit for an information provider. It provides that the information must be accurate, comprehensive and clear. If these three objectives are achieved, it will mean a remarkable change in the affairs of the State. It is important also that the information is relevant and focused. All too frequently official communications fall short on all three counts. In far too many agencies the information provided to their client base is inadequate. Far too many public service agencies guard information about their services as jealously as one would guard the last remaining copy of the formula for eternal youth. They forget that they are there to provide a service to the public. Information supplied by public service agencies, even with the improvements in recent years, is all too frequently couched in bureaucratic terms and confused by jargon. This makes it virtually incomprehensible, therefore the information is not information, it is simply frustration. I pay tribute to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and his immediate predecessors for the striking improvements that have taken place in that Department.</P>
      <P>Information for people with disability poses additional challenges, first, because there are so many different public sector agencies involved, second, because of the individual needs of the client and, third, because all too frequently people who find themselves with a disability are disadvantaged in a number of other areas. It is important, therefore, to make a special effort to improve information in this regard. This agency has a clear remit in regard to information. I welcome that remarkably progressive step. Notwithstanding quibbles which we might have on points of detail on all sides of the House, I think that would be genuinely and honestly recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make a brief reference to the advocacy role. The advocacy role which is outlined for this new agency is very important. All too frequently at present the advocacy role is either left to voluntary organisations, which are frequently poorly funded, or to public representa<Col N="356" /> tives who have a myriad of other issues with which to deal. By specifying this role of Comhairle the Minister is adding an additional resourced focused advocacy agency for people with a disability. That is a welcome and worthwhile improvement and I compliment the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the strategic review is a significant and important provision. Section 8 effectively puts the strategic review of services in this area on a statutory basis. I certainly welcome that as would most Members of the House. Many public services start off well, continue into decline and then rumble on into the far distant background. They seem to lose their focus. It is difficult for a public service agency, bogged down as it inevitably will be with day to day detail, to actual abstract itself sufficiently from the pressure of that detail to perform the strategic review function. This is a critically important role which the Minister has given and I compliment him on isolating this function and specifying in law that we will have an agency which will have responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>There are, as Deputy Perry pointed out by quoting various statistics, a third of a million people in the State with disabilities and special needs arising from them. When one is talking about people with disabilities, one is talking about a huge community, not just about the people themselves, their immediate families and their carers but about all of those who surround them. In a State which is making progress on the economic front, ultimately we will be valued by the amount of resources, time, effort and organisation we put into servicing the needs of people who are less fortunate than others. This is progressive legislation. I compliment the Minister on it. I commend the Bill and I hope other Members will do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that a Department, for which I had some small responsibility in the past, is still alive and well, doing its job and pushing out the boat with new horizons in mind. However, I am not so sure that it has not slipped and fallen by the wayside in one respect because I have inquired of a number of people and I have had various explanations of the name of the structure. I tried to figure out from where the name came. I have heard a number of explanations and I have come to the conclusion that perhaps the Office of the Ceann Comhairle may be an inspiration for the name and they just left out the first word. That would be complimentary. I wondered would the name have originated from comhairle ceantar. That would be a serious development and I would be a little worried about the machinations it might get into in the future. It is Comhairle, as in adviser or <i>consiliero</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, the question of imparting information is important &ndash; other speakers have referred to that &ndash; and Comhairle has a vital role to play in ensuring that the public, that is people with disabilities and able bodied people, have <Col N="357" /> some idea of their rights and entitlements. However, it does not bestow rights or entitlements on these people. For example, can it be said that people with a disability have an entitlement to easy access to public transport? The Bill, I am sorry to say, will do nothing for such people.</P>
    <P>In recent times a great deal of time and energy has rightly been spent on the needs and requirements of people with disabilities. Last night there was a debate on carers who provide an essential service to people with disabilities. We can have all the reports, discussions and quangos in the world but if there is no means of delivering the entitlement to the person concerned, then it is all for nothing. A number of questions emanate from any discussion on a Bill of this nature, the first of which is the one to which I have just referred, that is, the entitlement of people with disabilities to access trains and buses in the public transport service. Can anybody in this House answer this question? It is relatively easy because public transport is very restricted. In fact these people enjoy virtually no access, or very limited access, to public transport. How widespread is the availability of access to public and private buildings for people with disabilities? Can a person confined to a wheelchair travel around this city, use public and private transport and gain access to all public buildings? The answer is no. Therefore, while on the one hand we are imparting the information and telling them what they should be entitled to, we are not providing them or others with the wherewithal to provide these entitlements.</P>
    <P>I again emphasise the importance of information, but the imparting of the information only gives the individual some indication of how little access they have to what they are entitled. That opens up a new vista. Information is supposed to mean empowerment and, to some extent, it does mean that. It empowers the person to look for what they are entitled.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of housing for the disadvantaged, people with disabilities and others, approximately 10% of the people who require housing can have their needs met. Therefore, people will be told to what they are entitled due to their circumstances but they must refer to another agency, body or quango to find out to what extent their entitlement will be curtailed by virtue of the limited availability of supply. That is a critical aspect of the provision of services for anybody. The other 90% are given information about their entitlement but told that there are limitations on the extent to which we can provide the service at present. That is a worrying aspect. It tends to engender in people's minds a contempt for the political system because people are not so foolish as to go on believing in something if they feel disappointed by what is laid before them. The disappointment in these cases is as I have outlined it. There is the theory that the information is being made available to people first so that they will know their entitlements and then further information is made available by some<Col N="358" /> body else which immediately makes them aware of the limitation of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>This needs to be looked at carefully, particularly when dealing with people with disabilities. Such people have special needs and concerns and they have special worries at all times, some of which relate to their future. It would be dangerous to trifle with those concerns and fears, particularly when it comes to what we tell them. I needed go over the contents of last night's debate, of which the Minister will be aware. He understands the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey, as he was leaving the House, was heard muttering, &ldquo;Another quango&rdquo; and, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you and I know what quango has come to mean over the years in this House. The late Deputy Brian Lenihan regularly referred to how quangos did or did not work and how they were never accountable. That was Deputy Lenihan's major quibble with such agencies which are still a problem because they fall outside the remit of the House and are not accountable to it. Evidence of this can be seen by the daily disallowance of parliamentary questions because &ldquo;the Minister has official responsibility to the House&rdquo; in respect of the matter raised. The Minister is accountable to the House for every penny of his Department's Vote, not to quangos or agencies which produce glossy annual reports.</P>
    <P>People used to say that a camel was a horse designed by a committee. If that is the case, a quango is a committee designed by a horse or a camel. In so far as accountability is concerned, there is something defective in terms of the way these agencies operate. When quangos are being established in the future, great consideration should be given to the manner and methodology whereby they and the Minister are made responsible to the House. Unless that is done, the House will become completely irrelevant. We will be faced with a situation where Ministers will go outside the House to do their business. It has been suggested that this is already happening because most announcements are made outside the House and Members only receive the relevant information secondhand. If that is the way people wish to operate, that is fine. However, that is not the way a Parliament should operate. Someone must answer for every penny voted by the national Parliament to each Department. The ultimate responsibility in such circumstances must be to the House or further problems will arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us may achieve one thing in that it regulates, on a statutory basis, the provision of particular services to a specific group of people. The provision of information to these people will hopefully be of benefit to them but it may also be of benefit to the wider community. There used to be a suggestion that people with disabilities are a burden on society, but the position is quite the reverse. These people represent a possible economic benefit to society, provided they are given the wherewithal to realise their potential. If they are not allowed to do so, they will obviously become a burden.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> It is important to recognise that when we lay down provisions in law, these should mean something to the people for whom they are intended. If it should transpire that the people at whom the information is targeted become disappointed with the manner in which it is delivered, with its impact or its meaning, serious problems will arise for those who produce the information. If such information does not deliver what it purports to deliver, the entire system will fail. The concept is not a bad one but, unless there is an agreed programme to provide for the needs identified, it will fail. It is like saying to someone, &ldquo;You would be entitled to X, Y or Z if we had A, B or C in place&rdquo;. Putting proper systems in place is the key to solving problems in this area in the future.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider access to hospitals and equality of access to hospital services for people with disabilities or the elderly. People who qualify for free travel have no difficulty travelling to their local hospital but they must make their journey at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. when it is not technically possible for the free travel system to operate. They qualify for free travel and they can use the service, but not when they wish to do so. I cannot understand the reasoning behind this. It would be much more logical for hospitals to ensure that these people are brought in at a later stage of the day. This would avoid their disrupting hospital services, on one hand, or disrupting their own lives by being obliged to sit in a waiting area from 8 a.m. or earlier. That is a typically classic example of the way the system works.</P>
    <P>I hope the members of Comhairle will realise that there is no point putting on paper something that means nothing to the people for whom it was intended.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who made constructive contributions to the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputies Durkan and Perry referred to the word &ldquo;quango&rdquo; and I know they were not in any way suggesting that the NSSB or the NRB were quangos. I guarantee Members that Comhairle is not another quango, it is an amalgamation of two excellent organisations. Most people accept that this is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>A number of Members referred to the Title of the Bill and the name of the new board. The Title was chosen because we wanted to emphasise the issues of advice and advocacy. We could have chosen a longer one but we did not do so. As a number of Members stated, many people, particularly those outside the House, would not know that the NSSB was responsible for publishing the excellent publication, Relate. To a certain extent, therefore, we wanted to make the new board synonymous with information relating to social services. The Title was chosen from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Deputy Perry and others referred to the excellent advice and information booklet issued to 311,000 old age pensioners in the past two weeks <Col N="360" /> which deals with issues relating to social welfare, medical card entitlement and taxation issues relevant to old age pensioners. Since the booklet was issued, I have heard nothing but good comments about it. If my Department spends any money in the future, it will not be as well spent as that invested in the production of that publication. The reaction from Deputies on all sides bears that out.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Perry's request that we consider issuing such a booklet on disability benefit, such a publication, which relates to people with disabilities and carers, is already in train. It is hoped to issue this next year.</P>
    <P>A number of Members inquired about the new initiatives to be undertaken by Comhairle. In the near future I will be going to Cork to launch a new free telephone information service on a pilot basis. The database within the NSSB, which will become Comhairle, will also be available on the Internet very soon.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked what the advocacy services entail &ndash; Deputy O'Keeffe asked if it would include legal representation. It does not. There is no overlap with a body such as the Legal Aid Board or private legal representation. The Comhairle representatives would assist social welfare claimants about how to go about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan asked about the vision of the Department in this area. The document sets out in detail what we require in relation to a strategic plan. That is the way we want to move. Some speakers suggested this because it is better for those people directly involved in this area to come forward with their views as to how they see the future. The strategic plan will be laid before me and, based on that, the necessary funding will be made available to the new body.</P>
    <P>The NSSB has been an excellent advisory organisation. In 1997 the funding amounted to £2.97 million. There was a 14% increase in the 1998 budget bringing that figure up to £3.38 million. In 1999 there was a 30% increase, bringing it to £4.37 million. The reason for those increases was that I, as Minister, believed that the NSSB was on the right track &ndash; it was extending its information database. Ultimately that will be available on the Internet and will be the linchpin of the organisation throughout the State, particularly in the CICs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan asked about consultation. There was a great deal of consultation. The staff was consulted constantly and it was on the agenda of the establishment group. Staff from both the NSSB and the NRB were also represented in the working groups. A staff information day was held in October. The Deputy also raised the issue of a worker representative. There is such a representative, no different to the NSSB over the years and I was not going to change that. There should be a staff representative on the board of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Physical access to the buildings is an issue for the service providers and is covered by the guidelines for public bodies making themselves wheel<Col N="361" /> chair friendly. Most of the 35 full-time CICs are compliant with access guidelines, although smaller offices have a mixed level of compliance. The new buildings which will be taken on board by the new body are generally compliant but this is an area which will be enhanced with the increased funding made available to the new organisation.</P>
    <P>Some speakers veered off the subject; issues related to pharmacists were even mentioned. Time does not allow me to respond to those issues but I thank all for their contributions and look forward to the establishment of the new body.</P>

      <P>The Dundrum bypass has been an objective of the county council for almost 30 years but remained unbuilt because successive Governments refused to fund it. It was only when the Southern Cross motorway became imminent the Department agreed to provide partial funding. During those years traffic conditions deteriorated, the cost of construction escalated and is now a high multiple of the original estimate. The disruption costs of construction are almost inestimable in an area of Dublin which is densely populated, with high car ownership, appalling public transport and even the main radial route is of a width and standard more suitable to the horse and cart than to the vast volumes of cars and heavy goods vehicles which use it every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nightmare has now come to pass where the Southern Cross motorway will arrive at the top of Dundrum in 16 months. The only way for cars and trucks to access it will be by through the village itself or from the even narrower Sandyford Road. This area is already a permanent traffic jam. When the motorway opens and acts as a magnet to further traffic, there will be mayhem, not only on the motorway but across a swathe of south County Dublin, radiating out from Dundrum. The industrial estate on the Sandyford Road will be virtually inaccessible. I have no idea how <Col N="362" /> the 12,000 people employed there will get to and from work.</P>
    <P>This will be a national scandal of monumental proportions which will be featured in the media on a daily basis. This is an indictment of the public service and its ability to plan and deliver. It will give credence to those who criticise the public service at national and local levels and such criticism will be totally justified.</P>
    <P>The sad thing is that this scenario was well signalled. The bypass was designed well in advance and could have been built four years ago had funding been available and avoided the construction disruption of building a motorway at the same time. Instead, the Department or the Minister decided that funding was to come from a private developer through whose land the bypass will run. Inevitably that development ended up with An Bord Pleanála, remained there for six months and was finally rejected.</P>
    <P>A project of this magnitude and importance to the national road network should never have been made contingent on something as uncertain as a decision of An Bord Pleanála. It is now too late, even if the Minister was to hand me a cheque this evening, to have this vital approach road to the motorway in place in time for the arrival of the motorway itself. I am asking that the funding be made available immediately to minimise that period of mayhem so that it will be for months rather than years that people will suffer this disruption.</P>
    <P>It would be unconscionable to make planning again dependent on the vagaries of a lengthy planning application, the outcome of which is uncertain. There are lessons to be learned from this example of how not to do public business, lessons which must be learned if there is to be any hope of achieving the targets set out in the national development plan or of achieving the Minister's own house building targets. Increasingly local authorities are dependent on private developer funding for water, sewerage and road projects. This works fine until any one of those private developers falls foul of the planning process. Then the development of the entire area comes to a standstill. I can point to examples where this is happening again and again.</P>
    <P>This way of doing business might make sense if there was no money in the Exchequer but there is and it must be put into the development of our infrastructure if any progress is to made. I am not suggesting that the private sector should not contribute to infrastructure, particularly that which facilitates development, but it could be recouped later. A project like the Dundrum bypass should not be made dependent on a private planning application.</P>
    <P>It is too late to avoid the public opprobrium which will be heaped on the Minister's head for this disastrous management of public business. Something could, however, be rescued if the funding was provided to commence construction even at this late stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, approved the Dundrum Main Street bypass and the Wyckham bypass-Ballinteer Road improvement scheme on environmental grounds on 22 September 1998. The new road scheme will provide a feeder route to the M5 and will act as a relief route for the Dundrum area, reducing traffic congestion in Dundrum Main Street and in adjacent residential areas. It will, accordingly, have a major impact in facilitating the free flow of traffic in the area and reducing travel time for road users. It will also provide improved facilities for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
      <P>The scheme consists of three main elements: the Ballinteer road improvement, a realignment of Ballinteer Road, generally to the east of the existing road, the Wyckham bypass and the Dundrum Main Street bypass.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has indicated that the Southern Cross Route to Ballinteer interchange and the Ballinteer Road improvement-Wyckham bypass are scheduled for completion by April-May 2001, the 18 month contract having commenced in October 1999. Funding for the Ballinteer Road-Wyckham bypass scheme is being provided by the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to Dundrum Main Street bypass is that the council expect to commence construction of the Dundrum bypass in late summer 2000 and to complete the scheme 15 months later, that is, by end 2001. It is estimated that this project will cost about £21.5 million comprising land costs of £16 million and construction-design costs of £5.5 million. The council and the developers have in their ownership lands necessary for the scheme to the value of £2.5 million and £7.5 million respectively and it was intended that the developers would fund the cost of constructing the section of road which would be on their land. This section represents approximately one fifth of the scheme and would cost in the region of £1 million. This left a balance of £10.5 million and the Department of the Environment and Local Government informed Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on 28 July 1999 that it had been decided to commit funding in this amount for the scheme. It was emphasised that the Department's grant commitment would not exceed this figure and that any expenditure in excess of this amount would have to be borne by the council from its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at its meeting on 1 November 1999, noted that the Department had committed funding of £10.5 million and decided, in view of An Bord Pleanála's decision on the planning permission application <Col N="364" /> from the developers, to look at other sources of funding, including levies on developers or provision of land at no cost by developers.</P>
    <P>The council states that its consultants are pressing ahead with the preparation of the contract documents by the bypass scheme and it is likely that construction works will commence in late summer 2000. In the meantime, it is expected that the developers will lodge a fresh planning application.</P>
    <P>I trust this information is of assistance to the Deputy. It shows the Government's commitment to ensuring new arterial routes and major rural improvements are made everywhere possible throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister for taking this important matter on the Adjournment. The core problem that has been created in regard to the rent subsidy scheme is the huge demand for rented accommodation throughout the country, especially in the greater Dublin catchment area. This demand has resulted in the cost of accommodation rising dramatically, thus creating a situation where the guidelines and limits operated by the health boards match the bottom of the scale for accommodation standards only. This accommodation, some of which has been brought to my attention, is unacceptable for families to move into and does not lend itself to creating an atmosphere for family life. I could give many examples of such accommodation but there is no need as most public representatives are well aware of what I speak about. I have no doubt they have made representations to the relevant health boards in regard to same.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister increase funding to health boards to allow them readjust the guidelines and limits. It is imperative that local authorities and health boards co-operate to ensure that rented accommodation meets the statutory laws laid down in relation to same.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow single parents, single persons or married couples and their families to be housed in such substandard houses or apartments. All these unfortunate families are in receipt of social welfare payments and if the present trend is allowed to continue it will be evident to these families that we are not a caring society. We must ensure they have decent accommodation. This is possible if the combined efforts of the local authorities and the health boards tackle the problem. Both should examine the accommodation before the applicant takes possession and should it be necessary to carry out repairs, the owners of the property should be informed. Electrical problems, where they exist, should be addressed immediately as they are obvious fire hazards. Bathing facilities should also be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has to be addressed in the short term. We cannot continue in this time of full and plenty to permit families to live in squalor. We <Col N="365" /> must use all our legislation and officials to rectify this problem. Given that the solution is within the remit of the Minister's Department I ask that he address same as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set by the health board using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>The average weekly rent supplement payment differs in each health board as the rents charged for accommodation vary across each health board, reflecting market forces and local conditions. For example, the limits set in all health board areas take into account information received from local auctioneers and letting agents regarding average rents charged in the area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of the annual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. Health boards must satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of the experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement. My Department has no role in that aspect.</P>
      <P>The current rent levels for the Eastern Health Board area, which includes County Kildare, have applied with effect from 1 January 1999 and are shown in the following tabular statement. The Eastern Health Board has recently reviewed its rent levels and proposes to increase the levels with effect from 1 January 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health board has discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation. The report of an interdepartmental committee on housing was published in August 1999 and the Government has decided in principle to implement its main recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that a new rent assistance scheme be put in place, operated by the local authorities, to serve people who have long-term housing needs, including those who currently rely on SWA rent supplements on a long-term basis. Income support elements of the SWA scheme, including assistance with rent costs on a short-term basis, will continue to be met through the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Government has asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to submit detailed proposals for the new scheme so that final decisions on the implementation of the new arrangements can be taken. It is expected that this will take about six months and a further two year timeframe is envisaged for introducing the new arrangements once the detailed proposals have been agreed. This will deliver an important element of the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, which commits the Government to the maximum co-ordination of housing policy under one Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue in the hope that the Minister for Health and Children will seriously reconsider a decision he has made on the drugs refund scheme. I refer to the new arrangement whereby adult children between the ages of 23 and 25 years, who reside in the family home and who are still in full-time education are caught in a bind. On the one hand, the new drugs refund scheme, introduced by the Minster, only allows those who are 23 years of age or younger to be included on a family card so that 23 to 25 year olds are not classified as dependants for the purposes of the scheme. This is in keeping with the definition of a dependant set out in the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996. On the other hand, as I am sure the Minister is aware, most persons in this age group are precluded from qualifying for a medical card except in very exceptional circumstances because up to the age of 25 years they are regarded as dependants and are, therefore, assessed on parental income.</P>
      <P>For the few people who are affected by this change the discrepancy is ridiculous. The Department of Health and Children has adopted a system whereby people in this age group are classified as not being dependent while the health boards have adopted a procedure whereby they are classified as being dependent. This means they are disallowed from inclusion on the family card while not being entitled to a medical card either.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to address this discrepancy in the drugs refund scheme by making exceptions for persons in full-time education up to the age of 25 years for the following reasons: Presumably the Minister was seeking consistency when he made the decision to base the scheme on the Family Law Act. However, he has introduced the inconsistency to which I have already referred. Clients of the health boards are entitled to some consistency between the old drugs payments scheme and the new one. That the State provides such a scheme is a recognition of the cost to families and individuals and to simply strike off a category of people without due consideration of its effect is unfair.</P>
      <P>This problem affects very few people &ndash; only a few thousand, if that &ndash; who are mostly pursuing postgraduate courses. The expenditure implications are minute, considering the age profile of the group. However, such a change would make a considerable difference to a family with, say, a history of asthma or other long-term illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For any new scheme discrepancies will inevitably arise between existing and old schemes. However, as legislators it is our responsibility to address them as they become apparent and that <Col N="367" /><Col N="368" /> is what I am attempting to do this evening. I hope the Minister will address this discrepancy as a matter of urgency and give a commitment to do so this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my Government colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. Everyone who is ordinarily resident in Ireland has either category one or category two eligibility for health services, depending on personal income. People with category one eligibility receive a medical card and can avail of services under the general medical services scheme. Entitlement to a medical card is means tested and depends on personal income and circumstances. A medical card normally covers the card holder, his or her spouse and any children under 16. It also covers people over 16, such as students, who are dependent on the medical card holder.</P>
      <P>The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant is made by the relevant health board on the basis of personal circumstances. Similarly, in the case of an individual who lives in a family home and applies for a medical card in his or her own right, health boards take the individual's income and circumstances into account when deciding on the application. Ultimately, under the Health Act, 1977, granting of a medical card is entirely at the discretion of the chief executive officer of the health board or his or her dedicated staff.</P>
      <P>People who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, but who do not qualify for a medical card automatically have category two eligibility and are entitled to services available to people in this category, including the new drug payment scheme. Under this scheme, individuals or families need only pay the first £42 in any month on approved drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances which were prescribed by a registered medical practitioner and were for the treatment of the person or his or her dependants. The balance of the cost is met by the State.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the scheme, dependants include spouse and children under 18 years. A dependant with a physical disability or a mental handicap or illness who cannot maintain himself or herself fully, who is ordinarily resident in the family home and who does not hold a current medical card, may be included in the family expenditure under this scheme regardless of age. Dependants over 18 years and under the age of 23 years who are in full-time education are also included. The upper age limit is in keeping with recent family law legislation &ndash; the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996. A person over the age of 18 years, and who is not in full-time education, or a person who is over the age of 23 years and is in full-time education, can avail of the drug payment scheme in his or her own right or may be eligible for a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme are two separate schemes, one of which is means tested while the other is not. As I mentioned earlier, there is automatic entitlement to the drug payment scheme, while health boards take account of personal circumstances in making decisions on the provision of medical cards. I do not see any discrepancies between the operation of the two schemes, which as I say, are different in nature.</P>
    <P>It is important to outline the advantages the new drug payment scheme has over previous community drugs schemes. The drug payment scheme is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for most families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. For example, under the old drug refund scheme, families and individuals paid the full cost of their prescription medicines and, at the end of the quarter, claimed reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. This caused considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals with heavy ongoing expenditure on medication.</P>
    <P>However, families and individuals will now be able to budget for the cost of medicines. In addition, there were families where, although one member qualified for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which could be considerable, could not be recouped until the end of the quarter. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    <P>That the drug payment scheme operates on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example in one month have expenditure of, say, £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month. That is a major change.</P>
    <P>The new drug payment scheme is for everyone. Unlike the drug cost subsidisation scheme, there are no qualifying criteria. All in all, the new drug payment scheme provides a better deal for most families. I hope this is to the satisfaction of both the Deputy and the House.</P>

      <P>For many years the community in Knocklyon has been awaiting the construction of the Knocklyon post-primary school. In the 1997 general election, the two Government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, promised the school would be built and opened by September 1998. This became September 1999 and then September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago, the Minister for Education and Science confirmed that the school would open in September 2000 and that the project was at an advanced stage. The difficulty that now arises is that there are parents, in the Knocklyon <Col N="370" /> area who must make arrangements to ensure that children attend post-primary education starting next September. These parents are not all totally convinced the school will open in 2000 and they now find themselves in a position whereby children offered places in other second level schools within a one to three mile radius of Knocklyon are requiring the parents, in the context of private education, to pay an advance deposit to secure a place for the year 2000. Many parents who want their children to attend Knocklyon community school find themselves compelled, due to the absence of post-primary schools in the local community, to place their children's names down for private schools within a reasonable distance of the Knocklyon area.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that neither a board nor a principal has been appointed for the running of the community school. Parents cannot place their children's names down as potential students to attend at the school in September 2000. No assurance can be given to them in writing that the school will be built and open or that places will be available to their children. Not only is there no board or principal, no teachers have been recruited and it is not known if any difficulties will be experienced in this context.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify the position? Will immediate steps be taken to appoint a principal and a board of management? Will arrangements be put in place to enable parents to place their children's names down for attendance at the school at the start of the next academic year? Will an administrative system be put in place to confirm places in the school to parents who wish their children to attend?</P>
    <P>This is extremely urgent for many parents and the difficulties in which many now find themselves is that, even if the school opens, because of the uncertain position, they may find themselves already having paid non-refundable deposits to other schools to secure places. This is an urgent issue which needs to be addressed before the House goes into recess for Christmas.</P>

I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter as it affords me the opportunity of outlining to the House our Department's arrangements for the enrolment of pupils in the new community school in Knocklyon.</P>
      <P>Normally it is the function of a board of management to develop, promulgate and effect an enrolment policy. In the case of a new community school on a greenfield site, it is first necessary to establish trusteeship. This is followed by the appointment of a board of management to carry out, among other duties, the enrolment of pupils. For a community school, trusteeship normally consists of the relevant vocational education committee and the religious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Knocklyon community <Col N="371" /> school, the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee has already accepted trusteeship of the new school and has made its nominations to the board of management. In the appointment of religious trustees, discussions are still ongoing with the Dublin archdiocese. It is hoped that these will be concluded shortly and that an interim board of management will be in place before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I understand the anxiety of parents in Knocklyon regarding the enrolment of pupils for September 2000, and I acknowledge that there is an urgent need to take early action on this matter. In the circumstances, we have put arrangements in place to allow applications for enrolment to be submitted while the interim board of management is being constituted. In this regard, we have accepted an offer made by the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools to initiate and manage the enrolment application process before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made by our Department for the association to publicise the enrolment locally as appropriate and to accept com<Col N="372" /> pleted enrolment forms on behalf of the interim board of management. The board will take the final decision on enrolment when it has been constituted. The details regarding enrolment are being finalised in our Department and will be publicised locally at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>In addition, officials from our Department have been in touch with the Knocklyon PostPrimary Committee and the other relevant parties regarding all matters relating to the development of this school, including enrolment. There is no compulsion on anyone to pay deposits for the enrolment of their children. It is at the discretion of parents whether they do that.</P>
    <P>This is a project to which the Government has given a high priority. Some Deputies questioned our commitment to it, but I am sure they will acknowledge that we are delivering where others failed to do so. This latest move will ensure that everything will remain on track for the opening of this important new educational facility in a nice location in south Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 November 1999.</P>

      <P>The total provision in the 2000 Estimates for inland waterways is £12.473 million of which £6.272 million is provided for current expenditure and £6.201 million for capital works. Of the provision of £6.201 million for capital works, some £2 million is earmarked for completion of projects already under way such as the improvement of navigation in Limerick city, extension of the Suck navigation to Ballinasloe and extension of navigation to Boyle. The balance of £4.2 million will be expended on new projects and sundry items such as acquisition of property to facilitate works and purchase of plant and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, the full programme of works for 2000 has not yet been decided but I anticipate that a start can be made on projects such as the completion of restoration of the Royal Canal, a new harbour at Ballyleague, the provision of additional moorings at various locations on the Shannon navigation, including Shannonbridge, and additional landing stages at locks on the Grand Canal and the Barrow navigation. It is envisaged that the future annual capital funding over the period of the plan will be of the same order as for the year 2000. Under the national development plan it is intended to further develop the Shannon navigation and the Shannon/Erne waterway by improving facilities at existing locations and adding new destinations to cater for increased usage of the system; and con<Col N="374" /> tinue to restore, improve and develop the canals and Barrow navigation to attract new visitors and provide a catalyst for regeneration in less developed areas.</P>
    <P>Details of all the projects to be carried out under the plan have not yet been decided but I hope to complete this process early in 2000. This is a very substantial investment in the waterways and will lead to a much enhanced product that will enable us to consolidate and expand the tourism market for waterways-associated holidays and activities and help spread the tourism benefits to the many small rural communities along the waterways corridors.</P>
    <P>I must also mention, however, that the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, passed earlier this year by both Houses of the Oireachtas but yet to be brought into force pending the setting up of the Northern Ireland Executive, provides for the establishment of Waterways Ireland, a North/South Implementation Body for inland waterways. Waterways Ireland will have the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system throughout this island, principally for recreational purposes. When the body comes into being, I will have discussions with my counterpart in Northern Ireland regarding inland waterways and the programme to be pursued by Waterways Ireland and, of course, these discussions will be continuous in the context of the proposed North/South Ministerial Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the offshore islands was assigned to my Department in July 1997. Since then my Department has highlighted its commitment to the development of the islands and island life and in particular sought to provide the islanders with adequate levels of services by funding numerous infrastructural projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having visited most of the inhabited offshore islands and having met with the island communi<Col N="375" /> ties and their representatives, I decided at the outset that one of the main priorities would be the provision of a minimum level of secure transport between the islands and the mainland. An analysis of the access requirements was carried out by my Department together with an examination of the landing facilities both on the islands and the mainland.</P>
    <P>As a result during 1998, I sanctioned £1.7 million for works on piers serving five of the islands off the Cork coast, with work on those piers commencing in 1998 and expected to be completed in 1999. Also in 1998, I allocated a sum of £0.696 million to current projects, including the provision and improvement of ferry services to the islands. This funding enabled my Department to improve conditions for the islanders with the funding assisting the passenger and freight service from Galway and Ros a'Mhíl to the Aran Islands as well as the provision of a ferry service between Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island and the mainland.</P>
    <P>I have this year approved three year contracts for the provision of improved passenger ferry services to the Aran Islands and Inishbofin, County Galway and Inishturk and Clare Island, County Mayo with effect from 1 September 1999. Tenders were recently invited for the provision of &ndash; for the first time ever &ndash; subsidised ferry services for Whiddy, Sherkin and Bear Island off the County Cork coast. It is my intention to have these new services up and running on 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>Given the location of islands, it is more difficult for islanders to share in the economic and social life of the nation as a whole. It is important therefore that necessary infrastructural facilities be provided on the islands in order to sustain the island population and cater for visitors. In 1998 a sum of £2.34 million was spent on various infrastructural projects on the offshore islands and this facilitated a comprehensive programme of works that resulted in the improvement of many of the roads, piers and public services on the islands. Various projects were co-funded with local authorities &ndash; during 1998 I sanctioned a total of £1.3 million for this purpose. I also sanctioned a grant of £150,000 to enable three co-operatives on the Aran Islands to establish a refuse recycling scheme, work on which is expected to be completed in 2000.</P>
    <P>A grant of some £540,000 was made to the Electricity Supply Board for the provision of additional electricity supply on eight offshore islands during the year. This amount covered half the cost of electrifying those islands with the balance being covered by the ESB. In addition a grant of £75,000 was paid to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in respect of the foreshore licences necessary for these works.</P>
    <P>So far in 1999, I have allocated over £2.9 million for a further programme of works aimed at improving the physical infrastructure of the islands. Included again in this programme is fund<Col N="376" /> ing for smaller projects such as roads, small piers and coastal protection on the islands together with funding for major works such as £825,000 for marine works at Leadbh Gharbh, Arranmore, County Donegal and a similar sum for the construction of a new bridge serving Inishnee, County Galway.</P>
    <P>Many other Departments and State agencies have responsibilities in relation to various aspects of island development. Under my chairmanship the Interdepartmental Committee for the Islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish Language with participation from all Departments, has played a vital role in the co-ordination of essential services for island communities at ground level and has ensured that Government policy is being implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner. Regular bilateral meetings with Departments, health boards, local authorities, etc., ensure that services to the islands are enhanced and rationalised and that inadequacies with regard to the provision of services are remedied where possible.</P>
    <P>Despite the large amount of work already undertaken much remains to be done. It is my intention, to continue to promote the sustainable development of the populated offshore islands and to improve the quality of island access and infrastructure in the coming years, including where necessary the provision of air services to a number of islands.</P>

      <P>I am happy to assure the Deputy, from the outset, that my overriding concern in addressing the needs of Ennis Friary is to ensure that the stonework and other infrastructure at this important national monument will be preserved and protected for future generations. I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 199 of 1 July 1999. At that time, I intimated that it was originally planned to use funding from the Operational Programme for Tourism, OPT, 1994-99 to carry out works on this 13th century friary to the vaulted sacristy and latrine tower to the east of the friary site and to include an enhanced tourism attraction at the site. The main objective of this proposal was to allow for the housing indoors of the magnificent McMahon and O'Brien/Creagh tombs, with their stone panels of exceptional quality, which have deteriorated in recent years as a result of atmospheric pollution. As the Deputy will also be aware, following concerns expressed locally and arising from my own examination of the plans, I was not happy with the proposals and instructed that the <Col N="377" /> OPT funding be re-directed for works at the monastic site at Scattery Island, County Clare. Of course, it was always my intention to again allocate sufficient funding for Ennis Friary when suitable proposals were arrived at.</P>
      <P>I also intimated, at that time that as an alternative to the earlier scheme, I was considering two options which would either: house the stone panels in the area of the adjoining stables, orpreserve the panels outdoors using a specialist treatment on a cyclical basis.</P>
      <P>The present position in so far as housing the panels in the stables area is concerned is that a feasibility scheme has been carried out which has confirmed that, in order to present the panels as a discrete non-fragmented tomb located in a properly controlled environment with a natural light setting where the intricate stone carvings could be best appreciated, a building, at least equally, if not even more obtrusive than that which was originally proposed, would be required. Such a development within the confines of the friary would be most inappropriate, in my view, and would thus be unacceptable to me. There remains an option to present the panels in an alternative, fragmented, manner within a building in the stables area which would remain faithful to the existing skyline of that area, but my Department does not own this site and I am not aware that the site in question is for sale.</P>
      <P>The option of retaining the panels outdoors and treating them to withstand the atmospheric pollution is also being considered and I am awaiting advice from my officials as to whether this method of conservation is feasible and acceptable. I expect to be in a position to make a final decision on the necessary works at Ennis friary very soon. In this regard, I should inform the Deputy that, since the Friary itself is generally in good condition, I have no plans for its full restoration. However, I can assure the Deputy that I am prepared to make the necessary funds available to carry out the works at the friary once I made the relevant decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-06 published on Monday last the Government is committed to facilitating the further development of the State's arts and culture infrastructure. I envisage that the following elements will form part of the new programme provision for new regional/city/county projects: redevelopment of existing cultural infrastructure facilities; and support for community based projects. I would hope to formally launch the programme, including the criteria that will have to be met to receive grant assistance, and call for applications early in the new year.</P>

      <P>Tháinig na hoileáin amach ón gcósta faoi chúram mo Roinnse i mí Iúil 1997. Tar éis dom cuairt a thabhairt ar fhormhór na n-oileán le daonra orthu agus tar éis dom labhairt le pobal na n-oileán ba léir gurb é an rud ba mhó a bhí le déanamh ná go soláthrófaí íosleibhéal inmhianaithe iompair do gach oileán. Rinneadh ainilís ar riachtanais rochtana na n-oileán, chomh maith le scrúdú ar na háiseanna teacht i dtír.</P>
      <P>Mar thoradh air seo caitheadh suim £2.34 milliún i 1998 ar thionscadail éagsúla infrastruchtúir ar oileáin amach ón gcósta. Ceadaiodh £1.7 milliún do chéibheanna a dhéanann freastal ar chúig cinn de na hoileáin amach ó chósta Chorcaí. Dháil mé £696,000 i rith 1998 do thionscadail reatha, ar a n-áirítear seirbhísí farantóireachta a sholáthar agus a fheabhsú chuig na hoileáin. Chuidigh an maoiniú seo le seirbhís paisinéirí agus lastais as Gaillimh agus Ros a'Mhíl go hÁrainn chomh maith le seirbhís farantóireachta idir Inis Bó Finne, Inis Túirc agus Oileán Chliara agus an mórthír.</P>
      <P>Go dtí seo i 1999, tá os cionn £2.9 milliún ceadaithe agam i gcomhair cláir nua d'oibreacha chun infrastruchtúr fisiciúil na n-oileán a fheabhsú. Curtha san áireamh sa chlár seo tá airgead i gcomhair miontograí ar a n-áirítear bóithre, céibheanna beaga agus oibreacha cosaint chósta ar na hoileáin, mar aon le h-airgead i gcomhair móroibreacha, eadhon, £825,000 le haghaidh saoraidí calaíochta ag Léadbh Gharbh, Árainn Mhór, Contae Dhún na nGall a fhorbairt agus suim chomhionann le haghaidh droichead nua a thógail ag Inis Ní, Condae na Gaillimhe.</P>
      <P>Maidir le seirbhísí farantóireachta, tá conarthaí nua trí bliana ceadaithe agam chun seirbhísí feabhsaithe do phaisinéirí a chur ar fáil do na hOileáin Árann agus Inis Bó Finne, Contae na Gaillimhe agus d'Inis Túirc agus Oileán Chliara, Contae Mhaigh Eo le héifeacht ó 1 Mean Fómhair 1999. Chomh maith leis sin, iarradh le déanaí, den chéad uair riamh, tairiscintí le haghaidh seirbhísí farantóireachta idir Oileán Faoide, Oileán Béara agus Inis Earcáin, Contae Chorcaí agus an mórthír. Tá i gceist agam go mbeidh na seirbhísí sin ag tosú ar 1 Eanáir 2000.</P>
      <P>I measc na gcéimeanna atá tógtha agam chun feabhas a chur ar shaol sóisialta agus cultúrtha na n-oileán tá deontais £142,000 agus £80,000 ceadaithe agam i mbliana le haghaidh forbairt ionaid pobail Oileán Thoraí agus páirc peile Inis Oírr faoi seach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá dualgais ar go leor ranna Stáit eile i leith gnéithe eagsúla d'fhorbairt na n-oileán. Faoi mo chathaoirleacht féin, tá ról lárnach tógtha ag an gcoiste idir-rannach do na hOileáin, an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge i gcomhordú seirbhísí riachtanacha do phobail oileánda ag an bun leibhéal agus tá cinntithe aige go bhfuil polasaí an Rialtais á chur i bhfeidhm ar bhealach com<Col N="382" /> hordaithe agus éifeachtach. Reachtáiltear cruinnithe rialta dáthaobhacha le ranna Stáit, boird sláinte, udaráis aitiúla etc., go gcuirtear feabhas agus cóimheas ar na seirbhísí do na hoileáin agus chun leigheas ar laigeachtaí i leith na seirbhísí a chur ar fáil nuair is féidir.</P>
    <P>I spiorad na comhpháirtíochta beidh mé féin agus oifigigh mo Roinne  &ndash; mar a bhíomar go dtí seo &ndash; i dteagmháil rialta leis na hoileánaigh agus leis na heagrais a dhéanann ionadaíocht thar a gceann mar shampla, comharchumainn, coistí forbartha, Comhdháil Oileán ha hÉireann.</P>
    <P>In aineoinn an méid oibre atá déanta, tá go leor fós le déanamh. Tá i gceist agam sna blianta amach romhainn, leanúint le forbairt chothaitheach na n-oileán a bhfuil daonra orthu a chur chun cinn agus le caighdeán na rochtaine chuig na h-oileáin agus a n-infrastruchtúr a fheabhsú &ndash; seirbhísí aer chuig roinnt oileáin san áireamh, nuair is gá.</P>

      <P>Of the £3.95 million which has been allocated in 2000 for cultural development, £3.6 million is in respect of capital development. This funding will finance the continued development of infrastructural projects that have already been approved for funding, including projects under the cultural development incentives scheme.

      <P>The balance of the funding in subhead C3 of my Department's Vote for 2000 is £350,000 in current funding. This will be used to finance the establishment of a music board and to provide the Government's contribution towards the cost of staging a major exhibition of Irish culture in the Kennedy Center, Washington D.C., in May 2000. The amount of current funding available under this heading in 1999 is £350,000 and relates to the Irish Government's contribution to the Kennedy Center festival.</P>

This fund is to provide a mechanism through which the national collecting institutions may acquire, in exceptional circumstances, cultural artefacts of high value. The formal mechanism created by way of subhead C4 has effectively now been activated by the provision in the Estimates for 2000 of a sum of £500,000.

      <P>The National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks has recorded a total of 320,000 visits to its exhibition galleries since the opening of the museum to the public on 18 September 1997 until the week beginning 16 November 1999. This does not take account however of visitors to the museum site for special events, lectures and activities which are held in Collins Barracks but outside the exhibition gallery spaces.</P>
      <P>The total number of visitors of 320,000 is slightly down on pre-opening projections. The continuous improvement and extension of facilities, the provision of additional services, the establishment in the public mind of the existence of Collins Barracks as a National Museum facility, the improved access to the site and the full implementation of a new marketing plan are designed to achieve an increase in visitor numbers over the coming years.          </P>

      <P>Conservation works are under way at Kinneigh Round Tower. These works include the removal of vegetation, repointing of joints, resetting of displaced stones and the fitting of doors, windows and grids. Following the completion of the conservation works, further presentation works will be carried out involving the upgrading of the access to the tower itself and the laying of a gravel path around it. The feasibility of allowing access within the tower will be assessed during the course of the works. A new information plaque will also be erected at the site. It is expected that these works will be completed early next year.</P>
      <P>The bequest made towards the restoration works, of which I am aware, will greatly assist in the carrying out of the works.</P>
      <P>This round tower is unique in that its base is hexagonal for about six metres from the ground and then turns round in profile. It is built of slate stone of the locality, with large stones in the base and smaller ones high up, and is founded on the rock. It has a square-headed doorway and an internal ladder leads to the top which was altered in the last century to make a belfry.</P>

      <P>The total Estimate for 2000 in respect of inland waterways is £12,473,000 which compares with an Estimate of £9,696,000 for 1999. As the Deputy is aware, the T Subhead was divided earlier this year into T1 and T2 to allow for the financing of Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways to be established under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999 and which is to come into force when the Northern Ireland Executive is set up.</P>
      <P>It is essential to provide the mechanism in the 2000 Estimate for the funding of Waterways Ireland but, as the start-up date remains uncertain, it was decided that at this stage a token provision only should be made in T1 for the expenditure that will arise in respect of maintenance-development of the inland waterways.

    <P>WTO members are currently trying to finalise a ministerial declaration for adoption at Seattle <Col N="393" /> which will cover the scope and modalities of the proposed negotiations. This process is proving to be slow as many Members are trying to influence the outcome of the negotiations before they start.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on the new round has been developed in co-operation with our European Union partners, in keeping with our treaty obligations, and EU submissions have been made to the WTO outlining the Union's views on the new round. The EU approach has been to call for a comprehensive round of trade negotiations involving a broad range of issues. It is my belief that this is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Addressing the concerns of developing countries is a key strategy in the EU approach to the new round. Special and differential treatment for developing countries is already a cornerstone of existing WTO agreements and in the new round there is a need to examine how these provisions can be implemented or changed so as to have a better impact for developing countries. The traditional approach has mainly been to base special and differential treatment for developing countries on extended implementation periods. Other methods, including human development indicators, can be examined during the future negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition to special and differential treatment, Ireland, along with the EU, will sponsor a call for duty and tariff free market access for products from least developed countries to all markets by 2003. Capacity building, technical assistance and coherence between international bodies have also been identified by the EU as a contribution to the developing countries concerns.</P>
    <P>Developing countries themselves are actively involved in addressing their particular concerns for the new round and considerable time has been spent on implementation issues in the discussions on the draft ministerial declaration. Given that the WTO operates by consensus, the approval of developing countries to any final arrangements will be essential before the negotiations can be successfully concluded.</P>
    <P>Ireland with the EU has called for the new round negotiations to cover investment. We are seeking the establishment of a multilateral framework of rules governing international investment world-wide. A framework of multi-lateral rules for investment has to ensure the right conditions for international investment to be conducive to sustainable development. Such a framework should preserve the ability of host countries to <Col N="394" /> regulate the activity of investors, whether foreign or domestic, on their territory, for the achievement of legitimate policy objectives. Given that the ability to open a country's domestic market to international investment differs greatly among WTO members, Ireland believes that a bottom-up approach to the question of admission, based on commitments undertaken by each member, is the way to allow for the flexibility that many WTO members require.</P>
    <P>A central benchmark of the new round should be the WTO's overall objective of sustainable development. Trade and environment policies should play a mutually supportive role in favour of sustainable development. Environmental considerations should be addressed throughout the negotiations so as to achieve by the end of the Round an overall outcome where environmentally friendly consequences can be identified in the relevant parts of the final package. In the negotiations, priority should be given to establishing greater legal clarity on the relationship between WTO rules and trade measures taken pursuant to multilateral environmental agreements. Consensus should be sought on the accommodation within WTO rules of trade measures taken pursuant to MEAs. Clarification is also necessary of the relationship between WTO rules and non-product related process and production methods requirements and, in particular, eco-labelling schemes. Clarification is also required in order to secure within the relevant WTO rules, the importance of the precautionary principle and to agree on multilateral criteria for the scope of action possible under the principle.</P>

      <P>The new human resources EU initiative, EQUAL, will run from 2000 to 2006. The EQUAL initiative aims to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market by way of innovative projects involving local consortia and transnational partners. EQUAL will address selected themes and is centred around the four pillars of the employment action plans of the member states encompassing employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities between <Col N="396" /> women and men. The amount of EU funding available will be 32 million euro, over £25 million.</P>
      <P>The EQUAL initiative is currently in draft form. The draft document will be submitted to the ESF committee and the European Parliament in December 1999 for approval and is expected to be published in the official journal by January 2000. The operational programme for Ireland will then be drafted by my Department in consultation with the appropriate groups and organisations and submitted to the European Commission for negotiation. It is expected that the Commission Decision finalising the details of the EQUAL programme for Ireland will subsequently issue in September 2000.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that a public call for project proposals will take place in autumn 2000 with a view to project activity commencing late 2000 or early 2001.</P>

      <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1995, has as its main purpose the delegation of all operational functions in relation to casual trading from central government to local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have not had occasion to meet the Irish Organisation of Market and Street Traders but my officials, as a courtesy, have met representatives of that body on a number of occasions since the coming into force of the Casual Trading Act, 1995. The meetings have normally been concerned with discussions on the implementation of the Act and problems encountered by traders with local authorities. It must be understood that under this law it is the elected local authorities who now control the operation of casual trading. Accordingly, it is to those bodies that representations should now be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>State policy in relation to natural resources and spin off industry is as follows.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to oil and gas activities is to licence private enterprise to conduct exploration and production under terms which balance the interests of the State with those of private enterprise. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that the activity is conducted in an effective and efficient manner, that operations are carried out in accordance with best practices, and that there is effective liaison with the industry.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to maximise the benefits to the national economy from exploration for, and production of, oil and gas resources, while ensuring that activities are conducted safely and with due regard to their impact on the environment and other land/sea users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said in reply to previous parliamentary questions, I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators' Association, and the individual operators, that Irish suppliers of goods and services and indeed Irish workers should be given opportunities to participate in such activities, and I will continue to do so. Indeed, at my suggestion a framework group, comprising my Department, ICTU, Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Offshore Operators' Association, the Irish Offshore Services Association and FÁS, was established late last year to discuss matters relating to the utilisation of Irish resources, <Col N="399" /> services and manpower in the oil and gas industry.</P>
    <P>Last week the Irish Offshore Operators' Association published a report detailing the contribution of the Irish oil and gas exploration and production operations to the Irish economy. The report identified direct expenditure on production operations of £9.3 million in 1998, resulting in a total contribution to the economy of £19.8 million and a full time equivalent employment of 387.</P>
    <P>The association has also committed itself to a policy of giving full and fair opportunities to qualified and competitive suppliers of Irish goods and services, recommending a programme of action which will strengthen the opportunities for Irish suppliers to compete in the Irish offshore as well as internationally.</P>
    <P>There are currently extant three State mining licences and 13 State mining leases. Many of these are small scale but the zinc-lead mines at Navan, County Meath, Galmoy, County Kilkenny and Lisheen, County Tipperary between them rank Ireland as the seventh largest world mining producer of zinc At Knocknacran, County Monaghan, the open cast quarry produces gypsum which is a major raw material in the manufacture of plasters, plasterboard and cement. The direct employment in these mines is over 1,000 with an estimated 3,600 in related indirect employment and the contribution to the Exchequer and local economy amounts to some £45 million per year in addition to the payroll.</P>
    <P>I will continue to encourage further inward investment in exploration and mining in Ireland to ensure the economic development of our mineral resources, and so provide employment in the sector. My Department also responds to enquiries about locally available services by maintaining an inventory of service providers to the mining and prospecting sector and by putting individuals in contact with companies.</P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to the forestry sector is set out in the strategic plan for the development of forestry in Ireland, &ldquo;Growing for the Future&rdquo;, which was published in 1996.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of the strategic plan is to develop forestry to a scale and in a manner which maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis and which is compatible with the protection of the environment. It is anticipated that approx 11,000 jobs can be created in forestry in the period to 2020 if the programme set out on the plan is implemented.</P>

      <P>The article by Javier Solana in a recent issue of <i>Le Monde</i> ranges across a number of issues. On the specific point of capacities for Petersberg Tasks raised by the Deputy, this is in line with the commitment to Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the approach set out in the Cologne conclusions of the European Council in June of this year. The Cologne conclusions emphasised the importance of developing the EU's capability for non-military crisis management also. The Finnish Presidency intends to submit progress reports on both the military and non-military aspect of crisis management to the forthcoming Helsinki European Council next month. I refer the Deputy to the answer I gave in this House to Deputy Gay Mitchell on 2 November.</P>
      <P>I have known Javier Solana for some years, since we were both Ministers for Foreign Affairs in 1992. I have met him on a number of occasions. Recently, in his capacity as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, he attended the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels on the 15 November. I was glad to see him assuming his important EU responsibilities. He is well aware of Ireland's views. At the recent Council meeting, I underlined the important and positive role which he could play in bringing EU influence to bear, including for conflict prevention, at the earliest possible stage of a potential crisis, in accordance with the objectives of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>

      <P>The Tobin tax seeks to impose a world wide tax on all foreign exchange transactions to reduce exchange rate volatility and to raise revenue to support international development.</P>
      <P>While one can acknowledge the motives of those seeking to impose such a tax, the majority of expert opinion appears to be that the proposed tax suffers from severe pragmatic flaws, primarily due to enforcement problems. Whatever the theoretical merits of the tax, and there is some debate on that, a Tobin tax would require global co-operation. Otherwise, foreign exchange business would gravitate quickly to any country that did not enforce the tax. In this light, the probability of every country in the world applying such a tax, or of one country applying it unilaterally must be open to question.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty is payable by the buyer on the purchase of a property. The seller has no liability to stamp duty. However, there could be a capital gains tax liability for the seller on the disposal of an asset. When an asset is disposed of, a capital gain arises on the increase in the asset's value over the period of ownership. This gain is liable to capital gains tax, in general, at a rate of 20%. The orig <Col N="404" /> inal acquisition cost of the asset is adjusted upwards for inflation, so that the real rather the nominal gain is subject to tax.</P>
      <P>The case outlined by the Deputy may qualify for exemption from capital gains tax under section 609 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which provides that any gains accruing to charities are not liable to capital gains tax. However, the information provided does not contain enough detail for this point to be answered. It is suggested that the parties affected should contact the Revenue Commissioners to explore this possibility.</P>

    <P>In relation to the limit on accounts, I presume that the Deputy is referring to investment limits and these are set out as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Summary of Limits on Accounts</i>Individuals, including married persons who choose not to invest jointly with their spouses, may invest up to £75,000 in one special savings account, SSA, or up to £75,000 in one investment in any special investment product or up to £50,000 in one special savings account and up to £25,000 in one investment in any other special investment product or up to £25,000 in one special savings account and up to £50,000 in one investment in any other special savings product.</P>
    <P>A married couple investing jointly may invest in one or two joint special savings accounts, up to £75,000 in each account or in one or two joint investments in other special investment products, up to £75,000 in each investment or up to £50,000 in each of two joint special savings accounts and up to £50,000 in one investment in any other special investment product or up to £50,000 in each of two joint special savings accounts and up to £25,000 in each of two investments in any other special investments products or up to £50,000 in one joint special savings account and up to £50,000 in each of two investments in any other special investment products or up to £25,000 in each of two joint special savings accounts and up to £50,000 in each of two investments in any other special investment products.</P>
    <P>Where a special portfolio investment account, SPIA, is opened on or before 5 April 2000, a further amount up to £10,000 can be invested in the SPIA at any time without breaching the above limits, provided that it is invested in companies quoted on the developing companies market, DCM. The increased limit applies only so long as the SPIA continues to hold the DCM investment. Where the DCM investment is sold, the original limits apply once more to the SPIA. There are no tax free thresholds below which DIRT is not deductible.</P>
    <P>The conditions for investment in special investment products are: investors must be individuals of full age, i.e. 18 or over or married. The investment cannot be held through a nominee. It must be held directly by the beneficial holder of the investment.</P>
    <P>It is unclear to what other conditions the Deputy is referring. For example, DIRT is refundable in certain circumstances to persons <Col N="406" /> over 65 or the permanently incapacitated. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are forwarding copies of Revenue leaflets which may be of assistance to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed of the following by the Revenue Commissioners. The total amount of VAT collected in 1998, net of repayments was £4,266 million. The amount collected for the 21% standard rate was £2,718 million and for the 12.5% reduced rate was £1,646 million and there is a negative figure of £98 million in respect of the farmers flat rate. These are rounded figures, based on estimates derived from trading details supplied by VAT registered traders. The negative figure for the farmers flat rate reflects the net effect of the VAT yield on livestock, greyhounds and the hire of horses, offset by the amount of credit claimed under the flat rate scheme by VAT registered customers such as co-ops or meat factories in respect of participating unregistered farmers.</P>
      <P>The standard rate must be a minimum of 15%. In the context of the most recent Council Directive (99/49/EC) on the standard rate, member states undertook to use their best efforts to avoid widening the current span of ten percentage points above the lowest standard rate applying in the different member states.</P>
      <P>Member states have the option of applying one or two reduced rates, subject to a minimum of 5% to a specified list of goods and services. As a transitional arrangement, member states have the option of applying a &ldquo;parking rate&rdquo; which must be one of the reduced rates and must be at least 12% to items which were on a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, but which were not on the reduced rate list. Member states have the option of retaining the zero rates they had in force on 1 January 1991. If items are moved from the zero rate, a minimum rate of 5% would have to be applied, although a reduced or standard rate could also apply.</P>
      <P>The reduced rate of 12.5% applies to electricity and gas, while telephone services attract the standard 21% rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following rates based on information available to the Revenue Commissioners, apply in EU member states in respect of electricity, Portugal (5%), Luxembourg (6%), Greece (8%), Italy (10%), Germany (16%), Spain (16%), Netherlands (17.5%), Austria (20%), Belgium (21%), Finland (22%), Sweden (25%), Denmark (25%). France applies both 5.5% and a standard rate of <Col N="408" /> 20.6% while the UK applies 5% with a standard rate of 17.5%.</P>
    <P>The following rates apply to EU member states in respect of gas. Luxembourg (6%), Greece (8%) , Italy (10%), Germany (16%), Spain (16%), Portugal (17%), Netherlands (17.5%), Austria (20%), Belgium (21%), Finland (22%), Sweden (25%) Denmark (25%). France applies both 5.5% and a standard rate of 20.6%, while the UK applies 5% for domestic consumers and a standard rate of 17.5%.</P>
    <P>The following rates apply to EU member states in respect of telephone services. Austria (10%), Luxembourg (15%), Germany (16%), Spain (16%), Portugal (17%), Netherlands (17.5%), UK (17.5%), Greece (18%), Italy (20%), France (20.6%), Belgium (21%), Finland 22%), Sweden (25%) Denmark (25%).</P>
    <P>These rates must be seen in the context of rate structure in each member state. In particular most member states do not have zero rates for food for example, allowing lower standard rates.</P>
    <P>Any changes to VAT rates is a matter for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When inheritance tax was introduced by the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 1976, the exempt thresholds in existence at that time were as follows: Class I: £150,000 &ndash; where the recipient is a spouse, child, or minor child of a deceased child (i.e. certain grandchildren) of the disponer. Class II: £15,000 &ndash; where the recipient is a lineal ancestor or lineal descendent (other than those covered by Class I) of the disponer. Class III: £10,000 &ndash; where the recipient is a brother or a sister, or a child of a brother or of a sister, of the disponer. Class IV: £5,000 &ndash; where the recipient does not fall within Classes I, II, or III (i.e. non-lineal relations and strangers).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, there are three exempt class thresholds as follows: Class I: £192,900 &ndash; where the recipient is a child, or minor child of a deceased child (i.e. certain grandchildren) of the disponer. This threshold also applies to a parent where he or she takes an absolute inheritance on the death of a child. Stepchildren and legally adopted children are also entitled to the £192,900 threshold. Since 1985, inheritances taken by spouses are exempt from capital acquisitions tax; Class II: £25,720 &ndash; where the recipient is a brother, sister, nephew, <Col N="409" /> niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendent of the disponer, other than those covered by Class I; Class III: £12,860 &ndash; where the recipient does not fall within Classes I or II, i.e. non-lineal relations and strangers.</P>
    <P>Capital acquisitions tax is charged on the value of the inheritance in excess of the relevant exempt threshold. Since 1990, these thresholds have been indexed to the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>There is no data available from the Central Statistics Office for the average industrial wage in 1976. However, data is available for the average manufacturing weekly wage for that year, which was £52.50. In 1999, the average industrial weekly wage is £305.57, based on figures to date.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the Dáil earlier this year, during the Finance Bill debate, and in response to parliamentary questions in recent months, that I would examine the capital acquisitions tax code, including inheritance tax, in detail for the forthcoming budget. This examination is currently taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms and conditions governing the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme are set out in Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994, a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered on a day-to-day basis by the Revenue Commissioners, who, under the regulations, may only consider an application for relief where a primary medical certificate has been issued to the person concerned by the senior area medical officer employed by the appropriate health board. This certificate confirms that the person fulfils the medical criteria laid down in the statutory instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confirm to the Deputy that neither my Department nor Revenue has any role in the medical assessment of the person nor in the issue of certificates. For this reason, it is not possible for me to supply a breakdown of the nature of the certificates issued and refused. However I have <Col N="410" /> received no evidence that there are health board areas where such certificates are particularly difficult to obtain. Therefore, it would appear that the medical criteria are generally applied in a consistent manner.</P>
    <P>The specified medical criteria refer essentially to particular types of physical disability, rather than to the underlying illness. The nature of the illness is not required to be stated on the primary medical certificate and for this reason, it is not possible to provide an analysis of the illnesses from which the successful applicants suffer.</P>
    <P>Where the issue of a primary medical certificate is refused, an appeal may be made to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. I understand that there is a long waiting list for assessment by the board. The number of persons who, while aware that they do not meet the medical criteria but nevertheless insist on being assessed by the board, may be a contributing factor to this waiting list.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the scheme is under review by an interdepartmental group under the chair of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Pending receipt of their report, I do not think that it is prudent for me to comment on the scheme in one way or another.</P>

      <P>I recently considered the matter and the present position is that last week I informed the Minister for Education and Science that, because of its scale, the project would need to be submitted to Government for decision. There have been no further developments of which I am aware since then.</P>

    <P>The Good Friday Agreement between the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland provides for the establishment of six North-South implementation bodies, including a food safety promotion board. Among the proposed functions of the FSPB are the surveillance of food-borne diseases, the promotion of scientific co-operation and links between laboratories and the development of cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing. The FSPB is to have a general remit to develop and sustain a strategy for the island of Ireland for the delivery of specialised <Col N="412" /> laboratory services. This includes conducting an early study of the relative cost-effectiveness of available options, preparing cost-effective proposals for submission to the North-South Ministerial Council and overseeing the implementation of the strategy once approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred in detail in the House to the publication of the report Towards a Standardised Framework on Inter-country Adoption Assessment. This report was commissioned in light of the huge increase in demand and resultant lengthy waiting times for assessment being experienced in all health board areas.</P>
      <P>The Government approved the publication of the report; the appointment of an implementation group to prioritise, plan and cost the phased implementation of the report's recommendations; and provided additional funding of £500,000 in 1999 to enable work to commence on implementation. This additional funding was allocated to health boards in respect of inter-country adoption assessment in 1999 on the basis of the waiting lists in December 1998.</P>
      <P>The implementation group has had three meetings to date and is updating the waiting list figures in each of the boards. The position in relation to the waiting lists for subsequent assessments will also be clarified. As soon as these figures become available I will have them forwarded to the Deputy. The work of the group includes prioritising training in the standardised framework through the provision of a seminar to all workers in ICA at the end of November; the commissioning of a detailed training manual for all stages of the framework, as well as back-up documentation for prospective adoptive parents.</P>
      <P>Based on the increase in staff assigned to assessment and the introduction of the standardised framework model, it is hoped that there will be a significant improvement in the number of assessments being completed in each of the boards during the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to increase the maintenance charges for private and semi-private care, the accident and <Col N="414" /> emergency charge and the in-patient charge. These increases, which will come into effect on 1 January 2000, were decided in the context of the Estimates.</P>
      <P>The charge in respect of private and semi-private rooms in public hospitals is being increased by 7%.  The new levels for 2000 are set out in the following table and will, as in previous years, be additional to the public hospital statutory in-patient charge. The in-patient charge is being increased by £1 to £26 per overnight or day case and the maximum payment in any 12 month period is being increased from £250 to £260. In addition, the accident and emergency charge is being increased by £5 to £25. This charge is levied only on persons who attend at accident and emergency departments without referral from their GP and is levied only for the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
      <P>The latter two public hospital statutory charges are based on the principle that those who can afford to do so are required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services. There are a number of exemptions to the charge, including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations. Also exempt from the statutory charges, in respect of treatment for the particular condition, are children suffering from prescribed diseases and disabilities, that is, mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy. Where the exemptions do not apply the charge may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>The rate of nursing home subvention and the threshold and assessment rules used in the means test for the payment of subvention are governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three maximum levels of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum. The funding provided for the scheme has increased from £17 million in 1996 to £33 million in 1999. This is due to the continuous increase in the number of people in receipt of subvention, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the maximum <Col N="415" /> rate of subvention, and other improvements in the scheme, for example, the removal of the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons and daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of a parent.</P>
    <P>As regards funding for the scheme in 2000, my priority is to ensure that health boards are provided with adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme and I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided, as part of the last budget, that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled.

      <P>As I explained in my reply to a question from Deputy Noonan on Thursday last, 11 November 1999, it is impossible at this stage to calculate the actual level of savings resulting from the recent nurses' strike since the strike itself gave rise to the health agencies incurring unscheduled but necessary expenditure in other areas, for example, payments for additional overtime worked by medical and other staff, in order to minimise the impact of the strike. These costs have to be set against the amount of nursing salaries unpaid during the strike. It remains my intention that any savings accruing will be used for patient care.</P>

      <P>The lack of medical note taking by consultant psychiatrists in St. James's Hospital was highlighted in the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals 1998 and was brought to the attention of the clinical director for that service.</P>
      <P>The guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in mental health services issued in 1998 recommended that there should be an agreed and fully documented admission policy and procedure in each service. In all ordinary circumstances admission decisions would preferably be made by a consultant psychiatrist. The guidelines also recommend that well planned discharge policies and procedures be in place. There should be a pre-discharge checklist to ensure that all appropriate information is given and all appropriate services are arranged prior to the patient's discharge.</P>
      <P>I understand that the inspector of mental hospitals noted during his most recent inspection of St. James's Hospital in 1999 that the medical note taking is now of a standard considered to be good professional practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, some of the information requested by the Deputy is not available in the format sought. The original non-capital expenditure provision for 1999 for the health services was some £3,508 million. Spending on the general hospital programme constituted £1,724 million or 49% of the total. In 1999, a total of £70.9 million was made available for service developments in the acute hospital services. Further funding was provided for pay increases, non-pay inflation and other cost increases. The Abridged Book of Estimates published last week sets out the funding available before the provision of any additional funding in the budget. These Estimates provide £69 million for service developments in the acute hospital sector. The scale of increased resources being provided by this Government will undoubtedly deliver major improvements in hospital services. The capital provision for hospital services alone under the national development plan will be of the order of £1 billion. This is an unprecedented level of investment and will transform the fabric of hospital infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
      <P>With regard to accident and emergency improvements, in 1997 £2 million was provided for the delivery of an accident and emergency plan in Dublin. In 1998, a further £2.5 million was made available to accident and emergency services nationally but concentrated particularly in the Dublin region. In the current year, a further £2 million was made available of which £1.65 million went to agencies in the Dublin region. The initiatives taken as a result of this funding include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. This has also allowed for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single biggest contributing factor to delays for patients in accident and emergency departments is the inability to secure acute hospital beds for patients who require admission from accident and emergency departments. There are in excess of 200 acute hospital beds inappropriately occupied at any given time in the Dublin area. This problem has occurred as acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient num<Col N="424" /> bers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital. The importance of this issue was confirmed in the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative. As I have stated on a number of occasions, I am committed to ensuring that the recommended approach in this report is speedily implemented.</P>
    <P>In particular, the report identified a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care. In an effort to address these problems, I provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, enable new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards.</P>
    <P>There are also patients, including the chronic sick and disabled, in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. Earlier this year, I asked the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the Dublin acute hospitals which provide accident and emergency services, to examine this particular aspect of the accident and emergency services and to formulate a response to the situation. I am pleased to say that the board has submitted a comprehensive action plan which takes into account this group of patients who need a mixture of sub-actute care services.</P>
    <P>I have already agreed to the implementation of the action plan which provides for an additional 235 alternative care places to cater for patients across the spectrum at a capital cost of £1 million and revenue cost of £438,000 in 1999. These 235 places can be broken down as follows; 70 sub-acute/convalescent places, 25 young chronic sick places, and 140 long stay contract nursing home places. These places are now coming on-stream and I am assured by the health board and Dublin hospitals involved in the plan that these additional places will significantly reduce the pressure on our accident and emergency services in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the major initiatives already under way will impact in a significantly positive manner in addressing the difficulties facing our accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am happy to announce that as a result of the revenue funding provided in last week's Estimates a further £5 million will be available next year to build on these initiatives and enhance significantly sub-acute services to continue to free up resources within hospitals for the <Col N="425" /> treatment of those requiring acute hospital treatment.</P>

      <Quest>the income thresholds, the maximum mortgage, the minimum mortgage percentage and the interest rate which apply in respect of the shared ownership scheme, the home improvement loan and the affordable housing scheme; the provision, if any, he has made in the recent Estimates for changes in these criteria; and the date on which the changes will come into force.</Quest>

      <P>The income thresholds in respect of the shared ownership scheme, the affordable housing scheme and the house improvement loan scheme are as follows: in the case of a single income household the gross income in the previous tax year must not exceed £20,000 and in the case of a two income household income eligibility is determined by a formula which takes account of the gross income in the preceding tax year of the principal earner and the subsidiary earner, that is, where two and a half times the income of the principal earner plus once the income of the subsidiary earner does not exceed £50,000, the household is eligible.</P>
      <P>There is no maximum loan limit set for the affordable housing scheme. However, the maximum loan cannot exceed 95% of the sale price of the house and account has to be taken of the purchaser's ability to repay by reference to net income of the household. In the case of the shared ownership scheme a borrower must purchase at least 40% of the value of the house and rent the remaining share &ndash; 60% or less &ndash; from the local authority. The maximum house improvement loans are: £15,000 &ndash; £20,000 on off-shore islands &ndash; where the loan is secured by a mortgage on the house, and £6,000 where the loan is not secured.</P>
      <P>The level of interest rates on local authority housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The level of interest charged on variable rate house purchase loans has recently been consolidated and a single rate is now applicable to all housing loans. The current rate is 3.85% with effect from 1 November 1999. The level of interest charged on fixed rate house purchase loans is currently 6.75% and is being reviewed by the Housing Finance Agency at present.</P>
      <P>Should any changes to these criteria prove necessary or appropriate adequate provision to fund such changes will be made.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. These measures, which were implemented between April and August this year, bring expenditure on the carer's allowance scheme in 1999 to almost £60 million which represents a 33% increase over the £45 million spent in 1998. This increase is reflected in the increasing numbers of carers in receipt of a carer's allowance which are up over 50%, from 9,200 when this Government took up office to 13,850 carers at the end of October this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the package of measures for carers introduced in last year's budget, the rate of the carer's allowance increased in June this year by £3 per week for recipients of the allowance who are under age 66 and by £6 per week for those who are over age 66. This represents an increase of 4.1% and 7.9% respectively on 1998 rates.</P>
      <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme, published recently.</P>

      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme, at a full year cost of around £475 million per annum. The last budget provided for increases in child benefit of £3 per month for each of the first two children in a family and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children <Col N="431" /> at a full-year cost of over £40 million. This brought the monthly rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46 respectively.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was originally awarded invalidity pension based on a combination of her Irish and United Kingdom social insurance contribution records. Regulations provide that an invalidity pension can only be paid on a combined Irish and UK record until such time as the person reaches UK retirement age which in this case is 60 years of age.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, with effect from 29 July 1999, she was no longer entitled to be paid full rate invalidity pension. She was, however, entitled to a <i>pro rata </i>pension at the rate of £55.30 per week. She may also be entitled to a UK retirement pension from age 60 and has been advised to apply for that pension. Her current entitlement to invalidity pension is based on her insurance record which shows a total of 46 reckonable contributions paid in 1980 and 1981. She has stated, however, that she was also employed between 1953 and 1973 but there is no social insurance record for her in respect of this period.</P>
      <P>In this regard, her case has been referred to a local investigator to try to establish details of any additional contributions that she may have paid in respect of her employments with these companies. There investigations are continuing and when they are completed, her entitlement to invalidity pension will be re-examined and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

Deputies will be aware that the European Commission must examine all schemes involving State aids to ensure that they are compatible with EU regulations relating to competitiveness etc. My Department's compensation scheme is currently being considered by the EU Commission and my officials are in constant touch with their counterparts in the commission. Once EU approval of the scheme has been secured payments can and will be made without delay.</P>

      <P>An Cnoc is the official Irish form of Knock, County Mayo, as established by order in Statutory Instrument No. 133 of 1975, An tOrdú Logainmneacha (Foirmeacha Gaeilge) (Uimhir 1)(Postbhailte) 1975. The official Irish form, An Cnoc, was proposed by the Placenames Commission on the basis of collected evidence for the name in 1958. This form was published provisionally in ainmneacha Gaeilge na mBailte Poist i gCúige Chonnacht, Liosta Sealadach (Oifig an tSoláthair 1960) and comment was invited. It was ratified by the commission and published in Ainmneacha Gaeilge na mBailte Poist (Oifig an tSoláthair 1969).</P>
      <P>The commission is composed of recognised scholars in the fields of Irish toponomy and related disciplines representing various areas of the country. When the Irish form of Knock was examined in 1958, the commission included several scholars who were personally well acquainted with the history and placenames of Connacht. In deciding on An Cnoc as the official form of the name, it is likely that the commission was influenced by the fact that this was the traditional form used by native Irish speakers in East Mayo at the beginning of this century and saw no reason to change it. It is my intention, however, in view of current common usage of the name Cnoc Mhuire to consult once again with the commission regarding this matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the EU habitats directive lists habitats and species for which special areas of conservation must be designated. The directive requires member states to contribute sites for these habitats and species, in proportion to their representation within the national territories. The selection of sites is based on the findings of ecological surveys. I regret that I am unable to provide the Deputy with a definitive response in this matter in the absence of a large scale map indicating the precise lands in question. If the Deputy can supply such a map to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, I will be glad to have the matter investigated further. Alternatively, I would be glad to arrange for an official of Dúchas to meet on site with the Deputy or a person nominated by her.</P>

      <P>The law already contains directions to the court on issues concerning the upbringing of a child where parents cannot agree on such matters.</P>
      <P>Policy in the law as it stands in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, is that the court must, in deciding matters relating to the custody of and access to children, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Subject to that important criterion, which is applicable in many other jurisdictions, the same Act empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning children and the court has powers to enforce any orders made.</P>
      <P>The Children Act 1997, inserted new provisions in the Act of 1964 to specify that the court has discretion whether or not to order joint custody. In the course of passage of the Bill, I strengthened its provisions in this area with a provision that the court, in making decisions in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. That provision was inspired by a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The court must also, under a provision inserted by the Act of 1997, consider the wishes of the child in suitable cases.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, in the best interests of all concerned when parents can agree the arrangements in relation to the custody of and access to their children, rather than have the courts decide the matter. Of importance in this context is that the Act of 1997 places a new emphasis on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms involving counselling and mediation and obliges solicitors acting for the parties to bring the possibilities offered by such procedures to the attention of their clients. It is well recognised that, where couples are separating, counselling and mediation can offer lasting effects which may benefit themselves and their children. The Government has allocated substantial extra funding for the development of counselling and mediation services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the reply to his Question No. 129 of 11 November 1999 by the Minister for Health and Children that in so far as claims against doctors are concerned the Minister hopes to bring forward proposals to make the handling of those particular claims more efficient.</P>
      <P>In so far as other changes of wider application than the medico-legal area are concerned, the Government's legislation programme, as announced by the chief whip on 27 September 1999, indicates that the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, to handle certain claims for compensation for personal injury against the State, is in the course of being drafted.</P>
      <P>Recent important changes in general procedural law have also been made which have a bearing on personal injury claims. Under powers given to the Superior Courts Rules Committee by the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995, changes were made in rules of court in 1997 to make provision regarding disclosure and admission of reports and statements. This procedure, properly availed of by parties, can make proceedings more efficient and cost effective. The rules committees of the various courts have, of course, general statutory powers which they exercise to make rules in relation to pleadings, practice and procedure which have a bearing on the way in which claims are processed in court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The details of any further changes in the law, taking into account, for example, any recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission, will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>It has been the long-standing policy of my Department to admit non-EU nationals to the State in order to study on condition that they are participating in a course of full-time private education at a recognised institution, that they are self-sufficient and that they do not take up employment while in the State. There is a certain amount of abuse of these arrangements, which is a source of concern, but on balance they work well and facilitate genuine students in obtaining further education as well as promoting cultural exchange between our country and others. The private education industry is also of course an important employer and generates significant export revenues.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, however, that to permit non-EU nationals, who have been granted permission to remain as students, to take up employment when they would not otherwise be entitled to do so without a work permit would distort the operation of these arrangements. There would be an unwelcome incentive for persons whose real objective is to access the labour market to enrol in a course or to prolong their attendance at a course, simply to be able to remain in employment here. It would be extremely expensive in terms of Garda resources, if not impossible, to police such arrangements with a view to ensuring that only genuine students were working.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware, however, that students are entitled to take up employment, whether paid or not, where such employment forms an integral part of a bona fide course of education, including professional education. Such arrangements are working well in a number of sectors and I would be happy to look into their application in other fields, if the Deputy has some in mind.</P>

      <P>Among the 14 project areas selected for inclusion in the pilot phase of the eight-15 year old early school leavers initiative, was the Lisduggan-Ballybeg area of Waterford City which involves three primary and two second level schools and other statutory and voluntary agencies. One of the key objectives of this initiative is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving with a view their replication, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>There are eight primary schools in County Waterford included in the disadvantaged areas scheme. By virtue of their inclusion in this scheme, they are also included in the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme operates at primary and second level and it focuses on schools involved in disadvantaged areas. Locally based co-ordinators work in selected areas in developing parental involvement in their children's education and fostering positive relationships between the parents and the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June this year I announced a major new stay <Col N="440" /> in school initiative. This will provide funding to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. My intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative will be multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools and agreed with my Department. This will provide for a range of targeted measures directed at the particular needs of the individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention.</P>
    <P>Two co-ordinators have been appointed to co-ordinate the initiative on a national basis, to assist schools in developing and implementing their plans and to liaise between schools and my Department. Fifty four post-primary schools have been invited to participate in the first phase of the project; this includes three schools in Waterford. At present my Department is awaiting responses from the schools who have been invited to participate. My Department will be in a position to identify participating schools as soon as these responses are received. It is expected that that further invitations will issue to schools to participate next year and again in 2001 and in 2002. The selection of schools for invitation to participate has been based on overall enrolment figures and the number of pupils failing to remain in school up to the completion of the senior cycle.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> The number of pupils taking Spanish in the leaving certificate applied has risen to over 500 in the past two years. Spanish is also taken by transition year students in about 80 schools.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted above for candidates in Spanish at the public examinations, 1999 represent 2.30% of the cohort at junior certificate level and 2.61% of the cohort at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, Spanish ranks as the second most popular of the languages on offer. It is provided by over 60% of second level schools &ndash; 150 out of 240.</P>
    <P>Spanish is at present spoken by an estimated 400,000,000 people in 21 countries across the world. This makes Spanish speakers the second largest language group after speakers of Chinese. English speakers are at present in third place.</P>
    <P>It should be stated that, from an education perspective, there are valid factors governing Department policy and subject choice in schools which have nothing to do with the size of the population which speaks a particular language. They include personal taste, proximity to the country in which the language is spoken, availability of teachers in a given school situation, third level study plans and plans to work abroad. Nevertheless, I am not satisfied with the current uptake of Spanish and am taking the following steps to address the matter.</P>
    <P>I have recently appointed an inspector of Spanish who has been in post since September 1999. Already, this single measure has had an empowering effect on the Spanish learning and teaching community.</P>
    <P>I have ensured that Spanish is represented in the modern languages in the primary school project. Spanish is at present taken by 53 of the 287 participating schools. The relatively modest number of schools involved masks the more relevant statistic that some of these are large schools where all pupils in 5th and 6th class are studying Spanish. When they proceed to second level, their numbers will create a new level of demand for the teaching of Spanish.</P>
    <P>I am planning an expansion of the primary languages project at present. One feature of this expansion will be an effort to address the problem of teacher supply in the lesser-taught languages. My Department is currently working on the details of this expansion.</P>
    <P>An initiative targeted specifically at increasing the uptake of Spanish and Italian and introducing Japanese will shortly get under way.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. Any proposal to move to a means assessment system based on net income would have significant financial implications, in addition to equity issues, which would have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> It has been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage of the previous year. I increased the reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year by 4.6%, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1997 to March 1998. I have also applied the increase in the reckonable income limits to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. The Deputy will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing demands in the education sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the student to whom the Deputy refers commenced a postgraduate course in November 1998 and applied to Wexford County Council for a higher education grant.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on 1 January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions. As the student in question was under 23 on 1 January in the year of entry to the course she could not be assessed as a mature student.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>Having been advised by Wexford County Council of her ineligibility to be assessed as an independent mature student she did not proceed with an application as a candidate dependent on parents in 1998-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> An application as an independent mature student was received from the candidate in 1999-2000. The county council processed the application without having noted that she was in the second year of her course. A grant was inadvertently awarded in September and the first payment made in mid-October. When this came to light in early November, the council wrote to the candidate advising her of their error and inviting her to apply as a dependent candidate which she has not done as of now. If she is not eligible for grant assistance, based on assessment of parental income, the council will seek to make a mutually convenient arrangement with the candidate to recoup the instalment of the grant which has been already paid.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties that the means assessment provisions of the higher education grants scheme can give rise to in individual cases such as this case and I have asked my Department to examine the issues concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach in relation to the value of higher education grants has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by <Col N="445" /> the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year. Provision has been made in the education Estimates for further indexation in this regard. Similarly in relation to the reckonable income limits, I have increased these limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. The reckonable income limits were increased by 4.6% for the 1999-2000 academic year based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1997 to March 1998. I have also applied the increase in the reckonable income limits to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160. I intend to follow this practice for the 2000 higher education grants scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, any improvements in the higher education grants scheme and the student support schemes generally must have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. I have previously indicated my intention to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants schemes before dealing with the more general issue of grant levels and income limits.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my priority has been to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. I have honoured that commitment and introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
      <P>I have also announced that, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. I was particularly concerned about mature students and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
