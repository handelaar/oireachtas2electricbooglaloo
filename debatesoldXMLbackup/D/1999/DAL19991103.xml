      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, in response to my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, the Taoiseach said there is no specific requirement for legislation on a single financial regulator. Yesterday at a committee of the House, staff from the Tánaiste's Department gave us a good briefing and clearly indicated legislation was being considered for the appointment of a single financial regulator, on a greenfield basis or using the Central Bank structures. Legislation is required. Will the Tánaiste explain exactly what is required in order to implement the McDowell report? Is she taking advice from the Attorney General on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said there is no specific requirement for legislation on this matter. The Tánaiste's staff gave a different view at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business yesterday. As the Tánaiste is taking the Order of Business, perhaps she will clarify the position of the single financial regulator.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the need for legislation only arises if we implement the McDowell report, either in full or in part. The Minister for Finance and I have had a number of discussions about this matter and we will shortly be bringing a memorandum to Government. Obviously there may well be a need for legislation in this area, it depends on the decisions we make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Government's position, or if the Tánaiste cannot tell me that, what is her position, on the promised legislation in respect of setting up a separate agency, outside the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to handle the administration of Feoga and other funding? I pose the question having regard to the ongoing disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money that is going on in that Department with the apparent knowledge and collusion of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to set up an independent agency to administer Feoga grants. The review of the programme for Government, which will be published today, reiterates that commitment. As the Taoiseach said yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will shortly be bringing a memorandum to Government &ndash; I understand before Christmas &ndash; on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A copy of the grouping of amendments will be provided to the Deputies.</P>
      <P>I will deal with amendment No. 1 and Opposition amendments Nos. 2, 23, 24 and 25 as they are related. On Committee Stage, Deputy Owen suggested that the Long Title was misleading to the extent that it did not reflect the fact that it was possible to offer a bond of £20,000 as an alternative to having a director resident in the State. The suggestion was made that a qualification such as &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; would alert parties to the alternative. Having looked at the matter in the meantime, I propose to insert the words &ldquo;save in certain circumstances&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;require&rdquo; in line 12. This is necessary as the bond is not the only alternative to the resident director. It is possible to be exempted all together from the requirement pursuant to section 44. I commend my proposal to the House.</P>
      <P>The issues arising in amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25 were discussed at length on Committee Stage. Concerns were expressed that we were allowing for the alternative of a bond at all. The point was made that if it was to be allowed, it should apply only in limited circumstances and that the amount should be increased from £20,000 to £40,000 or even higher. I will explain again why these amendments cannot be supported. First, for European Union Treaty reasons, we must have an alternative to the resident director. This is the legal advice we have received. The alternative chosen was a bond and, again for European Union Treaty reasons, this must be a real alternative and cannot be limited to certain circumstances as proposed in the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, regarding the size of the bond which must be put up, we must bear in mind that the provisions of the Bill will apply to all companies registered in Ireland. In pitching the bond at £20,000, we were conscious of the need not to impose an undue burden on reputable business concerns. This will be particularly important in <Col N="11" /> the case of a European Union resident who wishes to set up a company here but does not wish to use the Irish resident director route. If the bond is pitched too high, he or she would more easily be able to argue that it constituted an undue discrimination under the relevant treaty requirements governing freedom of establishment, etc.</P>
    <P>Third, in terms of addressing the IRNR problem, it is important to focus on the overall package of measures which have been carefully drawn up in assessing the effectiveness of the individual components of the package. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that the company law measures are designed to complement the considerable changes already effected in the taxation area and these will constitute a powerful weapon against abuse of Irish company structures for undesirable purposes in the future. In these circumstances I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25 tabled by Deputy Owen and I trust the House will understand the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for examining the matter further but I am still unsure that his suggestion is sufficiently frank and honest in relation to the legislation. I do not mean honest in a derogatory way but the Short Title of the Bill will mean nothing to somebody reading it. A lawyer will look at the Long Title and the explanation of the contents of the legislation, although there cannot be a long explanation for every section. It is obvious that, in moving to correct the position regarding Irish registered non-resident companies, sections 43 and 44 are extremely important elements of the Bill. For the first time the requirement to have an Irish director of such companies is being brought into law to try to prevent false companies being established.</P>
      <P>Allied to the obligation on the company to appoint an Irish director is a cut off that one can lodge a bond. It may be the case, as the Minister of State said, that section 44 is a way of getting around the need to appoint an Irish director or to have a bond. However, when one considers section 44, it is obvious that the certificate from the Registrar of Companies can only be given if he or she is satisfied that the company is carrying on business. In my view, one of the ways a company will satisfy the Registrar of Companies will be to show that an Irish person is involved. When it comes to the assessment of a company which is seeking a certificate as opposed to fulfilling the obligations under the previous section, one of the measures of assessment will be the existence of an Irish director. I am not satisfied that the Minister of State's suggestion of &ldquo;save in certain circumstances&rdquo; will be sufficient to flag the fact that many companies will use the bond method rather than the company director route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that despite the changes in the Finance Act in relation to Irish registered non-resident companies, ingenious and clever people are finding ways <Col N="12" /> around the legislation already. There was a recent article in the monthly magazine <i>Finance Dublin</i>&ndash; I am sure the Minister of State has a copy of it &ndash; and I would be interested in his comments on the allegations in it. Unfortunately, I did not have time to find the magazine before I came to the House but my recollection is that the article alleged that people are finding ways of appointing agents which overcomes the need to comply with the changes already made in the Finance Act. This will thwart the Minister of State's intentions in this Bill when it is enacted. I am unhappy with his proposal.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for much, only for the words &ldquo;or to lodge a bond&rdquo; to be included. Perhaps the Minister of State's proposal, &ldquo;save in certain circumstances&rdquo;, could also be included. It could be a belt and braces exercise. I do not understand why he cannot amend the Long Title to state &ldquo;a person resident in the State or to lodge a bond&rdquo; because that is the main choice being offered in this menu of activities for Irish registered non-resident companies. I am satisfied that, although belatedly, he has taken on board the concerns expressed by the Association of Company Registration Agents. I wonder why it came so late to the debate &ndash; perhaps the Department was unaware of its existence. The association made the point the Minister of State has now recognised regarding the Treaty of Rome that there may be a constitutional challenge to the legislation. The Minister of State did not use that argument when I questioned the choice of a bond. I believe it should always be an Irish resident director. I am surprised the Minister of State did not allude to the Treaty of Rome. He may have done but if so, I did not hear him because the debate was so complicated. The Irish association of company registration agents is very concerned about a ruling recently handed down by the European Court of Justice in the Centros case, which highlights the inherent risks for a member state in imposing restrictive corporate regulations intended for application on all member states. The association states:</P>
    <P>This ruling effectively means that an Irish business could be registered in the UK with a branch being set up in Ireland resulting in much less disclosure and control within the Irish jurisdiction, which is a possibility if we provide a very restricted choice of corporate structure within our State.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the association chairman has prepared a paper highlighting the effects and inherent risks of sections 42, 43 and 45 <i>vis-à-vis </i>the European legislation. I hope the Minister's Department has looked carefully at the Centros case to ensure it does not have implications and that this legislation will not be subject to a constitutional challenge once enacted. As an Opposition Deputy I do not have the wherewithal to examine the implications of that case. I hope the Department has.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State agree that amend<Col N="13" /> ments Nos. 1 and 2 are justifiable in these circumstances? Perhaps he may show an expansion of mind and accept amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Owen's request that the adviser look at the Long Title, the wording we propose will alert the reader to see what is meant by &ldquo;certain circumstances&rdquo;. We are, therefore, satisfied that the amendment is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to an article published in the August edition of the magazine <i>Finance Dublin,</i> published by the IFSC on a monthly basis.

      <P>Deputy Owen referred to the EU treaty and the constitutional position. In all of my responses, on Committee Stage and elsewhere, I said that we must keep on-side with regard to European treaty obligations. The wording I propose to include in the Title conforms with that position. The advice of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman is in tune with that and I am obliged to accept the excellent legal advice available to me. I am advised that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;save in certain circumstances&rdquo; is the only way we can conform with the treaty. I have gone as far as I can to assist the Deputy with her request on Committee Stage and, in so far as I can from a legal point of view, I now propose to amend the Title to take account of her points.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the decision of the European Court of Justice on the Centros case. The court made its decision last March. Essentially the case involved a Danish couple residing in Denmark who in 1992 purchased a limited liability company, Centros, which was incorporated in England. The Danish couple then used this company to conduct business in Denmark. Under European law it is possible for the activity of a company to be carried on in another member state through a branch. Where this is done certain registration and ongoing funding procedures have to be fulfilled in respect of the branch.</P>
      <P>However, the Danish authorities refused to register the branch, primarily because it understood the branch was being used as a device by the Danish nationals to get around the requirement of Danish law whereby if they had established the company in Denmark they would have had to provide a minimum share capital of 200,000 Danish kroners. Essentially the court of justice held that the Danish authorities were not entitled to refuse to register the branch and that under the relevant articles under the Treaty of Rome, the Danish nationals were entitled to use the incorporation process as they had done.</P>
      <P>In developing the IRNR proposals, the office of the Attorney General was consulted at all times. This was particularly so to ensure account was taken of Article 52, dealing with the freedom of establishment; Article 53, which prohibits the introduction of new restrictions; Article 56, which permits exemptions on public policy grounds, provided the action is proportional and no other effective remedy is available; Article 48, which deals with free movement of workers; and Article 59, which deals with freedom to provide services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package of company law measures, which were designed to complement the taxation measures, were designed with the European Treaty requirements in mind. The requirement that every company must engage in an activity is seen as evidence that the State is taking measures to resolve the problem. The requirement that <Col N="15" /> every company must have an Irish resident director has a number of alternatives, including the availability of a bond for £20,000 or the certificate under section 44, where a company can demonstrate to the Revenue authorities that it has a continuous link with the State. That covers the options set out in the words &ldquo;save in certain circumstances&rdquo;. By amending the Title we believe we are meeting all our legal and European requirements and are going as far as we can to meet the requirements sought by the Deputy on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 23 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Companies Acts, 1963 to 1986, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, the Companies Act, 1990, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999, and this Act (other than <i>section 40</i>) may be cited together as the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999.</P>
      <P>(3) The enactments referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> shall be construed together as one.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I introduced a technical amendment to the collective citation of the Companies Acts required by the fact that the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, dealing with stabilisation, had been enacted since this Bill was published. In the course of that debate Deputy Rabbitte raised a point regarding the collective citation, pointing out that it did not refer to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990. I understand that the lack of a reference in the second Companies Act, 1990, to the earlier one does not present any legal difficulties because of the wording of the collective citation in both Companies Acts enacted in 1990. Nevertheless, I have decided to take this opportunity to regularise the matter and to avoid any confusion in the future.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 14, to delete &ldquo;, not exceeding 10 days,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, I will refer to amendments Nos. 4 and 7. Section 9 specifies that interim protection may be provided to a company for a period not exceeding ten days to allow the independent accountant's report to be drawn up. As stated in the new subsection 3A (1), it is intended that interim protection will be available for a limited timeframe in exceptional circumstances solely for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that when the ten day time limit expires on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, I would consider whether the deadline should be extended to the next working day. The two Government amendments to section 9 3A (1) and the insertion of a new subsection 3A (2) would provide for this. I hope Deputy Owen will appreciate that I have gone some way towards meeting her concerns in relation to this section by tabling the two Government amendments. I am not prepared to accept her two amendments to section 9 which have been retabled on this Stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 5, I already outlined on Committee Stage that in section 4(2) of the Companies Act, 1990, provision is made to discount a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday only where the period in question is six days or less. I am not aware of any compelling reason why interim examinership should deviate from this general provision in company law. Therefore, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen's second amendment to section 9 would allow the court discretion to extend the period of interim examinership beyond ten days. Interim examinership is meant to apply in exceptional circumstances and for a limited timeframe. This would clearly no longer be the case if the court could extend the period of interim examinership on a case by case basis. Once the independent accountant's report is presented to the court within the ten day period, the company will be under the protection of the court, even if the court is not in a position to hear the petition for a number of days. I trust this clarifies the position, but I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State. I went through the report of the Committee Stage debate and marked where the Minister said he would come back to us on Report Stage. This is one area where he said he would keep the law under review and re-examine the section. While he has moved, I still have concerns. He is saying that if the ten day period ends on a Saturday, Sunday or on a bank holiday Monday, he will allow it to be extended to the Tuesday. For many people, Saturdays and Sundays are not working days, but others, such as politicians, work on Sat<Col N="17" /> urdays, Sundays and on bank holidays. I am disappointed the Minister of State could not take that extra step and state the ten days would be ten normal working days. I welcome his comments about what will happen if the tenth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday because if the process started on a Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, a Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday might occur in the middle of the ten day period and the tenth day would end in the middle of the following week. In some instances there might be just seven working days and in others there could be ten, but only seven of them might be working days. I am disappointed the Minister of State has not gone further. However, I welcome the fact that he listened to what I said and made some moves in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said one would be under the protection of the courts. We already discussed the meaning and implication of this for a person looking at a company. The Minister of State said that once the auditor's report is before the court, the company is then under the protection of the court. Will this be the case even if the ten day period has expired?</P>

      <P>We are talking about a serious crisis where a company is going into examinership. I do not believe it matters whether it is Saturday, Sunday or Monday because if professionals are working to save the company, they will work all the hours God can give them to do the job right. I am sure this is the norm. They will be given ten days to lodge their documentation with the court. The Bill proposes that once the documentation is lodged with the court within the ten day period, a decision is automatically made that a statement has been made that the company needs to be under examination. Under the proposal in the Bill, once the documents have been lodged within the ten days, the company will be under the protection of the court.</P>

      <P>Section 9(b) states, &ldquo;.accordingly, the court is unable to consider the making of an order under that section, the court may make an order under this section placing the company concerned under the protection of the court for such period, not exceeding 10 days, as the court thinks appropriate.&rdquo;. The placing of the order and the company under the protection of the court still <Col N="18" /> seems to be wrapped up in this ten day period, notwithstanding the slight amendment to it. The Minister of State is saying that if the report is lodged but the court is not in a position to make a decision on it, the company is still under the protection of the court even though the order might not be made. Is the court still obliged to make the order within that ten day period?</P>

We are saying that once the independent accountant's report is lodged in the court, that makes a statement that the company must be put under the protection of the court. The proposal in the Bill allows the court to protect that company. The court will then decide when it will hear the case and make an order pertaining to the statement and the documentation lodged. The company is automatically placed under the protection of the court once the documents are lodged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point trying to elicit a response from the Minister of State unless he can reply. In addition to what Deputy Owen said, will the Minister of State address discussions he has had with the consultative committee of the <Col N="19" /> accountancy bodies of Ireland? I understand that it put to him or his officials that it would have been better if this amendment specifically provided that a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday falling within that ten day period should be excluded from the calculation. It is a neater formulation and I am curious as to the Minister of State's response. I cannot see why that formulation would be opposed. It appears to be a neater drafting than the amendment.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State also address the concern raised in respect of what is called in the jargon a section 3 report, the detailed report one receives from the independent accountant which accompanies the petition in circumstances such as those to which we refer? Will he address the specific fear raised that this could have the undesirable impact that, by the time the necessary information is put together, the opportunity for examination may have passed and the company may be beyond having a reasonable prospect of survival?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point made by Deputy Rabbitte is appropriate. A reasonable prospect of survival is the purpose of examination. If we allow a long time period for the examination process to commence, the chances for the survival of the company could be less than if there is immediate action. Normally a week is accepted as a reasonable period in which to apply for examinership, produce the reports, appraise the situation and lodge the documentation with the court. We had discussions with the accountancy bodies on this matter and they wanted ten working days but we were not prepared to accept that. We are prepared to allow ten days &ndash; seven working days and three other days &ndash; in which documentation can be lodged. We deem that fair.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a crisis situation which warrants immediate serious action and responses. We have allowed ten days to lodge the documentation with the court. It is still a matter for the court to take a decision and make an order. There are many options available to directors and creditors of companies and others. The longer the period allowed, the more options are available. If people take legal action to protect themselves, for example, it could jeopardise the equality of opportunity available to others who are also victims of the company's crisis. By keeping the timeframe tight, that equality is maintained by ensuring that everyone receives the same treatment within the law and receives the same protection from the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company law review group recommended the changes we are implementing. We are responding to the group's requests and recommendations, we are taking into account all that has been said to us by the various professional bodies and I have taken into account the request made by Deputies Owen and Rabbitte in the amendments to which I am responding. In so far as it is possible, I will accommodate them. We <Col N="20" /> must realise that we are talking about an urgent or crisis situation and the timeframe must be tight to reflect that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;3B. (1) The court shall not accept a petition presented under section 2 or an order appointing an examiner to a company unless the creditors by a majority of two-thirds have agreed to allow such a petition to be made to the courts.</P>
      <P>(2) The court shall not make an order dismissing a petition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and move it again here. I do not wish to delay matters as the Minister of State responded on the previous occasion. Has he reconsidered the IBEC and accountancy consultative committee suggestion that there should be more power for creditors in the acceptance of a petition by the courts? I recognise that the Bill in section 10 has gone some way towards allowing creditors to be heard, but there is still a concern that the law does not go far enough to give them a chance to have a say. Did the Minister of State reconsider that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reconsidered every request made <Col N="21" /> to me, including reconsidering the Bill with an excellent team of officials who consulted with great diligence with the Attorney General and his team and the parliamentary draftsman to ensure we get right one of the most serious Bills to be enacted pertaining to company law.</P>
      <P>I outlined on Committee Stage the reasons I was not prepared to accept this amendment. The new subsection 3B(1) is designed to afford each creditor the right to heard during the hearing concerning the petition for the appointment of an examiner by the court, something which is not provided for in existing legislation. I agree that creditors should have the right to be heard at the petition hearing as their views would assist the court in deciding whether there is a reasonable prospect of survival for the company. This may mean in practice that the court would not grant protection to a company if its creditors are opposed to such a course of action. Therefore, I consider that the reasonable prospect criteria, giving creditors, including small ones, the right to be heard at the hearing for the appointment of an examiner and that ultimately at least one class of creditors will have to approve the scheme of arrangement, are sufficient safeguards to the interests of all creditors. However, a balance needs to be struck between the rights of the creditors and other interested parties. I do not accept that creditors, especially larger ones, should be allowed to frustrate the process from the outset, which is what could result from this amendment. Therefore, I regret I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that, for the first time, creditors can be heard in a court. Our difficulty, and my colleague, Deputy Perry, highlighted this, is that while it affords a hearing for each creditor of a company who has indicated as much to the court, there could be creditors who would not know to indicate to the court their desire to be heard. I recognise that petitioners are obliged to ensure the proposal is placed in newspapers specifying the date on which the hearing is to be held arising out of a report prepared. However, if I am right, those notices appear somewhere on the second last page and on the same page as or the page before the death notices in most newspapers. I do not know many people who automatically turn to that section of a newspaper. The only time I tend to read those notices is if my paper happens to be folded on that page and I pick it up and, out of interest, read the court notices. It is not regular reading. It is not the page most people turn to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that, if one is a creditor of a company and one hears a rumour the company is in trouble, one keeps an eye out for these notices. <Col N="22" /> However, sometimes creditors can be small operators. It might be a man supplying bread or some other product to a company which is owed a lot of money. I wonder what the chances are of such a person turning to the relevant page in the newspaper. I hope the Minister will keep the section under review to ensure that the spirit of what he is doing in section 10, namely, to give creditors a chance to have their views heard before a company is wound up or put under the protection of the court, which will perhaps ultimately prevent them getting paid, will be upheld. I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to give me a commitment that he will keep this section under review to ensure it does what is intended.</P>

However, we could not get into a situation where all creditors would have to be notified in advance of a decision being made. Obviously, notices will be published in newspapers. At the end of the day, if any creditor is not included in an accounting statement or is not aware of a decision of the court, he or she has every right to go into the court to make the case at any time during the examinership. There is no way people can be excluded. The Deputy can be absolutely certain that we want this to work and will keep it under review.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 12 of the Act of 1990 is hereby further amended by the substitution for subsection (4) of the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Where a company is, by virtue of section 5, deemed to be under the protection of the court, every invoice, order for goods or business letter issued by or on behalf of the company, being a document on or in which the name of the company <Col N="23" /> appears, shall, immediately after the mention of that name, include the words &ldquo;in examination (under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990)&rdquo;.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 12(4) of the 1990 Act requires that the statement &ldquo;under the protection of the court&rdquo; is stated on documents issued by the company following the appointment of the examiner. On Committee Stage, Deputy Owen raised the point that the existing wording &ldquo;under the protection of the court&rdquo; might be misleading to some creditors of companies in examinership and proposed that the alternative wording &ldquo;in examination&rdquo; be used. Following from the Committee Stage discussion and consultation with the draftsman's office, I am now proposing a Government amendment similar to Deputy Owen's proposal. The addition of a reference to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, is intended to make it absolutely clear what type of examination is referred to.

    <P>The House will recall that on Committee Stage, a new subsection 4<i>(a)</i> was inserted into section 24 of the original Act of 1990. This new subsection was designed to ensure that any scheme of arrangement put together by an examiner in a group could not deplete the assets of one company in a group to the detriment of its creditors, to benefit the members or creditors of another <Col N="24" /> related company or the main company. During the discussion on Committee Stage a number of Deputies indicated that the original wording of the new subsection 4<i>(a)</i> was confusing and difficult to understand. I undertook to ask the draftsman to have another look at the text. I am now proposing to delete the term &ldquo;the company or, as the case may be, each company&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any company&rdquo;.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 1 to 48.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this matter and greatly regret that the Minister has not seen his way to taking on board the thrust of the Committee Stage debate. He has made the situation worse. This matter is so serious that it threatens the entire concept of examinership. Examinership is a valuable instrument, one which, by and large, we have seen function successfully in a number of cases. Now that the Minister has changed the test to one of a reasonable prospect of survival, it is more likely that examinership could be a very useful instrument for a company which, for exceptional reasons, finds itself in difficulty. If given the protection of the court for a period, such a company could well turn the corner and be restored to prosperity.</P>
      <P>My amendment, if accepted, would result in the deletion of lines 1 to 48. The Minister is essentially inserting a special provision for major banking institutions and finance houses, something which has been the subject of intense lobbying by the banks. The Minister is effectively making an exception in the case of the banks. Section 24(4)<i>(c)</i>(ii) of the 1990 Act states that the court shall not confirm any proposals unless it is satisfied that the proposal is not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party. What is wrong with that provision in the 1990 Act whereby the court is required to be satisfied that the proposal is not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party, including the banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister goes out of his way to say that that section of the 1990 Act does not apply if the proposals contain a provision relating to a lease of, or any hiring agreement in relation to, property other than land and, in the opinion of the court, the value of the property is substantial and the said provision is of like effect to a provision referred to in paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> in subsection 1. He then goes on to effectively delete sub<Col N="25" /> section 3<i>(b)</i>. Subsection 3 states that in deciding, for the purposes of subsection 2, whether the value of the property concerned is substantial, the matters to which the court shall have regard &ldquo;shall include .&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;shall include&rdquo; gave the court guidance in terms of what might be considered to be substantial. That guidance has now been removed so that there is no longer proportionality. &ldquo;Substantial&rdquo; will effectively now be in the minds of the banks.</P>
    <P>At least previously in subsection 3(b) regard had to be had not just to the length of the unexpired lease, but to the extent to which the owner of the property concerned carries on any business of leasing or hiring property and the proportion, in general terms, which the value of the property concerned bears to the value of the total amount of property which, in the opinion of the court, is likely to be leased or hired by that person at any particular time. So, there was a question of proportionality and that had to be taken into account. Now, one could have a situation where a major plant hire firm engaged in business and, for whatever reason &ndash; it would not be without precedent &ndash;  runs into temporary difficulty and everybody considers it has a reasonable prospect of survival and, in terms of trying to do the workout, the bank comes in at the last minute and says: &ldquo;That is fine. You can work out your comprise or scheme of arrangement and so on, but we are taking back the plant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Acting Chairman will know that nowadays this is down to the provision of computer hardware. I know of several companies where it is by lease arrangement. There are many other reasons for this into which we are not going in terms of tax efficiency or even tax breaks and so on. A major plant hire company could be in exactly the situation I suggest &ndash; that the actual machinery which does the work is leased from the bank and that we all agree that plant hire company has a reasonable prospect of surviving for a number of reasons but the bank is not convinced and says: &ldquo;Yes, that is grand. We will go along with that, but we will take back the machinery in the morning&rdquo;. That means the wherewithal for the company to do its business is gone.</P>
    <P>I gave the example on the last occasion that if one had a shipping company and one's vessel, which transports people or cargo, is under a big ticket leasing arrangement, the same thing can happen. Others may be persuaded that it has a reasonable prospect of survival but the bank can intervene and say it is taking back its asset, which is not land but other property. That greatly diminishes the value of examinership.</P>
    <P>I will make a point about the invidious discrimination involved here as between categories of creditor. How is it that everybody else by definition almost is expected to take something of a hit? There may be many creditors to that plant hire company or to that shipping company. The shipping company may have a catering contractor supplying goods and services, it may have petrol supplies and so on. It may well be asked, <Col N="26" /> as a result of the workout, to say one must accept 90p in the pound or whatever. The workers may be called in and their union may be told they have to take a £10 per week cut in pay until the company comes out of this difficult period or else they will have to forego the next phase of Partnership 2000 or whatever it is.</P>
    <P>Almost by definition, examinership means that creditors are prepared to experience some pain, otherwise the whole exercise would not be feasible. Maybe when things get better, they will more than recoup it in terms of enhanced business. Almost by definition, the assumption is that they may take some grief but not the banks &ndash; the financial institutions involved in this big ticket leasing. All they have to decree is that it is substantial. The more substantial, I suggest, the more terminally devastating it will be for the company making application for examinership.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue the last day and would like to hear the Minister speak specifically on it. I am advised that constitutionally one may not make this type of invidious discrimination as between categories of creditor. I would like to hear the Minister speak on what is the constitutional basis on which he is assured that this irrational invidious discrimination as between categories of creditor is constitutionally firm. I instanced the Blaskets case purely because it was topical at the time. The net point was that one could not engage in invidious discrimination as between categories of landowner on the Blasket Islands. How is it that we can import a provision here which seems to be at least as irrationally invidious as that because it seems to be for no other purpose than to accede to the special pleading of the banks? </P>
    <P>The Minister will plead the origins of this are in the Company Law Review Group report. The Company Law Review Group was made up of eminent persons and if one looks and traces the history of it, its deliberations and the report, there was a very single-minded mission on behalf of certain people to achieve this very purpose. It was perfectly legitimate, and the Minister should not frown at me. They were perfectly legitimate to argue that case. I am not disputing the legitimacy of the advocacy but I know about it because I was subjected to representations on it. I know they had a single-minded purpose to achieve the exemption of the banks above all else.</P>
    <P>One could say that the first time we used this instrument was in August 1990 in the Goodman case. One could plausibly argue that Goodman would not have been rescued if this amendment had been law at the time. God knows, my views on Goodman's outfit are well known but I would not and did not vote, notwithstanding the strong feelings I had about many others things in the manner of the conduct of the group of companies, to put the company out of business. Again, it is a balance in terms of the public good. Whatever the company was or was not up to, many people were employed there and they should be maintained in employment. The banks took a hell of a hit there, and the Minister knows that as well as I do and <Col N="27" /> so do his advisers. The banks came out of the Goodman examinership very badly. Goodman came out of it very well and is back in control of the company but at a cost to a large number of banks involved. Subsequent to that, one had the Kents affair. In the Kents case, which ultimately went to the Supreme Court, it can be logically argued that again the banks took a hit. There was a definite motivation for the lobbying which took place and which is now seeing expression in this proposal from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have not intervened unduly in this debate but this issue is so important that it will greatly diminish &ndash; not to exaggerate it &ndash; the value of examinership because after all, in the future, a major company which is a large employer will face temporary difficulties and examinership may well give it the prospect of real survival and the court could go ahead and sanction the workout. However, if the lessor, the hirer company &ndash; the banks, in short &ndash; comes in and says it wants its asset back, it can get its asset back under this proposal from the Minister of State. That is a great shame.</P>
    <P>Where does the Minister of State stand on the discretion of the court? Does he not think that given the changes he has now made in the law regarding examinership &ndash; and I suggest they are improvements &ndash; the value of the independent accountant's report and so on, that the court will be seized of the information necessary to make a reasonable, balanced decision on whether the court should sanction the application? I believe the court will have that information and ought to be permitted to use its discretion. I am extremely concerned that other creditors such as small supply companies &ndash; some of which, incidentally, will be of no commercial significance in the context of financial institutions  &ndash; will be expected to take pain, but the financial institution is exempt. That is wrong and it is a capitulation to special pleading.</P>
    <P>I know the view in the Minister of State's Department. The reason this legislation has not been brought forward before now is that when I was in his position I could not, in conscience, agree to it. I am not implying any moral judgment on the fact that he has, because he is entitled to make a different judgment, but I believe it is a wrong judgment that greatly circumscribes the effect this law will have in the future. I greatly regret the Minister of State did not take on board any points from our previous debate. What we have now removes the guidance in the originally published Bill regarding what the court is supposed to take into account regarding the definition of &ldquo;substantial.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I, like Deputy Rabbitte, am very disappointed. The debate on Committee Stage on this section takes up many pages in the Official Report and several Deputies pressed the Minister of State on this matter. On Committee Stage the Minister of State fell back on part 237 of the <Col N="28" /> Company Law Review Group's report in 1994. Let us face it, that is five years old and it behoved the Minister of State in producing this legislation five years later, to take into consideration all that has happened since. In many cases it has been and the Minister of State was open enough to make amendments based on the Company Law Review Group's report; for example, the Minister of State raised the figures in relation to the value of a company that does not have to do audits according to the report's suggestions.</P>
      <P>However, on Committee Stage we said that if a company was to be saved and put into a position where it is under the protection of the court and there is a likelihood that the company may be saved, all the creditors may have to take a hit. There should not be preferential treatment for one category of creditor over another. If a man or woman provides a service or sells property to a company under examinership and has to take a hit, then all the assets that are part of what made the company viable or threatens its viability have to be taken into account. If paying rent is part of what is threatening the company, then everybody, including the company which owns the building and receiving the rent, must take the same hit.</P>
      <P>As originally framed, the legislation was giving preferential treatment. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Minister of State has now put a belt and braces in on behalf of the banks and the big lease companies by including amendment No. 17, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Subsection (1) or (2) shall not apply if the lessor or owner of the property concerned has consented in writing to the inclusion of the provision referred to in subsection . in the proposals for the compromise or scheme of arrangement.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Minister of State is giving them a choice and is taking away the discretion of the courts. On Committee Stage I said that my understanding was that a scheme could be formulated by the examiner and be accepted. I thought that would include a reduction in rent to allow the company to have more liquid assets to make it viable. However, the amendment states that no scheme can then allow for a further loss or rent or property value. The reply was that one could not build into the agreement a loss of value further into the future, so the Minister of State has not answered our Committee Stage concerns with these amendments. He said he would consider the matter carefully, but he has not answered our concerns. It appears that the banks can come in and literally take the feet out from under the possible future viability of a company. The asset needed to make a company work may be the building in which the business is being run, as is the case with companies using computers, but if that is not taken into consideration or if the bank says it will not reduce the rent as it can put in another tenant to pay the rent being forgone by the company's difficulties, the examinership process is then utterly futile and has no basis. <Col N="29" /> What can a company do if it has no place in which to operate?</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister of State has continued to base his own argument on the Company Law Review Group report. The last line states that the lessor shall have the option to repossess the asset if the company cannot meet its obligation after the protection period. That means that almost from the beginning the bank can pull down the shutters and say: &ldquo;Get lost. We are taking back our asset. We will not enter into any discussion.&rdquo;  That is blatantly unfair and sets the whole process at naught. I hope the Minister of State will reconsider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall we had a long debate on Committee Stage on this section and I undertook to look at this in advance of Report Stage. It would be useful to outline the purpose of this section and the reason I do not accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment. In existing legislation, the position of lessors in relation to future payments due after the examination period has come to a close and the scheme of arrangement has been put in place is somewhat unclear. The Company Law Review Group considered it unreasonable to require a lessor of an asset, such as an office block, to be required by an examiner's scheme of arrangement to accept reduced payments for a future period. Section 26 is designed to preclude this situation. It would be useful if I gave an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A company in difficulty has a 20 year lease on an office block, paying rent of £10,000 per annum. The company is in the fifth year of the lease but is in arrears with the rent due to difficulties in which it has found itself, owing the landlord £5,000 in rent arrears. An examiner is appointed to the company and draws up a scheme of arrangement for the return of the ailing company to viability. Under the scheme of arrangement drawn up by the examiner and ultimately approved by the court, each creditor will receive 50p for every £1 owed to him. This means the lessor, based on a phased basis, will probably received £2,500 of the back rent owed to him or her. He or she, along with other creditors, will have to write off the remaining amount owed by the company. Essentially, section 26 determines what cannot be included in the scheme of arrangement. In this example it means that subject to what is proposed in amendment No. 17, nothing in the scheme of arrangement can make the landlord accept reduced rents in the future and the company will have to honour the terms of the lease for the remaining 15 years. Otherwise the lessor would be subsidising the operations of the company. This would be unfair both to the lessor and the competitors of the company across the country and across Europe. The company will therefore have to pay £10,000 per annum for the remaining 15 years left to run on the lease. This is the economic rent for the property in question. This is putting lessors on the same footing as other credi<Col N="30" /> tors, none of whom is expected to accept reduced payment for goods supplied after the examinership process has come to an end and once the company has been restored to health.</P>
    <P>All creditors, be they banks, landlords or suppliers of goods and services, will have to take the same treatment on pre-petition debts and the courts will adjudicate thereon. There is no exemption from that for anybody &ndash; everybody will be treated the same. They will all have to take the same hit on pre-petition debts. We are dealing here with the position post-examinership. We cannot expect a landlord or an investor in a fixed asset which is providing a facility to a company to continue to take a hit <i>ad infinitum</i> into the future, subsidising that company in its operations to the detriment of competitors and other companies. This would not stand up in European or Irish law.</P>
    <P>Personally I have not received as much as one representation from a bank or institution and have received no telephone call or documentation on this matter. I have asked my officials and they have had no meetings with institutions &ndash; banks or otherwise &ndash; on this matter. Certainly they have received submissions from a number of institutions, but they have not had any meetings with them. I have not been under any personal pressure on this matter and have no difficulty whatever in relation to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised the point that this section could mean that a lessor could repossess a substantial asset from a company thereby preventing that company from continuing to trade and preventing a scheme of arrangement being put in place. If a company is not in a position to honour the terms of a lease and pay the pre-agreed rent for a substantial property once the examinership period has come to a close, the lessor cannot be made by the examiner's scheme of arrangement to accept a reduced rent for that asset. This may mean that if the company begins to default on its payments after the examinership has come to an end and benefit is in accordance with the lease, the lessor could repossess the asset. That is normal in any property, leasing or letting transaction.</P>
    <P>The basic question is why should a lessor be forced to subsidise the ongoing operation of a company which is unable to pay its debts. Post-examinership, other creditors are not forced to accept reduced payments for their goods or services from a company just because it was once in examinership. Indeed creditors who had to accept a write-down during an examinership in respect of money owed to them might decide not to do business with that company again, as is their right. A lessor does not have the same level of flexibility. He must honour the terms of the lease which could be for 11, 20 or 33 years. He is obliged to honour the lease with the company. All this section is doing is ensuring that post-examinership a company, unless the lessor agrees otherwise &ndash; a very important point as we are not taking away the right of the lessor to reach a new <Col N="31" /> agreement with the company &ndash; must also do so. I think this is fair and equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the issue of representations, I do not think very much hinges on it. We all get representations. The Minister has responded as if I was imputing improper motives. I am not doing so at all. I do not know whether the Minister received representations. It is very odd if he did not because when I was Minister I received representations on behalf of the financial institutions on this point. I also received representations concerning the importance of this from persons on the company law review group. Perhaps we have two different styles. However, this is not the central point and I am not making a big issue of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's entire response hinges on his original statement that the position of lessors is unclear as the law stands in respect of the post-examinership position. He then goes on to construct a basis for this entire change in the law on the basis that existing law is unclear. I do not accept for one minute that existing law is unclear. Neither do I accept that post-examinership the necessary consequences to which the Minister <Col N="32" /> referred will happen. During the course of the examinership I would make no apologies for a situation where the lessor would be required to take the same proportionate hit as other creditors.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. Existing law does not require any such change in my opinion. The court ought to have discretion to make this judgment and the banks or the lessor &ndash; it is usually banks which are behind the lessor irrespective of who he is &ndash; ought to be able to make their case to the court and have it considered like anybody else. Let them make their case. I do not accept that if we did not do this the lessor would be caught in a situation of accepting diminished rent for the remaining life of the contract.</P>

      <P>I moved a similar amendment on Committee Stage because the Minister of State accepted the spirit of another amendment I tabled on the turnover of a company. He indicated his support as long as it did not exceed £100,000, which is in line with a recommendation in the Company Law Review Group's report. The Minister tabled an amendment to raise that amount to £250,000. In view of the raising of the threshold of the turnover of a company, I thought the balance sheet threshold might also be raised from £1.5 million to £2 million. On Committee Stage the Minister of State said that the balance sheet threshold may be amended in line with EU law and under those circumstances I did not press my amendment. Perhaps the Minister of State would tell us whether the increase in the balance sheet threshold of a company under EU law has been decided and indicate the position on raising the balance sheet threshold of a company from £1.5 million to £2 million?</P>

      <P>Section 32 sets out the conditions which companies must meet, if they are to be exempted from the requirement to have their accounts audited. One of the conditions is that the balance sheet total of the company does not exceed £1.5 million. As I outlined on Committee Stage, this is in line with the definition of small companies in section 8 of the 1986 Companies <Col N="35" /> (Amendment) Act. If we increase the balance sheet threshold for small companies it will mean some companies, which are not small within the definition of section 8 of the 1986 Companies (Amendment) Act, could be eligible to avail of the exemption from having accounts audited. This could cause confusion and would be inconsistent and unwise. The appropriate time to review this threshold for the exemption to have accounts audited will be as part of the upcoming review of existing and proposed European Union directives dealing with the thresholds relating to small companies for disclosure purposes.</P>
      <P>An important point about this proposed review is that we should be aware that any increase in the thresholds under section 8 of the 1986 Companies (Amendment) Act would exempt a greater number of companies from disclosing information and all the implications of such a move would need to be carefully considered. On that basis and in view of the fact that these directives have to be considered in the future, I regret I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment, as it would be unwise to do so.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He made it clear on Committee Stage that it is possible that section 8 of the 1986 Act shall be reviewed soon in light of existing and proposed European Union directives. If the Minister is obliged as a result of EU law to change the balance sheet threshold of a company from £1.5 million upwards, I do not understand why if we did that now it would bring some companies that did not qualify for exemption from having their accounts audited into that net. A company must qualify under all the conditions set out in section 32(3) to qualify for exemption. In other words, the conditions mentioned in subsection (1) are that: in respect of the year concerned the company is a company to which the Act of 1986 applies; that the amount of turnover does not exceed £250,000; the balance sheet total of the company does not exceed £1.5 million; and the average number of persons employed by the company does not exceed 50. The Minister of State said that if he raised the balance sheet threshold of a company from £1.5 million to £2 million, it might bring in a plethora of other companies under that rule, but I do not see how it could. He is saying the only one reason they have to carry out an audit, it is that their balance sheet totals are above £1.5 million Is he saying a large number of companies qualify under the Act, their turnovers are £250,000, the average number of persons they employ is under 50 and the only factor stopping them from qualifying under section 32 is that their balance sheet totals are a little more than £1.5 million? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average number of persons is fewer than 50 and the only thing stopping them from qualifying under section 32 is that their balance sheet is above £1.5 million. That seems unfair. A company could have fewer than 50 employees and a <Col N="36" /> turnover of £250,000, but their balance sheet might show a higher figure because the value of their product could be greater than another product. This means they would have to carry out an audit. I will not press this amendment to a vote because the Minister of State will come back to it soon, but perhaps he could explain it to me. Some companies do not need to carry out an audit except under subsection (3)<i>(a)</i>(iii).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that we can also amend under subsection (7). We are trying to maintain consistency between the small companies which are designated under the 1986 Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> the proposals for audit under the 1990 Act and this legislation. That option is available under the European Union directive; it is not mandatory or obligatory. There is a huge difference between a balance sheet of £1.5 million and £2 million as laid down in company law. If we accept this proposal, a large number of companies would be exempt. The vast majority of companies in Ireland are small and medium-sized enterprises. A company which employs 30, 40 or 50 people is in the medium category. A large number of companies employ between two and 50 people. If we lift this exemption, we will open the door and I am not prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>There is a major difference. If a company has a good accountant, the figures could be manipulated for exemption purposes. Most companies are required by the Revenue Commissioners to carry out an audit of their tax returns, regardless of exemptions. Most accountants will carry out full audits, although they may not be required to do so under legislation. If companies are well advised on the cut-off figure, they can do their homework to get the benefits.</P>

      <P>I re-emphasise that we want to maintain consistency between the Companies <Col N="37" /> (Amendment) Act, 1986, the Companies Act, 1990, and this legislation. Deputy Perry's contribution has shown why we want to do this. A small change could exempt many companies and we cannot allow that to happen. There is a difference between a company law audit and a Revenue audit, although I accept the Revenue Commissioners require more company audits than heretofore. It would be unwise for us to change the difference between the 1986 Act and the 1990 Act as that would not maintain consistency within the law, which we, as legislators, should do. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>40.&ndash;Section 297A of the Principal Act (inserted by section 138 of the Companies Act, 1990) is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (2)<i>(a)</i> of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;<i>(aa)</i> he was responsible for the failure by the company to have adequate employers' liability insurance in respect of any personal injury caused to any or all of its employees and for which the company has been or would have been held liable in damages; or'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment derives from a case that came to trial some time ago where a mine worker was seriously injured. In taking an action against the company, the company went into liquidation on the day before the trial. The worker then sought relief against the directors of the company but the Supreme Court ultimately decided there was no obligation on the directors to respond to the absence of insurance cover, although it was admitted the worker was seriously injured. As the law stands, the Supreme Court would hold again that there is no duty on directors to provide adequate insurance for their workers.</P>
      <P>Section 297A of the Principal Act refers to reckless trading. The effect of this amendment would be to amend the definition of reckless trading to include failing to provide adequate insurance cover for personal injury to employees. I hope the Minister of State responds positively because I was taken aback by his response on Committee Stage. It is extraordinary that a company is required to provide insurance for its vehicles which travel on public roads, but it is not required to provide insurance for its employees. The best the Minister of State could say the last day when replying was that this was not a matter for company law but for labour law or health and safety regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of thing bedevils legislation in what is a more complex era than before. I know it is necessary to structure Departments on the basis of specialisation. However, it takes a superhuman effort on behalf of the political system to pull <Col N="38" /> these sections together and to get them to co-operate sensibly when legislation is going through the House. It is clear that on the last occasion the Minister of State was given a note from his officials stating that they were busy, they were experts in their area, it was not a matter for them but for Davitt House or health and safety regulations and that it would be improper to include it in this legislation. I find that frustrating. It is difficult to bring different Departments together and to ask them to put their heads together to come up with sensible legislation. I do not say that to criticise the excellent civil servants. However, it seems that legislative time is precious in this House.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary approach to deal only with certain sections and not go outside a compartmentalised area. What could be more important than circumstances where a company is treating its workers recklessly in respect of liability insurance? One only has to look at the building industry. It is an open secret that because of the building boom it is taking short cuts and cutting corners. Sometimes, sadly, the casualties are the workers. The number of fatalities in the past year is almost double what was the norm in the industry. It is not confined to the building industry. I instanced the case of Sweeney<i> v.</i> Duggan which was decided in the Supreme Court and involved a mineworker.</P>
    <P>A transport company which owns a large fleet of trucks is required to insure them. However, one is not required to insure workers. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, tells me he agrees with me and has great sympathy for my argument but that it is not his job. It is a crazy way to do business. We are introducing relevant legislation and workers ought to be given this minimal protection. If they were, we would not have a problem because 99 per cent of companies would comply. It would be one of those things companies would have to do. If they want to agree terms with their trade unions or workers, it is a matter for them; I am not interested in that. However, it is wrong that a family should be left in the circumstances of that particular worker, who is by no means an isolated case. It is unacceptable that a family should have someone crippled on a building site, in a mine or hurt in a factory and then discover they are pauperised. I hope the Minister has changed his tune since the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, as I did on Committee Stage. As I said then, it is extraordinary that Part IV of this legislation is entitled &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;. When I was Minister for Justice, I called that housekeeping legislation, where one gathered a number of laws which had fallen through the cracks. I instituted a system where miscellaneous criminal justice legislation would be introduced as often as possible, at least every one or two years, to include laws which had been lost in more important legislation. If the word &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; means anything, it should be an <Col N="39" /> opportunity for the Minister to deal with issues which have become more topical and relevant than when legislation was passed in the 1980s or early 1990s.</P>
      <P>It is incomprehensible that the Minister could stand over the argument that employer liability is labour law. We are dealing with companies. Auditors will commit an offence if they fail to comply with certain sections. Why are employers not being included in this provision? It is illegal for an employer not to pay PRSI contributions for their employees. Why should it not be an offence for an employer not to pay insurance cover for accidents which occur in a place of work? This has become more relevant since Committee Stage because we now know the statistics for deaths and injuries on building sites are increasing every month. This is not only because of the speed with which buildings are being erected but also because of greater levels of employment. More unskilled people are working on building sites and factory floors. There is not enough time to train them because there is extreme urgency in getting buildings and houses finished for clients.</P>
      <P>This is an opportune time to discuss and improve the law on employers' liability. Perhaps the Minister will tell us again that this is a matter for the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. I cannot understand why the Minister has not discussed this matter with him. This is an opportunity for the Minister to shine in the area of the Department for which he has responsibility and to accept this amendment. If he will not do so, I want a commitment from him that a similar amendment will be contained in the next legislation introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. I do not want the Minister to tell me that the Attorney General will advise him against introducing an amendment such as this under a section headed &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;. I do not believe that is true. When Mr. McDowell was a Member of this House he often asked me to introduce amendments to legislation that encompassed sections which might have been better included in other legislation but to use the Bill then under discussion to do this. He will not be able to say to the Minister that this amendment will not be relevant if made under a miscellaneous section in companies legislation. The Minister should not use as a defence the possibility that the Attorney General will not allow him to do this because I do not think he can stand over such advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is major legislation and I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment. Given that most businesses, particularly those in the building and services industry, are extremely profitable, most business people are prepared to factor in the huge cost of customer liability. If this amendment is accepted, it will help those employed in high risk jobs, particularly in the construction industry. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte about the loss to families when someone is confined to a <Col N="40" /> wheelchair and left dependent on social welfare because of lack of cover. It is unbelievable. This Bill is making major reforms to company law. The responsibility rests with the Minister to ensure that companies are obliged by law that their staff are covered. The PAYE sector is covered by PRSI but this is totally inadequate as regards life cover and compensation. Many people are benefiting from setting up companies, especially directors who are in no way personally liable. A company is a third person and statutorily directors are not liable for any risk. It is important that a safeguard for employees is built into the profitability structure of companies. They often assume directors are responsible but they are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the genuine concerns expressed by Deputies on Committee Stage regarding the problems arising from companies not having appropriate personal injury insurance for their employees, I have, as promised, looked at this matter again and I have consulted with my colleague, the Minister of State, and officials in the Department. The cost of insurance, as well as being high in Ireland in comparison with competing economies, is particularly prohibitive for small companies. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs, published in 1996, indicated that some small companies are paying up to 8 per cent of payroll in employer liability costs. Underwriting losses for liability insurers amounted to nearly £80 million in 1997. Faced with a pattern of increasing losses, the likely reaction of insurers to the provision of compulsory employers' liability insurance would be to increase rates, reduce capacity or opt out of the market altogether &ndash; in other words, there would be no cover. Insurers would inevitably have to insure known bad risks with consequent effects on each insurer's risk profile.</P>
      <P>The insurance federation has estimated that less than 5 per cent of firms are uninsured and surveys carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche would support this figure. In the United Kingdom, where employers' liability has been compulsory for over 30 years, insurers have introduced upper limits on cover because of restrictions on market capacity. The law has had to reflect these changes. The question of moral hazard also arises where firms with poor health and safety records might rely on their compulsory insurance cover rather than investing in health and safety compliance. We have to make sure there is a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be fully aware that a special working group under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan McCauley is examining alternative or complementary methods for delivering personal injury compensation in a more economic and equitable way. The working group has been examining radical solutions in this regard and exploring systems which rely on a combination of social security, voluntary insurance schemes based on employer-employee agreements, and tort liability. The tort system of compensation for personal injury is <Col N="41" /> wholly dependent on the capacity of the insurance industry to meet claims costs, and this in turn depends on the capacity and willingness of individuals and companies to pay for the increased premium charges. We therefore believe that the question of compulsory employers' liability insurance might best be considered following Government consideration of the McCauley findings and recommendations and, as I already indicated on Committee Stage, in the context of any future partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>In a separate development which I very much welcome, I can confirm that agreement has been drawn up between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Construction Industry Federation to help improve safety on building sites. In an initiative overseen by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, these two bodies and the Health and Safety Authority are coming together to set up a new body, the construction safety partnership, which will produce a safety plan within three months. I trust that these efforts are to the satisfaction of my colleagues and I commend all involved with them.</P>
    <P>While Deputies have made a very sincere and genuine case, we must ensure that we do not make insurance premia too high, that we do not reduce capacity or force insurers out of the market, and that we allow this committee to report and make its recommendations to Government so that the matter will be dealt with in a future legal framework.</P>

He has another little record he plays whenever he wants to talk about the fantastic state of the economy, yet he argues that the reason he cannot bring in insurance cover for employees is that it would reduce capacity.</P>

      <P>On the last day the Bill was debated, the Minister of State argued against this amendment on the basis that it had nothing to do with company law, that it was a matter for health and safety and for the labour section of the Department. He has changed his argument today to an economic one concerning the cost of insurance and reduced capacity. Then, just after telling us about the cost of insurance, he goes on to say that only 5 per cent of companies are uninsured. If that is true, why is it a cost consideration? Where does the Minister of State stand on the relative merits of the cost of insurance compared to the cost of human life and serious crippling injury in the rogue companies or companies that are less prudent than they ought to be? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> One of the tremendous assets of civil servants is that they can write English to make it appear plausible, provided the Opposition is kept in ignorance of what is going on. However, it really takes some hard neck to tell me to await the McCauley proposals. I established the McCauley working group in 1996. When I left office, the McCauley recommendations in respect of a stand-alone employment appeals tribunal, where uncontested personal injuries would be resolved outside the strict court framework, were due to be implemented. The Government never implemented them, however. Three years later nothing has happened, yet we can go on whingeing about the cost of insurance. The reason I set up the McCauley working group was because of the cost of insurance which I believed was disproportionate for small companies. Measures were agreed to deal with this, but three years later the Minister of State is falling back on cost as the reason he cannot take on board measures to provide reasonable protection to workers in this situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is afraid to accept the amendment because he says it will add costs, might put people out of work and make companies unviable if they have to pay an extra few thousand pounds for annual insurance cover. Yet 95 per cent of companies, according to the Minister of State, are perfectly happy to be covered and it has not put them in jeopardy. We are talking about trying to catch those 5 per cent in the net so that their employees &ndash; they could represent 50 or 1,000 people &ndash; will have an expectation that somebody will be responsible for their insurance cover if something happens to them on the company's premises.</P>
      <P>The awfully sad fact is that many of those cases end up in court because somebody is left in a wheelchair for life or is brain damaged. Their wives and children are left to live on a pittance &ndash; the generosity and charity of the State &ndash; when the accident may have occurred on the job, yet they cannot obtain recompense from their employer. Of course, they can get State invalidity pensions and disability payments, but why should the taxpayer pick up the burden of that accident when the employer should pay? If only 5 per cent of companies are involved, this measure will not have a cataclysmic effect at a time of great wealth in the country because, as the Minister of State said, 95 per cent of companies are compliant.</P>

      <P>Certain companies could be categorised as high risk ones, particularly in the construction industry. The risks would obviously not be as great in restaurants or supermarkets. The Minister of State should categorise companies as high risk ones that could build in cover. The insurance contribution rate in the PAYE sector is up to 20 per cent but employees are getting a very bad deal in return for that. There should be a reduction in rates on condition that private cover is provided in high risk companies. In that way the compensation would be far better. As Deputy Owen said, people who are injured and unable to work for life receive levels of compensation from the State which are totally inadequate to deal with their requirements and the maintenance of family life. That is regrettable. The Minister of State may not be able to include every company under the terms of the Bill but high risk sectors, such as the construction industry where the greatest tragedies have occurred in the past year, should guarantee that their employees are adequately covered in the event of an accident.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am basing my position on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, the information available to us, the patterns in the United Kingdom and the work of McCauley. I salute Deputy Rabbitte for setting up the McCauley group. I have dealt with it and <Col N="44" /> the various interim reports in terms of the progress that has been made. It would be much better to allow the McCauley team and the professionals involved, who include employers, the  unions and others and who are doing tremendous work, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is also working on this area, to come forward with recommendations. I should not pre-empt or prejudice a report which will be presented. This report will consider the totality of this area and what is best for the country and commercial business in terms of risk and insurance cover. It is not advisable to do anything else now and I regret I cannot accept the amendment on account of the excellent work which is ongoing.</P>

Ireland is no longer a poor economy and nobody is seriously arguing that we cannot support a measure which would make it obligatory that insurance cover be provided for workers in these circumstances. That would not in any way cut across the work of Mr. Dan McCauley's committee which is concerned with the law-abiding companies which are already paying insurance. Its purpose is to consider whether the costs can be reduced. It is similar to the Minister and I paying more for car insurance because of the number of cars on the road which are uninsured. I am asking the Minister, with the support of my colleagues on this side, to bring the aberrant companies into line. This would not cut across anything which the McCauley committee is doing.</P>
      <P>There are many issues to be considered, including the attendant legal costs involved in allowing these types of insurance cases to go to court before they are settled on the steps of the courthouse. Most of the costs have been already incurred at that stage. There is also a need to consider the inadequate health and safety standards tolerated by some companies, which are also a contributing factor. I greatly regret that the McCauley proposals are not yet in practice. It is a great pity but that is another day's discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most disappointed that the Minister appears to have set his face against the amendment without any substantial argument against it. It is a criticism of the way legislation is made that as far as the Minister and his excellent civil servants are concerned, they have a certain limited remit and they will stick to it come hell or high water. They are not interested in proposals from the Opposition. If I had had the foresight to meet Deputy Healy-Rae, explain my case to him and persuade him of its merits, I am sure he could have delivered. However, an Opposition which takes the legislative process seriously cannot deliver. If one does not involve oneself in legislation and one only wants something out of the pork barrel for one's constituency, one finds one<Col N="45" /> self holding the balance of power in the House and the Government will accede to whatever one wants. That is a sad state of affairs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 47, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall not be an employee of any agent of the company being established&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to copperfasten the point that, in the setting up of an Irish registered non-resident company, a secretary, a cleaning lady or a caretaker who is an employee of the agent of the company being established would not have their name put down on the register. The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would take another look at it. Has he reconsidered it? Has he recognised that in tightening up the system of Irish registered non-resident companies we do not want to leave any loopholes that could be exploited? I highlighted an example which was mentioned in the August edition of the<i> Finance Dublin</i> magazine. Has the Minister given this matter further consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the matter further consideration. As I explained on Committee Stage, having a resident director provision means we must be careful to ensure that we comply with our European Union Treaty requirements such as freedom to provide services and no discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Consequently, we must also allow for maximum flexibility and not exclude any particular category of persons from appointment as a resident director. While some companies may not like appointing a resident director from the category of persons referred to in the Deputy's amendment, they may have no choice if they wish to opt for the resident director as opposed to the alternative of a bond.</P>
      <P>In any event, I am confident the overall package of taxation and company law measures will impose restrictions on people who seek to use Irish companies for undesirable purposes. Irish resident directors appointed from whatever source will be required to discharge their duties in a responsible manner. I hope this explains the reason I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister is satisfied that people will not exploit the situation by naming somebody as a director of 25 companies. I hope the Bill will prevent such cases. The purpose of the measure is to ensure that the person named <Col N="46" /> as a director has an interest or involvement in the company. I do not believe the general statement that the person will be resident in the State is tight enough to ensure that the provision will not be exploited.</P>
      <P>When the rules regarding the registration of companies were established, I am sure the Minister of the day did not envisage the way in which the law would be exploited by people to set up Irish registered non-resident companies and use them for serious criminal activity. On Committee Stage I outlined some of the cases I came across when I was the Minister for Justice where companies were registered at an address not a million miles away from Leinster House. Up to 70 of those companies turned up in investigations into money laundering. Nobody knew what those companies were doing. Somebody went in and put down names, but the companies were allegedly being used as conduits for money laundering.</P>
      <P>I wish to be sure the Minster of State is satisfied with the provisions of section 43, subsections (1) and (2). Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to <i>subsection (3) </i>and <i>section 44, </i>one, at least, of the directors for the time being of a company, not being a company referred to in <i>subsection (2), </i>shall, on and from the commencement of this section, be a person who is resident in the State.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) goes on to provide that at least one of the directors for the time being of a company, being a company the memorandum of which was delivered to the registrar of companies &ldquo;shall, on and from the date that is 12 months after commencement of this section, be a person who is resident in the State.&rdquo;  That could be somebody with some, but very minimal involvement with the company. The person could be named as a director under the umbrella by which the company secures its legality under this legislation. Is the Minister of State satisfied that the very loose description of a person who is resident in the State will prevent the kind of abuse that has happened?</P>

      <P>The definition of residency is covered later. We want to ensure that a person will be resident in the State. I have already said they will be subject to all aspects of company law pertaining to the holder of directorship positions. That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have received numerous representations regarding our proposal to put a limit on the number of companies of which a person can be a director. We have been told by professionals, company formation agents and others that it is unfair, unnecessary and discriminatory to confine the number to 25. We have stuck rigidly to a figure of 25. We have consulted State agencies and others and are satisfied this is the correct figure. The important thing is that the person is resident in the State. Once they are resident here they must conform, in the manner of responding and <Col N="47" /> signing documents as a director of a company, to all the exigencies and responsibilities that appointment confers on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of a person resident in the State who is a director of 25 companies, it is important, from the point of view of formation agents establishing companies on behalf of outside investors, that those nominated as directors have a knowledge of the companies with which they are involved. In certain cases to date, people have been appointed directors of companies unawares. The Companies Office should officially notify them of their appointment and responsibilities as director.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a sub-company in Ireland should be done on the basis of being an employee of the company as against merely being a nominee. In certain cases a company director need not be an employee. This is a huge grey area. I envisage that in the future a select number of people will hold directorships of every company. They will not have a notion of where they stand, will not have direct involvement and will not benefit. This area needs further amendment.</P>

      <P>Under section 3 of the Companies Act, 1982, a person who becomes a director of a company must sign a document stating he is prepared to become a director. Under European law we cannot debar anybody from becoming a director of a company. The courts must find a person unfit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation referred to by the Minister of State is in some instances not worth the paper it is written on because we are all aware of cases where secretaries and such like have been appointed directors. For example, the practice has been for secretaries to solicitors and clerks in solicitors' offices to be made company directors. They have no involvement in the operation of the company and are usually required simply to sign documents. The Minister of State does not fool us into believing that the legislation to which he referred provides a good umbrella.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a bond, which is the alternative requirement to having an Irish resident director, entails extensive regulation by which the nominated person will pay the bond or be responsible for it. For example, section 43(6) states:</P>
      <P>The nominated person shall keep all proper and usual accounts, including an income and expenditure account and a balance sheet, . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a huge onus is placed on the nominated person to guarantee the bond, a similar onus is not placed on the person declared to be resident in the State who becomes a director thereby <Col N="48" /> fulfilling a condition by which a company obtains legitimacy.</P>
    <P>A company can obtain legitimacy in three ways. First, it may secure the appointment of an Irish resident director, second, it may procure a bond or, third, it may obtain a certificate under the auspices of the Companies Registration Office. While the legislation spells out the conditions to be fulfilled in procuring a bond, there are fewer provisions regarding the Irish resident director. Perhaps existing legislation provides for this, but if so, it has not worked very well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) A notification in writing to the registrar of companies of the matter referred to in <i>subsection (9)(b)</i> shall not, of itself, be regarded as constituting defamatory matter.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 43(9) obliges the last person who is a director of the company, who is resident in the State and who ceases to be a director to make a notification in writing to the registrar of companies of the fact that he or she has ceased to be a director as well as the fact that there are no other directors of the company who are resident in the State. Subsection (10) then provides that where the last resident director in the State fails to comply with subsection (9), that person shall be jointly or severally liable with the company for any final penalty that may be imposed under section 43(3).</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, which inserts a new subsection (10), is to offer protection to the outgoing resident director of a company who notifies the registrar that to his or her knowledge there is no other director of the company resident in the State. This protection is considered necessary as the information notifying that there is no other director of the company resident in the State may not be 100 per cent accurate. The absence of such protection might act as a deterrent for compliance with the obligation in subsection (9). A similar protection is being provided for in section 47.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did this provision originate? I do not recall discussing it to any great extent. Will this mean that to register as a company a person is named as a director but that after a year the director may resign, leaving the company intact but with no Irish resident director?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to be a back door way of setting up a company. It allows a director to pull out after a <Col N="49" /> year if he or she is not satisfied. What will happen to the company if there is not an Irish resident director in the country? Does the bond suddenly come into play? What will happen if the company is registered because a director is resident in Ireland and he or she then decides to pull out? The amendment proposes to prevent a person who pulls out from being accused of defamatory action because the act of pulling out could be read as meaning that he or she thinks something crooked is going on in the company and pulled out before getting caught up in it. I believe this is the purpose of the amendment, but the Minister of State gave a different reason for it. I do not want a back door amendment which would allow people escape their duties as directors after a year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled as to the necessity for the amendment. The Minister of State has not given an adequate explanation for this. In addition to what Deputy Owen has said, I do not understand why there would be a presumption in certain circumstances that the director concerned would need to be protected from defamation action. Will the Minister of State give an example of the kind of circumstance where, if it were not for this provision, an ex-director might be open to defamation proceedings? I am not sure I can envisage such circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an element of escape in this amendment. If a person who is a director of a number of companies wishes to resign from a company after a certain period leaving no Irish director on the company, who will monitor the situation and how will it be identified given the huge growth in the number of companies in recent times? Will a person be appointed to carry out this task or will there be spot checks? This will give comfort to directors who sign up to one of 25 companies. There is a real sign-off element to this amendment because it will not be as difficult to be an Irish director. The same risks will not be attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Owen, this emanated from a review of the Bill, particularly of section 47, to which it is linked. We are trying to protect the State and the systems of enforceability. The Companies Office has certain responsibilities. The proposed new director of corporate enforcement, for which we propose to legislate in the future, will play a key role in this area. We want to put more responsibility on the resident Irish director. A director could write a letter to the secretary of the company stating he or she has resigned from the company. The Companies Office or the director of corporate enforcement may not be aware of this; no one may be aware of it. This might not be discovered for five years and the company could continue trading legally. We are putting the onus on the resident director that if he or she resigns from office, as well as notifying the company secretary, <Col N="50" /> he or she must also notify the Registrar of Companies. If such directors do not do so, they, together with the company of which they were previously a director, will be jointly and separately liable for any fines, penalties or otherwise imposed on the company. As far as we are concerned they, too, will suffer the brunt of the law. This puts the onus on them to ensure they notify the State authorities that they have resigned from office.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Rabbitte, if a notification is made under section 43(9) there may be another resident person on the directorship of the company, but the director resigning may not be aware of this. The proposed amendment will help to clarify this matter.</P>

      <P>I question the legality of the amendment, given that one of my amendments was disallowed because it was not raised on Committee Stage. Who made the submission on section 47? He stated, &ldquo;While a great amount of thought and discussion went into the development of the provision as it stands, some further thoughts on the detailed application of the section and matters that might be added to it making it more workable in practice, have been submitted to us. Time did not permit us to complete our examination.&rdquo; Does this mean those of us who are not familiar with every aspect of a Committee Stage debate can state we are not sure we examined the entire content of a certain section and, therefore, may come back with more amendments? Does this give Members the key to table amendments on Report Stage which they have not specifically identified? This is what the Minister of State did here and it legally allowed him to table an amendment for which we had no notice. Who made the submission on section 47 stating, &ldquo;more workable in practice.time did not permit us to complete our examination of these issues.&rdquo;  What body or person prompted this amendment?</P>

Section 43(9)(b) states, &ldquo;to his or her knowledge, no other director of the company is resident in the State,&rdquo;. I am still seeking an example of how the act of notifying the registrar could lay the director open to defamation. In certain circumstances, this could be an invitation to canny directors to get out before the going gets hot and they are protected from defamation and so on. I am not sure I can understand this provision. Given that we are running out of time, perhaps we should recommit it to Committee Stage and discuss it because I am not persuaded at this stage.</P>

It gave us no forewarning as to the content of the amendment. We had some idea of the contents of every other amendment because he said he would come back on Report Stage.

      <P>It must be understood that there are companies registered in this country which trade legitimately and want to do business here. The Law Society made a detailed submission to us on this issue since Committee Stage and we considered it in detail. If a person wants to resign as a director, he or she notifies the company secretary and the registrar of companies.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The progress to date of the National Millennium Committee is outlined in detail in the progress report which I circulated to all Members of the House on 28 September last. I intend circulating an updated version of the report to Members shortly which will include recent developments.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee was established in November 1998 to advise on suitable national projects for inclusion in the Government's millennium programme and its work will cover the period 1999 through to the end of the year 2000. On the recommendations of the committee, the Government has to date approved nearly £23 million funding to millennium projects. I propose to outline details of a number of these projects and also to include details in the progress report to be circulated to Members. I also propose to update the House on the Government's millennium programme.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee's plan to mark and celebrate this most remarkable of historical benchmarks is well advanced. As the end of this 1,000 year cycle fast approaches, it is worth reminding ourselves that a millennium comes about only once every 40 generations. That gives some indication of the scale involved and we should all feel privileged to be members of the generation which will witness this unique time. That privilege also brings with it a clear responsibility to commemorate the millennium in a way that is inclusive, lasting, rewarding and dignified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I speak for all the members of what is <Col N="53" /> a dedicated and committed National Millennium Committee when I state that our plans are for a millennium which will be memorable for all the right reasons. The National Millennium Committee is finalising a comprehensive millennium programme designed to reach out to everybody. It will encourage people everywhere to take part in witnessing the end of a century and a millennium and the dawning of a new era. At the same time, we will be stressing the millennium is also a time for reflection, a time to search for and identify the real reason we have a millennium to celebrate. The programme we are finalising will draw on our past heritage, culture and experiences while at the same time reflecting the modern, vibrant country we now have as we prepare to step into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>It has been a core belief of the National Millennium Committee since its inception that the way we mark the millennium must be lasting and of benefit to the future generations which will lead this country deep into the new millennium. We could have lost the run of ourselves and channelled the entire £30 million into one non-stop party, spent millions on a national fireworks display or even blown it all on a wheel of fortune in the middle of O'Connell Street. Instead, we have struck what I confidently believe is an acceptable balance between the celebrations and other events and projects designed to reflect the enormous significance of this milestone in history.</P>
    <P>The committee has identified three major flagship projects and agreed funding for 48 national projects which will rise to at least 60 in the coming months. To date, 106 community projects have been selected for funding and this will rise to at least 150. Three separate awards initiatives have been set up which will result in direct support for more than 1,200 locally based events and projects and the committee is co-ordinating a national programme of events for the millennium weekend.</P>
    <P>To date the National Millennium Committee has identified three visionary flagship projects: the last light ceremony will be a simple, symbolic and poignant national event built around the final sunset of the millennium; the millennium family tree is an innovative project which will see more than one million native Irish oak trees planted in forests and woods throughout the country with each of the trees being ascribed to a household; and, the children's hour fundraising initiative has the full support and endorsement of the committee whereby everyone in the workforce is being asked to contribute their last hour's pay to this millennium initiative to raise funds for children's causes.</P>
    <P>The millennium is also about celebration and the programme now being finalised by the committee for the millennium weekend &ndash; New Year's Eve, New Year's Day and 2 January &ndash; will tap into the growing sense of excitement. It will include spectacular fireworks displays in Dublin and other locations; a day long concert in Dublin and other concerts at venues throughout <Col N="54" /> the country; the lighting of the bridges across the River Liffey in Dublin and the River Lee in Cork; all the bells in the country will be rung out for several minutes from midnight to herald the arrival of the new millennium; civic events, including tree planting, flag raising and recognition ceremonies, will take place in virtually all counties on new year's day; a unique ecumenical celebration, combining cultural, traditional and spiritual aspects, will be held in Dublin on 2 January and will be linked to ecumenical events in Northern Ireland; RTE will broadcast live from 11 a.m. on 31 December until 4 a.m. on 1 January and will compile 60 hours of programming to commemorate the millennium; a national two minute pause for reflection will be held on New Year's Day; special presentations will be made to all children born on New Year's Day and also to their parents; the new £1 millennium coin will be officially launched on New Year's Day; and a modern version of Messiah XXI will be televised nationwide.</P>
    <P>The programme for the millennium is very much geared towards leaving positive reminders of the millennium. I have referred to the fact that the committee has agreed funding for 48 national projects designed to do just that. I will circulate details of those projects but some examples are as follows: the provision of £2 million towards the cost of two flagship projects of Míle Átha Cliath, the Liffey of lights and the boardwalk; up to £500,000 for the refurbishment of the Gaiety Theatre; £300,000 to the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery to reconstruct the Francis Bacon studio as a centrepiece of the gallery's collection; £50,000 to the Children's Cultural Centre, The Ark, Temple Bar for a millennium music theatre show and a visual arts programme on the nativity; £400,000 towards the new Church of Ireland Gascoigne home for the elderly; £100,000 to St. Brigid's parish for its children's centre project; £100,000 for the permanent floodlighting of more than 20 churches in the Dublin diocese and £50,000 to rehang the St. George's bells.</P>
    <P>Other national projects include the allocation of £750,000 to SHARE in Cork towards the building of a day care centre; £1 million for projects, productions and exhibitions which celebrate 2,000 years of Christianity, including the floodlighting of churches countrywide, the funding of bells for churches, the development of ancient pilgrim paths, a peace park beside Croagh Patrick, County Mayo, and the provision of accommodation facilities for pilgrims to Glendalough, County Wicklow; £500,000 for a new footbridge across the River Lee; and £250,000 to the Irish Wheelchair Association towards the provision of a mobility centre in Clane, County Kildare. A sum of £250,000 has been awarded to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for the development of a site it owns in Dublin as a special facility; £210,000 has been awarded to the Simon Community for refurbishment programmes in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Dundalk; £300,000 has been awarded to Cork Corporation <Col N="55" /> for the permanent illumination of a number of prominent bridges; £500,000 has been provided to rescue the historic lighthousekeepers houses at five of Ireland's headlands in Counties Cork, Clare, Kerry, Antrim and Down; £531,000 has been awarded for the purchase of a cinemobile &ndash; a Bord Scannán na hÉireann project; the Bank of Ireland has advanced £10 million for the millennium scholars' trust to support scholars over a ten year period; £100,000 has been provided towards <i>The Whoseday Book</i>, a unique millennium year diary in aid of the Irish Hospice Foundation; and £80,000 has been provided for <i>The Millennium Book</i>, a unique treasure trove of the thoughts of 4,000 students throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The £3 million millennium events awards will guarantee funding and promotional support for up to 1,000 events. There have been 1,400 applications for funding under the millennium recognition awards &ndash; we recently announced 106 awards and hope to make some more in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Does he agree that most of the events and initiatives he has outlined simply augment funding which is already ongoing through national lottery grants and a variety of Government Departments? The Minister outlined three flagship events, the last lights, the tree planting and the children's hour project. There is no lasting impacting monument to the millennium such as the declaration to abolish illiteracy and the implementation of a funding structure for that or a declaration to abolish homelessness. Does the Minister agree that such declarations would represent a much more fitting end to the millennium and the current state of the Irish economy? </P>
      <P>The Minister previously announced an initiative in regard to a millennium candle for all Irish households. I notice that is not mentioned. Has that scheme been dropped or will it go ahead? If it is to go ahead, how and when will the candles be distributed and what will be the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree these programmes would normally be pursued. The last lights ceremony is certainly not one that is usual. The Simon Community, the Wheelchair Association and the St. Vincent de Paul awards, the special fundraising initiative in respect of the children's hour, boardwalks and the bridges and so on are projects at which the National Millennium Committee looked. The committee looked at more than 800 projects in total. In its wisdom or otherwise, it selected three flagship projects and about 60 national projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 60 national projects strike a balance between doing things, as the Deputy mentioned, for the homeless &ndash; we have been able to give some support to the Simon Community, although not as much as we wished &ndash; and the celebratory aspect. We thought about the three flagship pro<Col N="56" /> jects at length. The committee advertised and invited Deputies, Senators and colleagues to put forward proposals on what we might do. Having received 800 or so ideas and submissions, the committee unanimously came to the conclusion that the three flag ship projects at which we arrived were the best available to us.</P>
    <P>We did not get proposals to build domes, big wheels or such items. We got many proposals, as the Deputy said, to help the homeless, and we have done that. We have tried to strike a balance between not augmenting existing programmes and giving the odd programme a push where it deserved it, as in the case of Simon. The three flagship projects include the last lights project. That will be a very poignant ceremony for communities. There are plans to hold a major concert in College Green and the last lights ceremony will take place in the middle of that concert. The committee unanimously felt that was a nice idea rather than have people congregate at midnight. Rather than putting all the focus on midnight on New Year's Eve, we would try to bring it back to 4.30 p.m. when the last light of the century and decade fades so that extended families and children could get involved. That is how the last lights idea was born.</P>
    <P>The proposal to plant an oak tree for every household in four forests is well developed and if at all possible, the name of the household will be attached to the tree. We believe the planting of oak trees is a lasting project &ndash; I understand we are quite short of such trees &ndash; which will celebrate each household. Children's hour will make a lasting impact in that a couple of million pounds will be collected from all of us. I hope the last hour of our income will go to the children's hour. These are lasting projects which will help children, grow oak trees and which will allow families to gather at about 4.30 p.m. to celebrate the millennium.</P>
    <P>The candle project is still on. The post office will post the candles before the millennium. We are in negotiation with the post office as to the precise cost of that. The candles will cost around £900,000, although I do not have the exact figure. The committee is very excited about that project. It will allow Ireland, in a poignant and sensible way, to reflect on the century as the last light fades, and I encourage everyone to take part.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not refer to Question No. 4 in his reply. Will he outline any arrangements being made by both Governments for joint celebrations? I am sure the Minister will accept that despite the dark and negative aspect of the relationship between both countries over the past 800 years, there have been a positive ones as well in the areas of literature, sport, religion, architecture and law. Our entire legal system is based on the British one, as is the running of this House. Will the Minister outline any efforts being made by the Government to hold joint celebratory events next year?</P>

      <P>I should have referred to that. There is a number of North-South projects. The committee awarded £1 million to the Manchester project, the Irish centre in Manchester, which was approved by the Government and announced. That is a major flagship project which has also received the support of the British Government and the UK Manchester council. It is an £11 million or £12 million project and we are contributing £1 million as our way of saluting and recognising the Irish abroad at the turn of the century and of thanking them for their support for Ireland. We thought it was fitting to do that.</P>
      <P>There is also a number of North-South projects, including a Dublin-Belfast ecumenical service and a number of art exhibitions and theatrical performances into which we have jointly entered with the Northern authorities. They are the main items, but we are in close touch with the North and the UK and so far, we have agreed on four or five projects.</P>

      <P>At the recent plenary session of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I raised this matter and it received enthusiastic support from the then Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and from the other members as well. While the initiatives the Minister proposed are plausible, there is a great opportunity for both islands to do something to mark the millennium. With respect, it is something the Minister should have considered further. It would be easy to organise something at this stage which would be very positive and well received.</P>

We started with Manchester and agreed the ecumenical services and the art exhibitions. If there is anything else we can do, we will talk to them about it. I mentioned the lighthouse project earlier. The British Government and the Northern authorities are very keen that we would support the renovation of the light houses. I do not have the note with me but, from memory, they also supported that. Funds are being spent renovating lighthouses in County Antrim and around the Northern coast so the lighthouse keepers houses will be available to the public.</P>

Has he examined that possibility? </P>
      <P>On the question we put down about public transport, the Minister of State said he will come back in a month and I await that reply with interest. However, to take up Deputy Howlin's point, if we are to look at the next millennium, does the Minister of State agree that the theme of the next millennium will be ecological sustainability and that a lasting monument to that would be free public transport in the next millennium, if the Minister of State is interested in doing something along those lines, or are we to be faced at the end of this millennium with price hikes which are unacceptable to ordinary people?</P>

There are link-ups with New York, Boston and London, so there will be substantial communication over that weekend period.</P>
      <P>The Manchester project I mentioned earlier is our main emigrant commitment and is our flagship project.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Question No. 3, I was staggered to hear the Minister of State say that those who supply public transport were considering knocking off early. Surely if we are to bring people into the centre of the city and the gardaí are being asked to cancel all leave, the committee should be concerned with how people are to get to and from events. If there is no public transport a large section of the population cannot experience many of the events, as those without cars will not be able to attend. In the next few weeks the committee members should put their heads together and make certain there is proper public transport. If it is not free it should be at a very reasonable rate, which the Minister of State could support from his budget. This would ensure people could get to and from events. It would be far safer from a security perspective and it would get people in and out of the city centre &ndash; I refer to Dublin in particular &ndash; easily and quickly. If the public transport body cannot provide what the committee feels is an adequate service, surely we can call <Col N="61" /> on the private sector to supply the necessary transport.</P>

That was the only difficulty, as otherwise it was a fine project which the committee would have liked to support.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would want to move fast. On transport, when I made the comment about wanting to knock off early, on a normal Friday night the Nitelink operates from 11.30 p.m. until about 3 a.m., although this will not be a normal Friday night. On a bank holiday the Nitelink would run until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. but the other services would knock off around 10 p.m. We have asked them to see if they can extend this time a little, particularly for the DART, although there are costs involved in doing so. It is not for me to lecture transport workers and I do not wish to do so, but I ask them to remember this is a one-off and not to try to use the occasion to wrestle additional income from any source. I ask them to take on board the spirit of the millennium. We should get through it as a nation with some dignity and not squabble about funds.</P>

      <P>A module on crime and victimisation was included in the quarterly national household survey in the three month period from September to November 1998, inclusive. The module, which included more than 50 questions, will provide valuable information on the incidence and nature of crime and on people's perceptions of crime and safety issues.</P>
      <P>The CSO had previously indicated that it hoped to publish the results of this module in the middle of this year. However, it has taken longer than anticipated to prepare the crime figures for publication. This is because the office has, of necessity, concentrated this year on improving the timetable for collecting and publishing the quarterly labour force figures. Staff changes and the need to give priority to technical development work on the survey have also contributed to the delay. I understand the crime figures will be available in mid November.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has met eight times so far this year. The last meeting was on Thursday, 21 October. The next meeting is scheduled for 17 November. The committee generally meets on a monthly basis.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister outline to the House the number of recommendations from the first and second reports of the ministerial task force on drugs which have been implemented to date and the balance of recommendations which have yet to be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal recommendations have largely been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. These relate to extablishing and evaluating local drugs task forces, which has been completed and has been very positive. The Government took a decision to continue in that manner in dealing with the misuse of drugs. A committee of which I am chairman is currently considering the establishment of the national drugs advisory committee. We hope to bring a proposal to Government at our meeting in December. Therefore, in general the principal recommendations either have been or are in the course of being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the specific recommendations contained in the first and second reports of the ministerial task force which have yet to be implemented? In relation to the geographical location of social deprivation and the link with drugs, is the Minister of State in a position to tell the House whether the information garnered in the work of the committee to date would justify a broadening of the strategy to include other urban areas at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>No particular recommendations which have not been fully implemented come to mind, but I and my officials will trawl through the reports and I will send the Deputy details of any specific recommendations which remain to be implemented. However, I am not aware of any which have not been implemented or which are not in the process of being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the work of the committee and the question of extending its remit, particularly in the area of drugs, we have taken a decision to extend <Col N="63" /> the local drugs task force system through a recent decision to establish a new local drugs task force in the Bray area and by utilising funds from the young people's facilities and services fund to support other projects relative to fighting the misuse of drugs in a number of areas, particularly urban areas around the country. Some of these which come to mind relate to Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Carlow and Bray.</P>
    <P>We have also funded a number of national organisations which have an ability to participate in the fight against the misuse of drugs through reaching young people. Accordingly, we have funded organisations such as the National Youth Federation, the YMCA, ECO, the Irish Girl Guides and the Catholic Youth Council. There are a number of other national organisations which we will consider later on.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in drawing attention to the fact that there is a constant need to expand the remit of the committee and to provide funding to other areas outside those which have been devastated by the misuse of hard drugs, particularly heroin.</P>

Can the Minister tell us whether the committee has discussed the very serious problem of the spread of heroin and other hard drugs outside the greater Dublin area and what measures are being implemented to combat this? Is the Minister aware of the very grave con<Col N="64" /> cern of communities in rural and small town Ireland where there have been a number of deaths, including in my own constituency? Will he agree that a concerted effort by all the statutory and voluntary bodies, our education system and the Garda is necessary to prevent a problem of Dublin proportions spreading throughout the country? Will the Minister raise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the need for an urgent investigation into the issues arising from a recent court case involving a Dublin drug dealer who was acquitted on charges of importing heroin worth £1 million after the jury heard that the importation had been at the behest of his garda handlers&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy expressed concern for citizens of the State regarding the spread of the misuse of drugs outside the areas we are familiar with, something we are all concerned about. However, I remind the Deputy that the national drugs strategy and the associated team was established to tackle the areas hardest hit, particularly <Col N="65" /> by the abuse of heroin and with particular reference to health issues associated with heroin abuse. We are very conscious that so-called soft drugs are obtainable in any place in Ireland and accordingly we have taken a number of initiatives, some of which I mentioned earlier in reply to Deputy Howlin in relation to funding national and regional organisations. Local health boards are very much involved in the fight against drugs through the establishment of drug co-ordinating committees within each health board area. Also, the work of the Garda Síochána in seizing considerable amounts of illicit drugs in recent times is to be applauded. We should call on all communities, regardless of their location, to at all times support the work of the Garda Síochána because with that united effort we will make considerable further progress in seizing illicit drugs. I take this opportunity to compliment the Garda Síochána on its success to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that local task forces are communicating in a meaningful way with local government structures? What two way processes are in place? One often gets the feeling that many of these task forces and other bodies are operating outside existing structures and the level of information available to elected representatives can be quite scarce. I am not suggesting the task forces are not performing a worthwhile job but it is important and necessary that they are linked into existing structures so elected representatives will be aware of the type of work being done and what is available. There should be ongoing consultation for the benefit of all, as distinct from simply political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raises an important issue which came to my attention when I was assigned this role in July 1997. There appeared to be a gap between local drugs task forces and the political structure, that is, the local authority and <Col N="66" /> Members of this House. I issued instructions some time ago that all local drugs task forces should invite local elected representatives and Members of the Dáil, should they wish to become involved, to join the task forces and that the task forces should adopt, as a matter of policy, a mechanism whereby they could regularly inform local elected representatives about the work in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and in the context of reform of local government, to move local development and the national drugs strategy closer to local government so the two can operate with a degree of harmony. Most Members of the House would welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State concurs with my views on the level of contact. To be honest, I have not seen any great improvement. That is not to contradict the Minister of State or criticise his efforts in this regard. I urge him to be vigilant. It is important that these task forces operate within the structure of local government which is in touch with other local organisations such as football clubs and so forth, as the Minister of State is aware after serving for many years on a local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise that matter with the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the outcome of the negotiations with the Department of Education and Science? Has the Department agreed to be represented on the drugs task forces? Is the Minister of State aware of any new areas outside Dublin where heroin is becoming a serious problem? It would be a matter of concern to the task force if reports in the media are accurate that areas outside Dublin, that had not previously experienced a heroin problem, are beginning to see such a problem emerge.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a task force in my constituency. The task forces are operating very well and are involving local representatives, certainly in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to confirm that the Department of Education and Science has agreed to formal membership of the local drugs task forces. This is something I have been working on for some time with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. The vocational education committees have been very much involved not only in task force areas but also in other urban areas by supporting the work of the local drugs task forces and the young peoples' facilities and <Col N="67" /> services funds. We appreciate that commitment. The Department of Education and Science has undertaken to become formally part of the local drugs task forces and that is a positive step.</P>
      <P>With regard to concern about the emergence of the use of heroin outside the areas covered by the 14 local drugs task forces, Bray is the area we identified. For that reason we decided to create a new local drugs task force in the Bray area. The process of establishing that task force &ndash; funding has already been allocated &ndash; is now under way. We constantly monitor other areas for the emergence of a heroin problem. According to Garda Síochána figures which relate to 1998 &ndash; I accept that they are a year old &ndash; 93 per cent of crimes associated with heroin addiction occurred within the greater Dublin area. However, we are continuously concerned about the possibility of heroin use developing in areas other than those covered by the local drugs task forces. For that reason we continue to expand the role and remit of the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of recent surveys which indicate that 60 per cent of young people under 24 years of age use cannabis as their social drug of choice? That is higher than the use of alcohol among the same group. Given that the use of such drugs places people in the market for hard drugs as well, will he consider decriminalising the use of cannabis? It is not sustainable to have 60 per cent of the country's young people criminalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I will never put forward a proposal that cannabis should be decriminalised. I have considered the arguments on this issue &ndash; it is discussed from time to time &ndash; and the best advice available is that cannabis can be a gateway to hard drugs, although not in all circumstances. We do not yet know about the long-term effects the constant use of cannabis can have. There are different views on it but there is not yet sufficient information to suggest that the continuous use of cannabis is not a harmful practice. If the Government were to decriminalise the use of cannabis, it would send the wrong signal to young people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in the UK is very different from ours. The concern there centres on the fact that Railtrack, the private company which owns the railway infrastructure, also has responsibility for regulating safety in respect of the train operating companies. It is this safety regulatory responsibility that is to be removed from Railtrack. While the circumstances in both countries are not the same, my Department is keeping close contact with developments in the UK.</P>
      <P>The independent review of railway safety in Ireland identified a number of options for the future regulation of railway safety in Ireland. My Department is currently considering these options and is in consultation with the Health and Safety Authority, CIE and the trade unions, prior to preparing proposals for new railway safety laegislation. I would also welcome the views of Members of this House on the issue, particularly on the options put forward in the IRMS report.</P>
      <P>I hope to be able to make a statement outlining the likely future direction of railway safety regulation before the end of this year. However, it is not my intention to diminish the primary responsibility of Iarnród Éireann to operate a safe railway. The main issues being addressed in my Department's review are the form and content of the new regulatory regime and the body which will be responsible for safety regulation.</P>
      <P>I wish to formally extend my condolences to the families and friends of those who died in that awful rail crash. I had the opportunity to do so the day after the crash at a Council of Transport Ministers meeting in Europe but I also wish to do so in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to be associated with that vote of condolence to all those concerned in respect of that horrific tragedy.</P>
      <P>The previous debate on rail safety arising out of the incident at Knockcroghery has related mostly to derailments. The accident at Paddington occurred as a result of a train going through a red light and crashing into another train. That was the second such horrific incident. Does the Minister have statistics on how many trains here have gone through a red light over the past 12 months? An autonomic breaking system, ATP, is to be introduced in the UK. Has she any plans <i>vis-à-vis </i>rail safety to introduce an ATP system in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While there have been only interim reviews of what happened at Paddington that day, the accident appears to have been caused as a result of one train breaking a red <Col N="69" /> light. I do not have information with me as to how many such incidents have occurred here, but I can find that out for the Deputy from the railway safety officers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose has tabled a question on the £80 million worth of work that has been carried out on the continuous welded track, signalling, banks, bridges, railway crossings and on various other matters this year. Following the incident at Knockcroghery, we tended to concentrate work on the continuous welded track and that is quite proper. There are many other issues involved and signalling forms a strong part of the independent review study on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the introduction of an ATP system here and I will report back to him on that. Much of the debate in the UK has focused on Railtrack, the private company that owns the rail lines. Questions have arisen in interviews about it on many Channel 4 programmes and other programmes. Railtrack also has responsibility for regulating safety in respect of train operating companies. Much of the debate has centred on whether that is the correct mix and that gives rise to many questions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked how many incidents have arisen as a result of a train here going through a red light. Such an offence would come to light only if an incident occurred as a result of it. He also asked about the introduction of an ATP system and I will report back to him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she is conducting a review of rail safety legislation and that the day to day responsibility for rail safety lies with Iarnród Éireann, which is correct. There is an inherent conflict of interest in it being an operator and a regulator of rail safety. It is trying to obtain the maximum revenue and this relates to the overcrowding issue. This conflict of interest should be removed. This could be achieved by an equivalent of the HSAI or an adjunct of it being independently responsible for rail safety and answerable to the Minister. Commuters should be assured that a body is independently monitoring rail safety, overcrowding, level crossing safety and all the other issues involved and such a body should produce interim reports and an annual report.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent media reports about a possible capacity shortfall. I am informed by the ESB that there is sufficient capacity to meet our winter electricity needs. On this basis, I do not consider that there is a serious imminent risk of power cuts.</P>
      <P>The ESB has responsibility currently for ensuring that electricity demand is met. The company has approximately 4,325 megawatts of installed capacity, which will rise to 4,485 megawatts when the final phase of the Poolbeg plant comes into operation at the end of this year. This compares with the expected winter peak electricity demand of 3,700 megawatts.</P>
      <P>Continuing growth in the economy has led to an unprecedented demand for electricity. This increase in demand means that new generation capacity, beyond that which is already under construction, will be required by 2001. While there are projects in the pipeline by ESB and others, the ESB is successfully managing the increased demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 26 October 1999, it is important not only for the introduction of competition in the electricity industry but also for the economy's growing needs that new electricity generating capacity is brought onstream at an early date. Until the planning processes are completed, no further movement can take place regarding the construction of new plant.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the ESB was told a planning decision on its application would be made in August and Viridian was told a decision on its application would be made in September, but it has now been told one decision will be made in January and the other will be made in February. An Bord Pleanála is an independent body and it has a job to do. I do not want to comment on its decisions. The only comment I will make is that this is a matter of national interest and it has deferred it decisions on these applications for five months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware and did the ESB not tell her that amber alerts are now a regular occurrence and that a number of red alerts in the system have occurred? Is she aware that when a red alert occurs we are near to a closedown of a whole section, machinery in factories that require full load trip out and stop production, and that has already occurred? My source for this information is the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Will the Minister confirm that the interconnector to Northern Ireland is a necessity for the level of supply that is required to keep the economy operating? Will she agree it is a very vulnerable supply? Given that security of supply is essential, will she agree she was wrong earlier in the year in refusing to give authority to the ESB to proceed with its planning and with the development of further capacity? She still has not given the financial go ahead to the ESB to enable it build the power station that is the subject of the planning process?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about this, the ESB got the go ahead to apply for planning, which it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That was for planning only. The Minister did not give it the financial sanction that she must give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me complete my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot influence the decisions of An Bord Pleanála. It was to give its decision on the ESB's planning application in August but that decision has been deferred until January. I had no hand, act or part in that. I have spoken publicly about it and said that while I cannot influence a decision of An Bord Pleanála, where a matter is one of national interest I seek to influence a timely decision so that people can know the position in regard to power supply. I will continue to make that point. I gave the ESB permission to apply for planning, but it cannot proceed until it gets a decision on its application. It is as if it is in a timewarp, so to speak. It must wait six months beyond the projected date for this decision and there is nothing I can do about that.</P>
      <P>I was aware this question was tabled and while I have regular meetings with the chairman of the ESB, I had a meeting with him yesterday at which I raised the issue of amber alerts and red alerts which have been reported in the newspapers. He made it clear that the company's capacity of 4,485 megawatts is sufficient to meet winter electricity needs and the winter demand will be 3,700 megawatts.</P>
      <P>The delay in giving a decision is leading to worries and fears. If a favourable decision is reached, they should be ready to proceed without any undue delay and that is what we must be ready for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that we are now dependent on the interconnector between the Republic and Northern Ireland to ensure we have a continuous supply? Does she agree it is a vulnerable source of supply given that it has been blown up regularly by the IRA over the years and <Col N="72" /> that the IRA could start blowing it up again at any time? Does she agree it is not tenable to continue in this way? </P>
      <P>Is she aware there is only a vexatious appeal which has nothing to do with energy, by Zoe Developments against the ESB's planning application? While I am not asking the Minister to intervene in the decision&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman informed me that Zoe Developments is the only objector, which is interesting. It was announced on 28 October 1999 that the capacity on the Scotland to Northern Ireland interconnector will be doubled from 250 to 500 megawatts. I agree with the Deputy that it is a vulnerable source of supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was aware of media reports that she was bringing forward a proposal to increase fares by 10 per cent. Did she modify her proposal or did the Cabinet sanction only part of it? She was quick to differentiate between her role and that of the Cabinet at a meeting earlier this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It forced her to reduce them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Were the Minister's wings clipped or did she clip her proposal beforehand? </P>
      <P>The consistent views of commuters is that we have the lowest level of subvention of any European capital. Has the Minister made any proposal to Cabinet about the subvention for Dublin Bus? Her rhetoric is to encourage people to get out of their cars and to take the bus. Will she give a meaningful incentive to do that by increasing the subvention for Dublin Bus? I understand the subvention is 3.38p per passenger journey, which is the lowest of any European capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by asking if my wings were clipped. The memorandum I brought to Cabinet was accepted. The request from CIE was for double the increase I put forward. Those facts can be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. I brought to Cabinet the request from CIE and my proposals, which were accepted. Fares will be increased by 5p, although some will be increased by more than that. The last general fare increase was in 1991, although some fares were increased five years ago when Fianna Fáil and Labour were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked me about the subvention for <Col N="76" /> Dublin Bus. I discussed that with the Minister for Finance at the Estimates meeting. I brought forward proposals which will be evident in the Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that to increase charges for public transport at a time when the Minister is doing her best to increase the amount and efficiency of public transport is counter-productive? Has she looked at other European countries where public transport is the norm? In Dublin, for example, 94 per cent of the cost of running the Dublin Bus service is recovered from the passengers, whereas in Rome 24 per cent is recovered from the passengers. Does she agree that while Bus Éireann needs the money, it would be a preferable form of taxation to directly subsidise the company to encourage people to leave their cars at home and to use public transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The case put forward by the Deputy is plausible. However, it is unusual for a public service transport company not to increase its fares in nine years when wages have increased by at least 25 per cent in the same period. I have asked officials in the Department to ascertain comparable levels. I want more people to use public transport. The quality bus corridor in Stillorgan is a huge success because there are new buses and the journey time is shorter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because everyone else is stuck in one lane of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone laughed at me when I said I wanted to see people in shining new buses looking out at people gritting their teeth in cars, but that is what is happening. The number of new buses was increased last year and Deputy Stagg publicly acknowledged that. There will be more new buses from 2000 onwards. I hope the modest increase in fares will bring in further revenue. We must change our view that public transport is the fag end of transport and realise it is the right way to travel, particularly in urban areas. I will continue to make the case that good, accessible and attractive public transport is the best inducement to people to leave their cars at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has tried to sell this as a modest 5p increase. However, it is more than that. The minimum fare will be increased by 5p but most people will pay an increase of 10p or 20p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 5p per mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she received a request for an increase in fees a year ago. One of the reasons she said she was holding off was that she wanted CIE to put in place public service contracts. Is that being done at the same time as these fares are being increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The fare increases and the public service contracts were before Cabinet. A <Col N="77" /> decision has been made on one but not on the other, although I expect a decision will be made on that matter next week. The fares are for the three companies. The details of the public service contracts are almost agreed for Bus Átha Cliath but that matter remains to be settled at Cabinet. The Deputy will see from the tabular statement that the increase is 5p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister that Stillorgan is not the only place with a quality bus corridor.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lucan bus corridor is working well and I am sure the Minister sees that when she is stuck in her State car. It took me two hours to travel 15 miles this morning. Does the Minister agree that we are not talking about the 5p or 5 per cent increase but about the trend?</P>
      <P>The Government continually says the bus company must pay its way but that makes it unattractive to the customer because the cost is too high. If we are to bring that to its logical conclusion we should say it should make a profit. When we tried that before, people did not use the buses and there was not any money to buy new buses. It is a vicious circle. Does the Minister agree that rather than increasing fares she should offer incentives to the car travelling public to leave their cars behind? She might consider having six months free travel for new customers just as we do not have airport charges for new passengers for ten years. The Minister might look at the Michael O'Leary model for the buses and stop the trend of overcharging. She should seriously consider having zero fares for certain categories of travellers, particularly on new routes, to encourage people to use them and have buses in place as quickly as possible to cater for the rush of passengers which I am sure would result if that were the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the traffic <Col N="78" /> jams in Dublin are costing commerce in the city £1.5 billion per year? We pay £5 million to Dublin Bus and it would pay this city and the economy to seriously increase the amount of money we pay directly from the Exchequer for public transport. When the next tranche of funds is due will the Minister look at the £1.5 billion we are losing and see how that could be reduced by giving a direct subsidy to the transport companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that Bus Átha Cliath would make a profit. That notion was abroad for some time. The subsidy must be kept within reasonable bounds. The mix of endeavouring to fund and produce a good public transport system with good infrastructure and at the same time keep fares reasonable is a difficult one to balance.</P>

      <Quest>if she will initiate discussions with her counterpart in the North on the best utilisation of the Corrib field to mutual advantage, north and south, in view of the contention of an exploration company (details supplied) that the Corrib field could meet up to 50 per cent of the total demand for gas until well into the next century; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21891/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department maintains contact on an ongoing basis with the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland in relation to matters of mutual interest. As energy markets are opened to competition in accordance with the European Union single market programme it is inevitable that there will be an increasing integration and interdependence between the energy markets north and south.</P>
      <P>It was for this reason that the Department of Economic Development in Belfast was invited, in an observer capacity, to participate in the study carried out by my Department and Bord Gáis Eireann in relation to the infrastructure options to meet future gas demand until 2025. This &ldquo;Gas 2025&rdquo; study considered a number of gas supply options and concluded that the optimal solution on cost and other grounds for the future incremental supply of the northern and southern markets with gas from or through the UK would be to replicate the existing Moffat-Loughshinny pipeline without incorporating a North-South link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An economic analysis subsequently commissioned by my Department of the various Gas 2025 options also had regard to the changing circumstances since the Gas 2025 study was launched, in particular developments in relation to the Corrib field and a proposal for a Belfast/Dublin gas pipeline. This analysis confirmed the findings of the Gas 2025 study but concluded that a commitment should not be made to <Col N="79" /> future infrastructure pending further clarification of the potential of the Corrib discovery. Supply constraint considerations will require that key decisions be taken next year. The report of the economic analysis and other relevant material is on my Department's website.</P>
    <P>The potential impact of Corrib is dependent, in the first instance, on the actual size of the discovery and, in the second, on a decision by the owners on the means by which the field will be developed commercially. This will require clarity in relation to the possible landing points and pipeline routing options. It is premature to say whether a north-south link might be an economic prospect as a part of any new pipeline configuration required to exploit the discovery.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that a third appraisal well will be drilled in the Corrib field early next year before a decision will be taken on the commercial development of the field. In circumstances where this decision has not yet been taken, I have to look upon suggestions that the field could meet up to 50 per cent of the total demand for gas until well into the next century as an exciting prospect but unduly speculative as a basis for a formal bilateral initiative of the kind envisaged by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland will continue to maintain close contact in this matter. I am open to meeting my Northern Ireland counterpart, as necessary, in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to that reply I wonder if it is possible that there is less enthusiasm and commitment on the part of this Government to an all-Ireland energy market than there is on the part of the British Government and the Northern Ireland Office. Is the Minister aware of the document issued by the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland entitled &ldquo;Strategy 2010&rdquo; where it is recommended that future energy investment decisions should be made in an island of Ireland energy market; machinery for its creation should be established as a priority and they should best examine how such a market could be established?

      <P>Is the Minister telling us that the British Government and the Northern Ireland Office see this as a priority whereas he and his Department do not? What is his response to the Northern Ireland proposals for the establishment of a steering group, possibly under joint ministerial control north and south, to consider the implications of an all-Ireland market? Will he tell us his response to the proposal that the strategy group prepares a preliminary report by February next year? What is his response to the proposal <Col N="80" /> by the Minister for the Economy in the North that there should be a joint action plan for publication by February 2001 on the agreed steps to create an all-Ireland energy plan?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recollect, I announced in mid-September my proposal to publish a discussion document on governance and accountability arrangements in the regulatory process in relation to the sectors which come within the ambit of my Department. I invited comments from the public in the context of the discussion document and these submissions are now being received. At the request of a number of parties, I have decided to extend the deadline for receipt of submissions until 30 November 1999.</P>
      <P>The time is right to launch a discussion on governance and accountability issues, drawing on the experience gained to date. In particular, I intend that the discussion document will address the following aspects of the regulatory process: the relationship between regulators and Ministers, the Oireachtas, the courts and the general public; the responsibility of regulators to look after consumer interests; overlapping jurisdictional issues; enforcement of a regulatory framework; adequacy of current statutory arrangements on the impartiality and transparency of procedures and decision-making processes of regulators; and whether the regulatory authority in each sector should comprise one individual regulator or a regulatory board.</P>
      <P>I do not have specific proposals for the establishment of a super regulator. However, I am committed to reviewing the arrangements for the accountability of regulators in the public enterprise sectors.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it was reported during the summer &ndash; it may have been the silly season &ndash; that she was contemplating the establishment of a super regulator to regulate the regulators? Perhaps she can clarify that. Is she aware of the common perception that many assistant secretaries in her Department are becoming regulators and that the position of super regulator may be seen as a job lined up for the retiring secretary of the Department&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that this is seen as decentralisation of the Department? As the Minister knows, I have had serious disagreements with the OTDR on a third mobile licence. A question on <Col N="82" /> this matter I tabled to the Minister was ruled out of order. To whom is the director accountable? If she, in my opinion, makes an administrative error or error of judgment &ndash; I am not asking the Minister to agree or disagree with that &ndash; to whom can one turn? The Minister is accountable to this House. To whom are regulators accountable for their performance?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that there was a great deal of discussion about regulators when we dealt with the electricity regulation legislation. I thought about this until the end of August and we then sent out invitations to comment. I did not use the words &ldquo;super regulator&rdquo;, but it was couched in those terms in the newspapers the following morning. I corrected this in an interview with Geraldine Harney on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and stated that it is my belief the country is too small for a super regulator. It is small enough for the proposed number of regulators who will be bumping into one another.</P>
      <P>A regulator reports to no one. I hold informal meetings with Etain Doyle&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree the telecommunications regulatory legislation is faulty in so far as the Minister of State guided it through the Dáil. I am sure she will agree the telecommunications regulator is not responsible to anybody and that the legislation needs to be changed. The review of the regulatory position is welcome. It behoves all of us to have an input into that review so we can create a system of regulating competition where the regulator is not the policy maker nor an independent power. I welcome the Minister's decision in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. There was much discussion during the electricity regulation legislation, which provides for a commission rather than one person. It was a new field for this country and it had to evolve. It has evolved and gaps now need to be filled. The question is clear &ndash; who guards the guards? We are responsible. No matter what people say about politicians, we go to the electorate and they vote us in or out. Various mechanisms need to put in <Col N="83" /> place as regards the position of regulator. That is not a reflection on Etain Doyle or anyone else &ndash; it must be done before we are overrun with regulators and there are no remaining policy issues for the House to address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Moynihan-Cronin will know &ndash; she was part of a delegation which made recent representations on this matter &ndash; the board of Aer Rianta submitted a report to me on 15 April last on the future strategic direction of the company in which they sought the authority to exit from the Great Southern Hotels in a manner determined through a consultative process with the relevant stakeholders. Over the past few months I have met and consulted with the staff of all the Great Southern Hotels. I advised them that my main consideration would be to find the right future for the Great Southern Hotels in a way that will be right for the staff and for the Irish tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The board of Aer Rianta has retained Arthur Andersen consultants to examine all the options for the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group. It recently appointed Mr. Phil Flynn to act as facilitator with the trade unions as part of the process. As I said a couple of weeks ago, it is expected that this examination will be completed shortly and brought to Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. She is aware that consultants have been examining this matter for six months. At the meeting of the public enterprise and transport committee this morning, the Minister said the matter would be decided by the Cabinet within three weeks. As a decision is imminent, the Minister must have a clear idea of the direction the Great Southern Hotels Group will take. Will another body, such as CERT, be considered as a possible owner for the hotels, thus keeping them in public ownership? Will the Minister also take into consideration a motion passed at last month's SIPTU conference, stating the hotels should stay in public ownership. As SIPTU represents the majority of staff employed by the group, this represents an overwhelming percentage who wants the hotels kept in public ownership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not consulted CERT. I was aware through media reports of the SIPTU debate and the motion which the Deputy says was passed. I hope that by the end of November the report on this matter, which would be part of the general Aer Rianta report, will be going to Cabinet.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being extremely coy on this issue. Will the Minister confirm that she has prepared a memorandum for observations, which has been circulated to other Departments, which says that the Great Southern Hotel Group should be sold? There was a media leak to that effect last week in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Having toured the eight Great Southern Hotels, all the Minister has to offer the staff is tea and sympathy, and precious little else.</P>

      <P>Wait now, let me finish. The Deputy cannot make an assertion like that in the House when it is untrue. It is absolutely untrue. The Deputy can put in a Freedom of Information Act request tonight and I will reply tomorrow that, as of now, there is no memorandum circulating for observations to any Government Department on the Great Southern Hotels. This morning, when I gave my view on everything, other Members &ndash; not the Deputy &ndash; said I was wrong to do so. The Deputy cannot have it every way.</P>

      <P>Hopefully, at the end of November we will all know. Since the Minister has not made up her mind on the matter, will she approach CERT about this? Why is the Minister saying no to the option that the group could fund an investment from its own resources? We are all aware that Aer Rianta will not invest in the hotels even though they require such investment. The hotels are in a position to do it themselves and they could stay together under CERT as a public body. Will the Minister consider that option?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister bringing information, which is what we are seeking, on the realisable revenue, either in terms of a revenue stream or in the realisable capital value, to Cabinet? I would understand it if she were bringing to Cabinet a proposal to sell property. Will the Minister outline the relevant figure? There were some musings last year during the Luas debacle that a sum of £400 million could be raised. I said it would be closer to a £25 million to £40 million revenue stream. Will the Minister indicate the figure which is likely to be realised? Will she outline the broad parameters of the likely stream of income or saleable value of the property? Will she admit she totally overestimated what was possible in this regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that was the case. The delay has been caused by the need to clarify what is realisable from sales and in terms of stream of income or leverage from other revenue. The discussions have centred on that aspect and on the large property portfolio regarding the proposed convention centre. I understand difficulties have been encountered with regard to that matter, although they are not planning issues. The property portfolio is composed of many things and it is, as I thought, considerable.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister has a draft report from Sherry FitzGerald, will she tell us the ballpark figure contained in it? The Minister has that information and I am entitled to ask for it.

This depends on imminent future developments and it is holding up the final assessment of the property portfolio. I have no difficulty giving the Deputy that information.</P>

      <P>As there appears to be a misunderstanding regarding what amendment No. 26 is designed to achieve, it would be helpful to give a fuller explanation in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, which took place on 21 July, I indicated in respect of section 47 that certain matters had been brought to our attention on which I had not had time to reflect before Committee Stage but which appeared to warrant more detailed consideration. A Law Society submission on the Bill, dated 16 June 1999, gave rise to that indication. Many of the points raised by the Law Society supported the direction of the Bill. Some other points raised queries on the provisions but, having considered them, it was decided not to make adjustments. However, in respect of section 47, two of the issues in particular appeared to merit further examination. I was <Col N="94" /> unable to complete that examination before Committee Stage and, accordingly, I flagged the possibility of returning to section 47 on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 43 and 47 deal with notifications that must or can be made to the Companies Registration Office by certain parties. In the case of section 43, the obligation is specifically imposed on the existing person who is the Irish resident director where that person ceases to be a director and there is no other person who meets the obligation of every company having an Irish resident director. In the context of section 47, changes were proposed to section 195 of the Companies Act, 1963, in relation to notifications to be made where a person ceases to be a director. This applies in all circumstances and not only in relation to the person who fulfils the role of the resident Irish director of an Irish registered company.</P>
    <P>In the context of the amendments to section 47, the Law Society pointed out that the notification which is being made by a resigning director may operate in circumstances where there is an insolvency or other adverse circumstances. In this instance, it suggested that there was a need for a saver concerning the possibility of defamation. That is essentially the new section 11D being inserted by amendment No. 32 which we will reach later. When that amendment was being prepared it was considered that a similar concern could arise in respect of notifications made pursuant to section 43, Part IX of the Bill.</P>
    <P>To illustrate this by way of an example, as Deputy Rabbitte requested, it could happen that a person would honestly believe he or she was the last resident director of a company, cease to hold that position and make a notification to the Companies Registration Office not knowing another director of the company met the residency requirements set out in section 44, Part VIII, which it is proposed to amend in amendment No. 27. In such circumstances, the remaining director may feel his or her rights have been infringed or his or her good name impugned. While I appreciate that the notification of a person ceasing to be a director is made with his or her knowledge, it was considered that in the interests of ensuring directors comply with this obligation, we should provide the support of this additional saver. That is the reason for the amendment. I hope this clarifies matters.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question it is important I try, as far as I can, to provide an illustration of what might prevail. Say that a well known Irishman, Pat Rabbitte, owned a company called Pat Rabbitte International. He acquires other companies throughout the world but Pat Rabbitte International is the controlling company. Pat Rabbitte may have homes in Ireland, Monaco, Paris, Acapulco or wherever and he could be in and out of the country on many occasions, as are many big business people. There may be a doubt among certain State agencies as to whether he meets the residency requirement <Col N="95" /> under either company or taxation law. Another nominated person may have fully met them and he notifies the company's secretary he is resigning from the company. Following acceptance of this amendment this person will be obliged to notify the Companies Registration Office. In that instance Pat Rabbitte, who is the chief executive and a well known Irishman, publicly acknowledged for his contribution, may consider that his rights have been impugned in some way because he believes he is <i>de facto</i> resident in the country even though other State agencies may, for various reasons, consider he is not. This provision is proposed to address that situation and to protect the rights of each individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure matters are clearer. The Minister of State's language made me think of the adage &ldquo;will the last person leaving the world turn off the lights&rdquo;. I understand the submission to which the Minster of State refers was made by the Law Society. This means it has been made on behalf of solicitors who are, by and large, the people who will register these companies. They are concerned that if a resident director resigns somebody unknown to that person may claim to be still a director.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will recall I asked if this provision would allow a secretary, cleaning lady or somebody else to be listed as a company director to which he responded the director would have to know what the company was about. Why would a director, who is a resident director for the purpose of registering this company and knows what the company is about, know nothing about some other person such as the fictitious Pat Rabbitte referred to by the Minister of State, who, as a director, fulfils the rules with regard to residency? How much does the person offering his resignation know about the company of which he is supposed to be a director? I understand that one could not be made a director in ignorance of what was happening, as has happened where solicitors' secretaries are appointed company directors.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer, but I cannot understand in legal terms the position of the fictitious person described by the Minster of State, who is a resident in Ireland but also lives in Monaco, Acapulco and other places. If I am a director, my name is on the board of directors and I am an Irish resident when the company was established. If I decide to resign my directorship and I declare in a statement that, to the best of my knowledge, I am the only Irish resident director of the company, how does the statement of that fact lead a director, such as the fictitious Pat Rabbitte, to say he has been defamed?</P>
      <P>It would be understandable if a person resigned because the company was engaged in fraudulent activity, yet section 43(9) states:</P>
      <P>.if a person ceases to be a director of a company, and at the time of that cessation&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> (<i>a</i>) he or she is resident in the State, and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) to his or her knowledge, no other director of the company is resident in the State,</P>
    <P>that person shall, within 14 days after that cessation, notify, in writing, the registrar of companies of that cessation and the matter referred to in <i>paragraph (b).</i>The directors do not have to say they are resigning because they believe somebody is cooking the books or engaged in money laundering, the company is a sham or people lied to establish it. They are only required to notify the registrar of their cessation as director and whether, to their knowledge, no other director is resident in the State. How could a lawyer say in court that the mere statement of that fact is defamatory to some unknown resident director? Perhaps others on this side of the House may understand that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State owes the House further elaboration of the arguments put forward by the Law Society. I did not receive its submission and I do not know whether copies were sent to Deputy Rabbitte or Deputy Perry. Having prepared a submission for the Minister, the society should know it would be a good idea to furnish a copy to the Opposition. This legislation is not political &ndash; we all want to agree to changes that improve company law. It was a mistake on the part of the society not to furnish me with a copy of its submission and I will advise it of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State owes the House an elaboration of the rationale behind the Law Society's argument for including only this aspect of its submission in this amendment. I understand the society made a long submission. I did not hear the Minster of State refer to it previously so I presume he has only incorporated this aspect in the legislation. If so, we are owed more of an explanation as to how the great lawyers of the land would be able to construe defamation out of a statement by a resigning director that, to his knowledge, he is the only Irish resident director. Not even the most meticulous analysis of such a declaration could show it to be defamatory.</P>
    <P>What happens to a company that is left without a bond or a resident director? Is there an onus on someone to resubmit a new name of a director or to enter into negotiation to replace the resident director with the bond? On reading the Bill, it does not indicate to me that as soon as a director resigns the company folds and must close its doors. This is another reason the Minister of State's explanation is still not clear. If it were the case that as soon as a director resigned and there was no director resident in Ireland the company shut down and a notice appeared in the newspapers stating that the company was being closed down, perhaps at that stage implications for a person would begin to be defamatory. The Minister should give a better reason for including this section if no action is taken immediately after a director resigns that could be construed as defamatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the illustration he has given. Deputy Owen's questions are entirely reasonable because it still is not apparent why the action of resigning could leave the director open to defamation actions. I can understand how a situation could give rise to defamation whereby the last resident director is resigning and required to notify in the fashion set out here, and if he or she were to say in a letter that the other members of the board, when they fly back to London or whatever, are meeting behind his or her back and have been up to no good and because of various nefarious purposes he or she is resigning. However, if the only action here is to advise of the fact of resignation, I am not clear on how defamation arises. Are we being overly punctilious or is there a substantive argument? What is the answer to Deputy Owen's first question? What sort of company in the modern world would not know the domicile of the members of the board of directors? I had the unique privilege in recent weeks of having a number of boards of directors appear before me. They were a bit hazy on some issues but they were not hazy on the domicile of the directors, whether it be in Monaco or Australia, or outside or within this jurisdiction. There did not seem to be a problem about this; everyone knew where they stood on the issue. Is it a reasonable presumption that members of the board would know the domicile of their colleagues on the board? They might not know their entire <i>curriculum vitae</i> but one would think it a reasonable assumption that if one is joining a board, even if this is for the purposes of decorating the notepaper, one would know who they are joining and so on. I am not sure that a great deal turns on this at the end of the day. This is not nearly as important as the earlier decision to capitulate to the banks in terms of the lessor and leasing issue. There must be a more substantive argument to support this proposal, otherwise we are now becoming so punctilious that we provide for every eventuality. I would like to once again hear the Minister of State's views on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear earlier and I want to make it clear again that one can only be prevented from becoming a director of a company if he or she is debarred under section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990 or is declared bankrupt. The same applies throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>There are nine pages in the submission received from the Law Society which is dated 16 June and was received on 20 June. Section 47 reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee welcomes the long overdue implementation, even with amendments, of legislation to assist honest directors keep the companies registration office details up to date where the company has failed to do so. That said, we have some important reservations on the subject of the amendments to the principle <Col N="98" /> approved by the Oireachtas 9 years ago that directors should be entitled to notify their resignations.</P>
    <P>The first reservation concerns the obligation on a director to seek to state who the directors are at the time he comes to notify his having resigned or otherwise ceased to be a director.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the subsection (11A) to be inserted, at subparagraph (f2&gt;b)(i) delete &ldquo;are officers of the company&rdquo; and insert instead:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;were officers of the company at the time the director or secretary, as the case may be, ceased to be director or secretary of the company&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second reservation concerns defamation. Where a resigning director is giving notice of a resignation it is possible that he or she will be doing so in circumstances where there is an insolvency or other adverse circumstances. [ I have already referred to that].</P>
    <P>Therefore, insert a new subsection (11C) (renumbering accordingly): </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in any documentation forwarded to the registrar in conformity with subsection (11B) shall of itself be or be deemed to be defamatory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Rabbitte's point about directors knowing the addresses of their fellow directors is relevant. What is wrong with what is being proposed? We are proposing that the resident director should notify the Companies Registration Office at the same time as that person notifies the secretary of the board of the company of which that person is a director that he or she is no longer the resident director of the company. Otherwise how will the Companies Registration Office know this person has resigned?</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is probably correct. We probably are being over cautious but that is the reason for the amendment. We want to keep in line with section 47 of the present Bill. Under section 43(14) the Companies Registration Office can move to strike off the company. If there is a resignation and there is no resident director to the knowledge of the Companies Registration Office, then they can move to strike off the company. This provision enables a more smooth, effective and professional dealing with the matter. It puts the onus on the resident director to ensure that if he or she resigns they will notify the Companies Registration Office. If they do not do so, they are liable jointly and separately with the company for anything that goes wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already included in the Bill. I am making the point that what is proposed is perhaps cautious and overly careful. It puts the onus on a resident director whom we want to know exists. When he or she resigns we want the Companies Registration Office to be aware at all times of the registration. I see nothing wrong with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is missing the point; I am not questioning section 43(9). This is included in the Bill and I accept the need for subsection (9) which states, &ldquo;Without prejudice to anything in section 195 (as amended) .. if a person ceases to be a director of a company and, at the time of that cessation (f2&gt;a) he or she is resident in the State, and (f2&gt;b) to his or her knowledge, no other director of the company is resident in the State, that person shall, within 14 days after that cessation, notify in writing, the registrar, etc. etc.&rdquo;. We have no problem with this but I wish the Minister of State would understand our confusion. He keeps saying that there is nothing wrong with asking people to make a submission on resigning. No one is questioning this. Given what the Law Society said, what advice did the Minister of State take? The amendment refers to &ldquo;a notification in writing to the registrar of companies of the matter referred to in <i>subsection (9)(b)</i>&rdquo;. That subsection reads: &ldquo;to his or her knowledge, no other director of the company is resident in the State&rdquo;. The amendment effectively states that, if a person sends a letter stating that, to the best of his knowledge, he is the director resident in the State, it shall not be regarded as constituting defamatory matter. Who says that it does? What use does the Law Society believe could be made of that simple, straightforward statement by another director who happens to be resident in Ireland? Is it all supposition? If I say I am, to my knowledge, the only director resident in Ireland but there happens to be another and our company is engaged in fraudulent activity, does the society assume my resignation and the fact I say I know of no other resident director can be used in court by the other director saying I have defamed him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand. I could understand if such a stipulation were included after a clause requiring a director to give in writing his reasons for resigning and to outline if accounts had been written or made fraudulently, but to include it in this manner makes no sense. The Minister of State may say it may do no harm, but why include it if it is not needed? It gives the impression that a simple statement of fact that a person does not know there is another resident director is defamatory. That is turning law on its head. I am sorry if that is all the Law Society said in its statement about it, but it would not have been included without the Minister of State having had more discussion about it. Perhaps his officials have had more discussions and understand there is more to it. Perhaps the Law Society said to them that the act of resignation and a declaration of the nature referred to could be used in a defamation case. If <Col N="100" /> the Minister of State could tell me that, I would be satisfied, but I am not aware of it.</P>

      <P>We have difficulty in understanding the purpose of this amendment.

Is it possible that an injustice could be done to the remaining directors now that we are ringfencing the director who resigned from any action in the area of defamation, the purpose of which we have difficulty in understanding? Could the other directors be disadvantaged? Do we have to roll them in cotton wool or is it possible to explain why the director who resigns needs this type of protection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to keep sections 43 and 47 in line with each other. In addition, the purpose of this is to ensure that, in so far as we can, we copperfasten the law, regulations and systems to tie down IRNR companies. As a result of this Bill being passed, the law will require such companies to have a bona fide resident Irish director. We are now obliging that director, if he or she resigns, to notify the Companies Registration Office of his or her resignation. If that happens, the companies registrar will automatically notify the company secretary that the Companies Registration Office has received the resignation, that, as the company no longer has a resident director, it will be struck off and that it has a certain number of days to reply. That should result in the board of directors being summoned to a meeting to discuss the matter, and they would probably consult their lawyers and auditors which would result in a response. If someone at the meeting said that he was now resident having declared for tax in Ireland the previous year, how are other directors to know that is the position?</P>

The legal suggestion from the Law Society is that this could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not have meetings with the Law Society. We received its submission, the team dis<Col N="101" /> cussed it, they had their consultation, they talked to me, I agreed with what they were doing and the measure is now in place. We saw merit in the measure. We believed there may be a point to it.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and such a person is supposed to declare that, to his or her knowledge, no other director of the company is resident in the State. Such a director could resign and state there is no other resident director in the State, which could lead to publicity. For example, they could leak information to the effect that they resigned because the company was in trouble. If I were in the situation of having resigned and lied in saying that I thought there was no other resident director, I would receive additional protection from this amendment. It could happen that I could be taken to court by the other resident director, but I could claim under this new subsection that saying I was the only resident director protects me from the case taken against me. It could cosset a director who is &ldquo;doing the dirty&rdquo; on his or her fellow directors. That is a possible scenario and, if I were a lawyer for the other resident director, I would be annoyed if this section prevented me from suing the person who lied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unhappy about the amendment, but we have probably discussed it sufficiently for the benefit of barristers who may have to make a case <Col N="102" /> for a resident director against a director who lied. People fall out&mdash;</P>

    <P>(II) in the period of 12 months preceding the immediate 12 month period (&lsquo;the previous 12 month period'), for a period (being a period comprising in the aggregate the number of days on which the person is present in the State in the immediate 12 month period and the number of days on which the person was present in the State in the previous 12 month <Col N="103" /> period) in the aggregate amounting to 280 days or more,</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;b) that time is in a year of assessment (within the meaning of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997) in respect of which the person has made an election under section 819(3) of that Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The issue with which we are dealing here is the definition of when a person is to be regarded as resident in the State for the purposes of section 43. I indicated on Committee Stage that I would examine the adequacy of this definition prior to Report Stage in the light of a particular matter which had been brought to my attention. It had been pointed out to me that our definition did not contain the facility available in tax law to elect to be resident in the year of arrival and that the absence of this provision was likely to cause difficulties for seconded personnel arriving in Ireland from abroad who would be tax resident but would not be eligible to meet the company law requirements in the year of their arrival. Having consulted with the relevant parties in this matter, I have decided to table an amendment to subsection 8, the effect of which is to include in the definition the facility available in tax law of electing to be resident in the year of arrival. The definition now essentially corresponds with the definition in taxation law in this country.</P>
    <P>Amendment Nos. 28 and 29 are consequential technical amendments to section 44(9), arising from the amendments to the definition of residency in subsection 8. I commend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably a fair proposition that if people are paying tax in this jurisdiction, they should be regarded as resident if they elect to be so &ndash; in this legislation for the purposes of being a resident director. I examined section 819 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which relates to residence for tax purposes. Section 819(3) seems to be a particular sub-category which states that notwithstanding subsections 1 and 2, an individual who is not resident in the State for a year of assessment and to whom paragraph (f2&gt;b) applies may at any time elect to be treated as resident in the State for that year and, where an individual so elects, the individual shall, for the purposes of the Acts, be deemed to be resident in the State for that year. Presumably, that relates to someone coming to this jurisdiction from another jurisdiction who wants to work here but does not have the required number of days which would confer residency under the Acts. Under section 819(3), such a person can elect to be a resident of the State for tax purposes. The Minister is saying that similarly, such a person should be eligible to be the resident director and I find it difficult to argue with that.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to a technical point I raised on Committee Stage which I thought the Minister might have taken on board.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is somewhat of a belt and braces matter. I moved this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister said he would consider it. I wanted to ensure that the letter notifying people would actually arrive and that its receipt by the relevant person would be acknowledged. On Committee Stage, the Minister did not feel this provision needed to be included. Did he reconsider this matter? On Committee Stage he said: &ldquo;We have done other wonderful things but it may still be relevant . the registrar's letter must be sent and if it is a registered letter, the registrar will be satisfied it has been duly delivered.&rdquo;  I thought it would constitute an injustice if a letter was sent by registered post and was signed as having been received but was not actually received by the person in question. I was concerned that the deadline might have come and gone before the person <Col N="105" /> received notification of it. I made the point that the postal service is not always as reliable as it might be.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go out on a limb over this but I would like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that this provision does not need to be included. I am sure he and his officials went over all the points made on Committee Stage to ensure that no injustices would be created by sending people a letter informing them that they would be struck off or that something which might prove embarrassing to them was due to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

      <P>I want to make a point in regard to charitable and community based companies whose boards of directors might not meet very frequently. Most companies are limited by guarantee. I am aware of a case where a community based company was struck off because the secretary had resigned and the relevant correspondence was not passed on to the board of directors which would not meet as frequently as that of a normal trading company. Is there any derogation in that area? Community based companies, perhaps set up for the purpose of community development in an area, may meet only once or twice a year. Is any leeway given to companies which are not commercially driven but which have a company structure for litigation purposes?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 32 in the name of the Minister arises out of Committee proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 42, to delete line 39 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be considered by the registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(11D) No additional information referred to in subsection (11A)(f2&gt;b)(i) that is included in a notice of resignation or other documentary proof referred to in this section which is forwarded, under and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, to the registrar of com<Col N="106" /> panies shall, of itself, be regarded as constituting defamatory matter.</P>
    <P>(11E) Any person may give notice (accompanied by such proof of the matter concerned as may be prescribed) to the registrar of companies of the fact that a person holding the office of director or secretary of a particular company has died.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section is designed to overcome difficulties which would have arisen if section 195(8) of the 1963 Act, as inserted by section 51 of the Companies Act, 1990, were to be commenced. On Committee Stage I indicated that I would look further at this provision in advance of Report Stage arising from a submission made to me which was still under consideration when Committee Stage took place. Having considered the matter further, I now bring forward two amendments for consideration. The purpose of the first amendment, 11D, is to offer protection in instances where a notice of resignation is given and may give particulars of the officers appointed to the company but because the notifying former officer has left the company, this information may not always be 100 per cent accurate. The second amendment, 11E, is self-explanatory. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to constituting defamatory matter. I assume this is the extra part of that about which we had such long discussion. At least, in this instance, it makes a little more sense. The Minister will recall I said that if somebody is accused of defamation and had elaborated on the reason for resigning, one could see some argument for including a clause that that would not be defamatory. Again, I have a problem with it. The amendment states: &ldquo;No additional information referred to ... that is included in a notice of resignation ... which is forwarded, under and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, to the registrar of companies shall, of itself, be regarded as constituting defamatory matter.&rdquo;  What exactly does &ldquo;shall, of itself&rdquo; mean? </P>
      <P>Again, let us take the hypothetical director who abandons the sinking ship before the inspectors close in and who sends their notice of resignation with much documentation maligning somebody else in the company. Are we knowingly giving them the protection of the law in that they can say what they like to make themselves look good when the inspectors come in to look at this company which is going down the Swanee? It seems that an unfair extra protection is being given to one person &ndash; the first person to resign or a person who resigns &ndash; perhaps leaving others to fight a battle when the person who resigns might be the most guilty. By giving this extra protection to one person, it is imbalanced in favour of that person and against the person who might claim defamation. Have his advisers looked at that element of what he is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as relevant here as in the earlier part but <Col N="107" /> at least there is more reason to talk about defamation when a more elaborate complaint is made. There probably could be something in that which could be defamatory if it was proven to be untrue. Why did the Minister decide to give the weight of protection to the first person out of the sinking ship, if that is what is happening?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is very clear. Section 11D says that any additional information referred to in subsection (11A) &ndash; in other words, information which is included with the notice of resignation &ndash; the lodging of the documents in themselves cannot be regarded as constituting defamatory matter. In other words, the act of resigning and forwarding the documentation, as of themselves, will not defame anybody. Again, it gives an opportunity to comply. If the resident director complies, lodges and makes the information available to the Companies Registration Office, it means the notification going to the Companies Registration Office will have to give prescribed information. That has still to be done by regulation after the Bill is enacted. In other words, we have to decide exactly what prescribed information will be once the Bill is passed. That will be taken care of by way of regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to appear pedantic and to correct the Minister but he appears to be saying, although it is not what the amendment says, that the import of this amendment is that the act of sending in information will not be constituted as defamatory. The amendment states: &ldquo;No additional information ... [moving down to the active verb] shall, of itself, be regarded as constituting defamatory matter.&rdquo;  It is not the act of handing it in which is not defamatory; it is the information in the matter which one hands in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to say that the act of handing it in shall not, of itself, be considered defamatory. The act does not matter but rather the information being sent in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The information contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is not what I heard the Minister say. The additional information being sent in is being cleared of being allowed to be used in any case of defamation taken by this unknown director or other directors who may still exist in the company. We are talking about other directors who are not resident but are directors of the company who might be brought into this so-called defamation action in respect of something which a director has lodged. I assume this refers to the situation about which we talked earlier where the sole resident Irish director offers resignation and goes on to give more information as to why he or she has done so. In that instance, it could be claimed they were defaming all the other directors and that the <Col N="108" /> information cannot be used in an action of defamation. Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is not the action but the information itself. Does that mean the person who wants to take a defamation case has to go outside to find information? I could draw the analogy of the tribunals. We cannot take a case to court based on somebody saying something at the tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda or whoever wants to take a case must go independently and get other information to prove that somebody must face a criminal charge. If I, as a resigning director, give much information in one of these reports alleging wrongdoing by other directors of the company, it is protected by this law. If Deputy Rabbitte or another director wants to take a case against me because of what I said, they will have to make me say it somewhere else. Is that right?</P>

    <P>My explanation in respect of this amendment is somewhat long so I ask the House to bear with me while I explain the reasons for the changes and the different approach which is now proposed in respect of section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990. Deputies will recall that section 53 of the Bill was introduced by way of amendment on Committee Stage. When introducing the amendment I explained in some detail the reasons for the various changes to section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, which I was then making.</P>
    <P>In summary, what was being done was to extend the list of competent authorities to which disclosure may be made pursuant to subsection (1) of that section. Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides for the publication or disclosure of information that has been obtained under section 19 or 20 of that Act. Essentially, this arises under section 19 as a result of the Minister directly requesting or authorising an officer to obtain information from a company as a preliminary step to determine if any irregular activity may have been carried on, or under section 20, as a result of entry and search, on foot of a warrant issued by a district justice.</P>
    <P>The sections in question contain very specific <Col N="112" /> detail as to the matters that may be examined and the procedures to be followed. Arising from the debate on Committee Stage and the subsequent debate in this House on 29 and 30 September 1999 in relation to the motion on the Ansbacher investigation, we have re-examined section 21 in detail. Arising from that examination, I am bringing forward a comprehensive amendment to section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, which is now under consideration.</P>
    <P>Essentially, I am focusing primarily on the amendment of section 21(1), rather than section 21(3), which had been the focus of the previous amendments provided for in section 53. In doing this, the intention is to identify specifically not only the parties to which information may be disclosed but also to more clearly identify the reason for which disclosure to such parties may take place.</P>
    <P>The first amendment to be made in subsection (1) of section 20 of the 1990 Act is consequential on the subsequent amendment to section 21 (1)(f2&gt;a) and simply substitutes a correct cross reference. The opening clause of replacement subsection (2) repeats the existing provision with the addition of a specific reference to &ldquo;the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;, determining if disclosure is appropriate. This has always been the practice and reality, but it is now being explicitly stated in law. In these circumstances, I cannot accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 2.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f2&gt;a) substitutes a new paragraph for paragraphs (f2&gt;a) and (f2&gt;b) of section 21(1). At present these two paragraphs permit disclosure of information to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Garda Síochána with a view to the institution of proceedings on the basis of information obtained under section 19 or 20. The paragraphs are now extended by making it clear that publication or disclosure can be made where it is required with a view to the investigation or prosecution of any suspected offence under any of the legislation specified. Furthermore, the specified references are extended to include breaches of the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1998, and the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This latter addition will achieve the same objective as was being provided for in section 53 by adding subparagraph (i) to section 21(3) of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the intention of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 3 to this paragraph, in fact section 23 of the Companies Act, 1990, contains a specific definition of what the term &ldquo;the Companies Acts&rdquo; means. In that section it is defined as meaning the Companies Acts, the Companies Bill of 1963 and every enactment, including this Bill, which is to be construed as one with that Act. Given that the present Bill, by virtue of section 1, will be construed with the earlier Companies Acts, it is not necessary to make the insertion proposed by Deputy Rabbitte in this instance.</P>
    <P>The proposed paragraphs (f2&gt;b) to (f2&gt;g) add a further number of circumstances to section 21(1) <Col N="113" /> of the 1990 Act for which disclosure can be made. By virtue of the addition of the proposed new paragraph (f2&gt;b) to section 21(1), publication or disclosure, which is required for the purposes of assessing the liability of a person in respect of a tax or duty, or other payment owed or payable to the State, a local authority or a health board is now provided for. Paragraph (f2&gt;c) adds the performance by a tribunal to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998, apply. This is equivalent to the new paragraph (f2&gt;m) which was being added to subsection (3) by section 53, as had been originally proposed by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>The next addition is for the purposes of assisting or facilitating the performance by any Minister of the Government of his or her functions. Again, this is essentially replacing paragraph (d), which was being added by section 53, and is self explanatory. While I understand the intention behind Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 5 to paragraph (f2&gt;d), and amendment No. 6, which relates to paragraph (f2&gt;i), the amendments which are being made in the present substitute section 53 are to provisions contained in the Companies Act, 1990; in other words we are textually amending a masculine only Act. The drafting convention in such circumstances is to continue to use the masculine only. The Government decision that legislation be cast in gender neutral language was only taken in 1993.</P>
    <P>The next addition to section 21(1) &ndash; paragraph (f2&gt;e) &ndash; is for the purpose of assisting or facilitating any accountancy or other professional organisation in the performance of its disciplinary functions with respect to any of its members. Again, this replaces paragraph (f2&gt;k), which was being added to section 21(3) by section 53 but is more tightly focused.</P>
    <P>The next addition is the inclusion of the Irish Takeover Panel or any stock exchange established in the State in respect of the performance by such body. Paragraph (f2&gt;j) of subsection (3), which was being added by section 53, had included the stock exchange and we are now including the Irish Takeover Panel in the category of bodies to which disclosure can be made when this is required in relation to carrying on its functions. Paragraph (f2&gt;g) of substituted subsection (1) provides for the essence of paragraphs (f2&gt;n) and (f2&gt;o) which were being added by section 53 to subsection (3) where this is necessary for complying with the requirements of procedural fairness. Paragraphs (f2&gt;h) and (f2&gt;i) repeat paragraphs (c) and (f2&gt;d) of the existing section 21(1). Paragraph (f2&gt;j) repeats the existing reference to section 20 in 21(1)(f2&gt;e) and now provides that publication or disclosure can be made for proceedings under section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990. This deals with proceedings for the disqualification of directors of companies. It is designed essentially to enable the Minister to refer an authorised officer's report to the DPP and for the DPP to refer it onwards to the Garda, with the ultimate view of bringing proceedings under section 160 of <Col N="114" /> the 1990 Act for the disqualification of directors where this is warranted.</P>
    <P>I will deal later with amendments Nos. 1 and 4 tabled by Deputies Rabbitte and Owen to subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the addition of one competent authority to those specified in the existing section 21(3) of the Companies Act, 1990. This is essentially the same amendment as was being provided for in section 53, subparagraph (f2&gt;i) in respect of an authority established outside the State which exercises functions of investigating or prosecuting an offence, or which are otherwise similar to those referred to in the specified paragraphs of the amended section 21(1). Otherwise, the list of competent authorities remains as in the existing section 21(3) of the Companies Act, 1990. In relation to Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 8 to the new subsection (3), the existing reference to &ldquo;any court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; in section 21(3) of the 1990 Act remains as I have just indicated, namely, unaltered by virtue of my current amendment. Consequently, the need for the first part of the Deputy's amendment does not arise. As I have also already indicated, the second part of the Deputy's amendment is catered for by the new section 21(1)(f2&gt;c) of my amendment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is essentially self explanatory and is designed to ensure information that is currently in the possession of the Minister, whether gathered before or after the enactment of the amendment, can be made available to any of the parties if this is warranted. It is necessary, however, to point out that each such party or person to whom confidential information is disclosed will themselves be bound by the secrecy provisions. Some comments have been made in respect of this provision and I will deal with them later.</P>
    <P>Turning to amendments Nos. 4 and 7 tabled by Deputies Owen and Rabbitte, I can confirm that the question of the designation of either House of the Oireachtas, or a committee appointed by either or both Houses, or a number of variations thereof, as a competent authority has been the subject of very detailed consideration by us at all levels. My decision in this instance not to propose or accept such an amendment was very much influenced by the manner in which use has been made of the existing provisions and the ongoing investigations under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990. A number of factors lead me to the conclusion that it would not be appropriate to include either House of the Oireachtas or a committee of the House. At present sections 19 and 20 provide a statutory basis for intervention by the Minister to uncover on a confidential basis information relating to a company which can subsequently be used in company law, criminal or other investigations. They are purely information gathering mechanisms which enable the Minister to make a more informed judgment on what action is appropriate in a particular case. There may be many persons named in such company <Col N="115" /> information, but unless the persons are past or present officers or employees of the company or have been in possession of the company's books and documents, an authorised officer, appointed by the Minister under section 19, has no legal right to question such persons. Some of these persons may have a perfectly reasonable explanation for their association with the company, notwithstanding perceived illegality on the part of the company or its officers. Because of his or her limited powers, an authorised officer may be unaware of those explanations in presenting the information available to him or her to the Minister. The statutory prohibition on publication of this information enables this preliminary investigation process to remain intact, because it shields potentially innocent parties from possible public opprobrium.</P>
    <P>There is not even a legal requirement on an authorised officer under section 19 to advise the company or any of its officers of the content of the information available before he or she concludes his or her examination. Such a requirement may, however, arise after the Minister receives the information in question. If, for instance, the Minister decides to proceed with the appointment of inspectors, the High Court will order that the relevant documentation be transmitted to the company and other appropriate parties to allow them to oppose the ministerial application. Similarly, if inspectors are appointed and undertake a wide-ranging series of interviews of persons named in the authorised officer's report, the persons involved will have a full opportunity at that stage to make known their association with the company's activities. It is possible to have such a restricted role discharged by an authorised officer without compromising procedural fairness, because the information is not publishable and because the report, conclusions and opinions of an authorised officer have no legal status.</P>
    <P>Having assessed the information made available, it is the Minister who decides the next steps. It is that decision that is recognised in law. If an authorised officer's report was capable of being published, it would irrevocably alter the entire structure of a section 19 examination. To avoid injustice being done to the character and reputation of potentially innocent parties, who may be indirectly associated with a company in which potential wrongdoing may have taken place, section 19 exercises would have to be transformed into full-blown inspector-type investigations. An authorised officer would have to be given the power to address parties not directly associated with the company before finalising his or her report. This would prolong the preliminary investigation stage which is intended principally to establish in the first instance if an inspector's inquiry into the company's affairs is warranted. If that were the consequence, the advantages of the section 19 preliminary investigation, which is conducted on a very cost-effective basis at present, <Col N="116" /> would have disappeared, and I am not prepared to remove a valuable instrument of initial inquiry from our armoury of investigating suspected corporate malpractice. If this instrument were not available we might never gather sufficient information to warrant a more thorough inquiry, whether that be the appointment of inspectors by the court to conduct a general inquiry of the company's affairs, or an investigation mounted by other relevant authorities. In any event, I do not consider it appropriate that the Minister or his or her authorised officer should have unfettered powers to summon persons to attend for interview. The appointment of an authorised officer is made for reasons of administrative convenience, because the Minister cannot be personally expected to undertake such examinations of company books and documents.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate in my view that the Minister or an authorised officer acting on his or her behalf should have a general power to question a company's suppliers or customers on their commercial relationship with the company. It is also the case, of course, that information obtained pursuant to section 19 or 20 may include commercially sensitive corporate information. Companies being investigated under the Companies Acts have a general expectation that their rights to confidentiality and-or privacy will be properly respected. The balance which is at the heart of the provisions of the 1990 Act is that companies permit access to their books and records to the Minister and authorised officer on the basis that the relevant information will be kept confidential by the Minister and his or her Department, other than in exceptional cases. This give and take between the regulator and the regulated companies would break down if there were a substantial possibility that information on the companies was readily publishable. There would likely be regular challenges involving High Court judicial reviews of ministerial decisions to initiate section 19 examinations and injunctive proceedings, preventing disclosure of section 19 information if the risk of public disclosure under Oireachtas   privilege existed. In short, companies would see that their commercial interests would be capable of being sacrificed on the altar of political expediency and, accordingly, would not be prepared to lend co-operation with the preliminary investigation process envisaged under section 19.</P>
    <P>In this context, the House should know that sections 19 to 21 and related provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, are being challenged before the Supreme Court at this time on the grounds that, <i>inter alia</i>, they are contrary to the Constitution in that they fail to have any or any due regard to a company's right to confidentiality and-or privacy; that they fail to protect and vindicate a company's right to fair procedures, natural and constitutional justice and equality before the law, and that they constitute an unwarranted and unjustified interference with the property rights of a company. Acceptance of any amendment which would enable publication to take place <Col N="117" /> would also substantially weaken our Supreme Court defence.</P>
    <P>Based on experience to date, many company investigations suggest that breaches of law may have taken place. It is entirely reasonable that the Minister should be able to notify other authorities of such wrongdoing so that they can perform their own respective roles in supervising the activity of persons disclosed in the report of an authorised officer and take corrective action. The amendments which I have made to section 21(1) and which I have just explained in detail will facilitate this process. It was never envisaged that this preliminary information would be disclosable to this House or a committee thereof. In this regard, a distinction can be drawn in respect of disclosure to other competent authorities which would only happen where such authorities could be expected to take action.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested publicly that the Government, in resisting publication of the Ansbacher report, is acting inconsistently with the substance of this amendment. It has at all material times been the intention of the Government in proposing an amendment to section 21 of the Bill on Report Stage to give the terms of the amendment retrospective effect in so far as the purposes mentioned in section 21(1) or the list of competent authorities stated in section 21(3) were concerned. To do so does not raise any constitutional problem.</P>
    <P>At no time has the Government argued that the prohibition in the Constitution in Article 15.5, which states that &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;, prevents the Oireachtas from changing with retrospective effect the purposes for which material gathered under the confidentiality obligations set out in section 21 may subsequently be used. The Government's position is different. The Government has taken the view that it is not open to the Government to publish, in the sense of throwing information into the public domain, any report furnished by an authorised officer who has invoked the powers set out in section 19, if the effect of doing so was to name and shame individual citizens to whom an opportunity had not been given effectively to defend their reputations and good names.</P>
    <P>Any report, therefore, which summarised information gleaned under section 19 and which contained seriously adverse conclusions drawn by an authorised officer for the purpose of advising a Minister on the issue of applying to the High Court to appoint inspectors, could not be absolved retrospectively from the obligation to vindicate the constitutional rights of citizens by some legislative wave of the wand. Furthermore, section 19 powers would be seriously compromised if an Oireachtas committee were free by law to make public the contents of any report based on their exercise. This is specifically envisaged in the amendment put down by Deputy Owen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> If, for example, Oireachtas committees were given the power to publish files on current Garda investigations in the pursuit of some name and shame strategy in respect of crimes of major public interest, it would completely undermine the capacity of the Garda Síochána to investigate such crimes or to record the results of their investigations for the purpose of prosecution. If suspects in criminal investigations knew that any Garda file concerning them was liable to be made public to an Oireachtas committee, those who conducted the investigation would be bound to act wholly differently and almost in a quasi-judicial fashion when compiling their reports.</P>
    <P>Even as things stand, inspectors who are obliged to afford due process to persons and bodies under investigation are still not free to publish their reports without the permission of the High Court. The High Court, in turn, is obliged, in considering whether it should make public the conclusions of inspectors appointed under the Act, to take into account the constitutional rights of persons which might be affected by publication and to balance the common good with individual rights.</P>
    <P>The notion of allowing an Oireachtas committee to conduct a parallel investigation to that being carried out by High Court inspectors is misconceived. The inquiring role of an Oireachtas committee is no different from that of the inspectors. The Minister cannot simply sacrifice investigatory powers under the Companies Act to some name and shame agenda of individual Members of the Oireachtas who have absolute privilege in respect of the utterances they make in either House of the Oireachtas or committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In short, the Government's objection to pursuing a name and shame strategy advocated by some Opposition Members entailing the use of a committee of the Oireachtas lies not in the prohibition mentioned in Article 15 of the Constitution but with two other considerations: first, the legal impossibility in the case of Ansbacher of pretending that the report furnished to the Tánaiste by her authorised officer could simply be thrown into the public domain while at the same time protecting long established constitutional rights of fair procedure and due process for individuals named in the report and, second, the serious damage that would be implied for powers of investigation under the Companies Act if every investigatory report had to be compiled on the basis that it would be made public under the absolute privilege accorded by the Constitution to the proceedings of Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the Supreme Court, in the Haughey decision, was concerned to ensure that the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts would not be abused to damage an individual under investigation without affording him or her fair procedures. Fair procedures in the Ansbacher context could not be achieved retrospectively by changing the law to make public a <Col N="119" /> report which many might read as a damning indictment of some persons named in it and obliging those people to pick up the pieces by making their defence for the first time in public to charges and conclusions which were never put to them in private. None of the competent authorities envisaged by the Government amendment can engage in name and shame tactics. All of them will receive the information on the basis that it will only be used for the discharge of their official functions and then only in a way which, one way or the other, allows fair procedures to persons mentioned in any report.</P>
    <P>I favour publication of the results of completed investigations in due course, following proper conformity with constitutional procedures and due process. For these reasons, I have no intention of relaxing the present strict limitations against publication and effectively reversing the law in order to permit publication of sections 19 and 20 material. In light of the foregoing, I am unable to accede to the amendments proposed by Deputies Rabbitte and Owen or any variation thereto.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, tabled by Deputy Rabbitte, I do not accept that section 21 should be amended to permit the Information Commissioner to determine whether confidential company information should be publicly disclosed. I am aware from recent press reports that the commissioner has recommended that section 21 should be included in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. The effect of such a change could enable confidential corporate information to be published by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>As I previously indicated, our experience with the operation of section 19 examinations of company books and documents, which are protected by the secrecy provisions of section 21, is that a wide prohibition on disclosure is necessary. These examinations are intrusive to the company concerned and its officers must be assured that the information gathered will have a high degree of protection from disclosure. If that assurance cannot be offered by the Minister and his or her Department, the company concerned may well decide to resist the conduct of the examination either through the courts or otherwise. Such an outcome would defeat the process of preliminary investigation which is envisaged in section 19. Such an outcome would also be counterproductive to the public interest of seeking to uncover corporate malpractice and of applying the rigours of the law to those found to be in breach in due course.</P>
    <P>It is already our experience that the strict prohibition on disclosure in section 21 is not enough. Two companies have already gone to great lengths to question the bona fides of the Minister and his or her Department in their compliance with their statutory duty under this section. If a public interest test were to determine whether information were to be disclosed, every company <Col N="120" /> which is the subject of examination would believe that publication of its corporate affairs would be the inevitable outcome of being subject to a section 19 examination.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their patience while I explained the various changes in amendment No. 33 and my reasons for not accepting the eight amendments proposed to it by Deputies Owen and Rabbitte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In the first line of subsection (2), after &ldquo;1990,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall be added to the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Where does one start? What we have heard from the Minister of State amounts to a Second Stage speech. I appreciate the trouble to which he went and the conscientious manner with which his advisers addressed what is a subject of great public interest. It is a pity we are asked to respond to this off the top of our heads on Report Stage of a Bill because it is easy to play politics with the subject, given the environment in which we are debating it. I accept it would be irresponsible not to give weighty consideration to some of the arguments advanced in the Minister of State's densely worded statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is on least firm ground in respect of my amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 33, which relates to permitting the Information Commissioner to adjudicate on this. I have not seen the report and I gather from what the Minister of State said he has not seen it either. <Col N="121" /> He referred to press reports. I have a report from <i>The Irish Times </i>on this aspect, which states:</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, has recommended that the law under which the names of Ansbacher account holders are being withheld by the Government should be changed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy argued in June that issues of privacy or prejudice to an investigation should be adjudicated on by him under the Freedom of Information Act, rather than dealt with under the Companies Act. Concern that the change would give rise to a large number of judicial reviews was not a proper reason for maintaining secrecy, he said.</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner has given a good deal of thought to this issue. The effect of my amendment would be to insert in section 53(2) the phrase, &ldquo;Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, shall be added to the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1999.and is hereby amended.&rdquo;, etc. The import of that simply means that the Freedom of Information Act would override the existing position.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, in his cogently argued and detailed speech that runs to 34 pages &ndash; which is very unusual in a Report Stage debate &ndash; dismissed the arguments of the Information Commissioner and my amendment on the basis that the effect of such a change could enable confidential, corporate information to be published by the commissioner. That seems to be a value judgment, which suggests the Information Commissioner could be less responsible than the Minister and her agents. I do not know what the Minister can adduce in favour of that proposition. It seems most unlikely that the Information Commissioner would conduct himself or herself in such a fashion as to wantonly put into the public domain sensitive, commercial information that would be likely to damage a company. I do not consider that is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>The request would be made under the Freedom of Information Act and the Minister would decide whether he or she wanted to accede to that request, given the particular circumstances of the case. If the Minister decided it should be released, it would be released and that would be the Minister's decision. If the Minister decided to resist, I argue &ndash; as provided for in my amendment &ndash; that the Information Commissioner should evaluate the merits of the case. Whatever argument the Minister of State may have against that proposition, I respectfully suggest the one he advanced is wrong &ndash; that the Information Commissioner would be likely to act in an irresponsible fashion by releasing into the public domain sensitive, corporate data. I do not believe that would happen. I am dealing with this matter because it is the subject of the first of the subsidiary amendments. If the Minister of State dealt with the matter, I failed to pick it up.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of amendment No. 33 reads:</P>
    <P>The amendments effected by this section <Col N="122" /> shall apply in relation to the publication or disclosure, after its commencement, of information, books or documents which have been obtained under section 19 or 20 of the Companies Act, 1990, whether before or after that commencement.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State can protest if I am reading that subsection incorrectly, but it seems to suggest that once this section is enacted, such disclosure or publication may take place before or after the commencement of the section. In other words, it may take place retrospectively, in that events that happened prior to the enactment may be published or disclosed under this section.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State inhabits the same House as I, but I thought it was the subject of feverish debate inside and outside this House for more than a week when the Government from the Taoiseach down &ndash; I remember specifically a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; performance by the Government Chief Whip and one by the Taoiseach in the House &ndash; resisted any notion of retrospective capacity in this regard. It was stoutly argued by the Government that one simply could not do this, but the Minster of State, Deputy Treacy, said: &ldquo;I wish to make it clear that it has, at all material times, been the intention of the Government in proposing an amendment to section 21 of the Bill on Report Stage to give the terms of the amendment retrospective effect .&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There was no doubt about the way the Government responded. It said this retrospection was not possible or constitutionally feasible.

      <P>I am not ungrateful for the fact that the matter has been treated seriously. However, this is a political U-turn. To tell us now that it did not raise any constitutional problem and that it was always the Government's intention to give retrospective effect boggles the mind. It beggars belief that this can be reconciled with the position the Government has argued up to now.</P>
      <P>I do not recall anyone in this House arguing that this information should be put into the public domain in a manner contrary to law. As I understand it, arguments were made on this side of the House that the law should be changed, with retrospective effect, to facilitate this information becoming public in an orderly fashion. If, for example, that meant the persons involved being advised of the intention to so do, that would be complied with. That was the intention and it was to that argument that the Government replied the law could not be changed retrospectively. We now find out the law can be changed retrospectively.</P>
      <P>If we did not have the Ansbacher controversy and we were discussing this in the context of the reform of company law, the Minister would have to explain to me, having put on the record his formal statement which was helpful and worthy of detailed consideration, why he decided to do a total about turn. One cannot glide over his amendment&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When we considered this matter on Committee Stage the Minister lengthened the list of competent authorities to whom disclosure might be made. He has now made that list of competent authorities contingent on the Minister's opinion that this information should be conferred on them. The Minister asked me to point out the about turn. Section 53(2) states that no information may be &ldquo;published or disclosed, except to a competent authority, unless the publication or disclosure is, in the opinion of the Minister, required with a view to the investigation or prosecution of any offence, being an offence&rdquo; under the various Acts, such as the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, the Exchange Control Acts, the Companies Acts etc. Provided the Minister is of the opinion, the information may now be <Col N="124" /> referred to these competent authorities, whereas on Committee Stage it was feasible to publish this information to these competent authorities, regardless of what the Minister thought. There was no question of a subjective test at that stage; it was an objective test and the information would automatically go to a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>We had dealt here with the ongoing example of the Moriarty tribunal. A significant amount of money has been allocated to support the sole member of that tribunal in inquiring into certain matters. The Tánaiste is engaged in separate overlapping inquiries and has received a report in that regard. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that she is bound to be possessed of information that is pertinent to the work of the Moriarty tribunal. Up to now, that may not have been made or put at the disposal of Mr. Justice Moriarty. The change the Minister of State made on Committee Stage and which we welcomed on this side of the House would have permitted the transfer of that information to the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will probably say it can still be transferred to the Moriarty tribunal provided the Minister agrees. I do not know if the Tánaiste or the Minister of State is the Minister in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both of us are involved. I was the first person to bring in the authorised officer. When it goes up another line, it goes to the Tánaiste. The Tánaiste is the person responsible at inspector level and I am the person responsible at authorised officer level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the Tánaiste in this case. Given the Tánaiste's public pronouncements on this matter, one presumes the only decision she can make in this regard is that she is of the opinion that the matter should be transferred to Mr. Justice Moriarty. However, there is no guarantee that would be the view if a different Tánaiste or Minister was appointed tomorrow morning or if it was a different issue. The Minister of State should not shrug his shoulders or wave his hands at me because it is a serious material difference. The Minister of the day may take the view, for whatever reason, that it will not be so transferred to such a tribunal of inquiry. This also refers to other competent authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has changed the orientation of the amendment because it is now governed by the requirement to be in line with the opinion of the Minister. As long as the Minister is of that opinion, this range of competent bodies may get this information, otherwise they will not. That is a retrogressive step. I am glad Deputy Owen has moved that we recommit to discuss some of this. We are in an unusual position. If this had been in the original Bill&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that and if it were in the original Bill or in the Bill on Committee Stage we would be discussing paragraphs (f2&gt;h), (f2&gt;c), (f2&gt;d), (f2&gt;e), (f2&gt;f), (f2&gt;g) and so on as individual items within the context of the overall framework. It makes it difficult for us. I am not objecting that this is a statement of coherent philosophy from the Department in terms of the overall issue. I still believe it does not affect some of the specific matters I have raised such as, for example, the Information Commissioner and the fact that the entire orientation of the law will be changed in as much as it requires the assent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I stand firmly by amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 33. I do not know how Deputy Owen is minded of it but it should be pressed to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. As regards the amendments thereafter, amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 33 deals with the point &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; and there is a head-on conflict between the Government and the Opposition on that one. We will deal with that as it arises. I accept the Minister's point on amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 33. I am not making a big issue about amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to amendment No. 33. I will, however, be telling the Tánaiste that the Minister resisted the insertion of the word &ldquo;her&rdquo; and all the rest and he will have to take the consequences of that.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 to amendment No. 33 is an entirely different matter. It is against this amendment that the Department marshals the main thrust of its fire power in arguing that you could not possibly have a committee of the House seized of this information. That is something we will come back to when we deal with the detail of the amendment. Deputy Owen's amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 33 is quite similar. I am prepared to accept what the Minister says about the first part of amendment No. 8 to amendment No. 33. Clearly what he is saying is that the court of competent jurisdiction is already in the original Act. That is not a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech: &ldquo;Before concluding, it is only fair to say, as has been indicated previously, that I favour publication of the results of completed investigations in due course following proper conformity with constitutional procedures and due process.&rdquo;  That is a far more carefully drafted sentence than might appear at the outset. One might read it or hear it on television. Anyone who is reduced to watching company law on television has a very boring life, but <Col N="126" /> RTE already provides for that as by the time it broadcasts &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, at 1.30 a.m., there will not be too many watching company law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not, but in so far as they were watching, they would say the Minister favours publication of the results. That is what strikes you about it. This goes back to the many commitments the Tánaiste has given that she cannot wait to tell us what she knows. People will read or hear that and ask what we are complaining about, did the Minister not say he favours publication? Favouring publication is different from saying he will publish. He is not saying that, he is saying he favours publication in due course following proper conformity with constitutional procedures and due process. Given people's expectation in respect of the controversial Ansbacher issue, there may be many impediments that could be raised within the rubric of that sentence. I do not accept that this means the Minister will publish. It is a statement of intent at this time and no more than that.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for facilitating that initial response. I want to come back to my amendment No. 7 to amendment No. 33 which, together with that of Deputy Owen, is being attacked by the substantial arguments advanced by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to know where to begin. If I had more time I could argue something on every page. The general broad point the Minister seems to be making in his statement is that he has changed the orientation of the amendment he tabled on Committee Stage and has turned it around. On Committee Stage the Minister tabled, very belatedly, a simple, straightforward amendment to section 21(3). It did nothing more than extend the list of competent authorities that were in the original Act, paragraphs (f2&gt;a), (f2&gt;b), (f2&gt;c), (f2&gt;d), (f2&gt;e), (f2&gt;f), (f2&gt;g) and (f2&gt;h). The Minister added in a new paragraph (f2&gt;d), (f2&gt;e), (f2&gt;f), (f2&gt;g), (f2&gt;h), (f2&gt;i), (f2&gt;j), (f2&gt;k), (f2&gt;l), (f2&gt;m), (f2&gt;n) and (f2&gt;o) and said, simply and cleanly, &ldquo;the purpose of this amendment is essentially to widen the definition of competent authorities for the purposes of section 21(3)&rdquo;. There was no mention of any other section or subsection, yet in this amendment the Minister has gone much further. Not only has he not extended the list of competent authorities there is one general bringing together, as he indicated in section 53(3)(f2&gt;b) where it states:</P>
      <P>by the substitution for paragraph (f2&gt;h) of the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(f2&gt;h) the Central Bank, and</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;i) any authority established outside the State . functions which are similar to the .functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> In his first amendment on Committee Stage he did not propose a provision similar to that contained in section 53(4). He did not bring in an amendment that had the same import as section 53(4), which is the section that is making this new amendment retrospective. There was no mention of it on Committee Stage and no effort was made to change the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What page is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 7. On the Companies Act, 1990, the Minister said in his speech that the opening clause of replacement section (21)(1) repeats the existing provision, with the addition of a specific reference to &ldquo;the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; determining if disclosure is appropriate. This has always been the practice and reality but it is now being explicitly stated in the law.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister my interpretation of this. He says this has always been the practice and reality and he will now explicitly state it in the law. I do not believe that to be the case. Section 21(1) of the Companies Act, 1990, does not refer to &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. It clearly states that no information, book or document relating to a body which has been obtained under section 19 or 20 shall, without the consent of that body, be published or disclosed, except to a competent authority. It does not require the Minister to decide because she does not have to give an opinion, only as to whether the publication or disclosure is required at section 21(1) &ndash; (f2&gt;a), (f2&gt;b), (f2&gt;c), (f2&gt;d) or (f2&gt;e). The reason those who drafted this section omitted &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; is the Minister is included in the list of competent authorities.</P>
      <P>When this section was drafted, if the Minister was to receive this report and had the right, in his or her opinion, to decide who else was to receive it, it would not have been necessary to list the Minister as a competent authority to receive the report. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was listed as a competent authority. That may be a complex argument but it begs the question, why in 1990 did the Department, the draftsman and the Attorney General decide to include the Minister as a competent authority if, as the Minister says, the Minister could always decide what to do with the information? Why did he or she have to be listed as one of the competent authorities if it was automatically assumed he or she was the main competent authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By adding the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;, the Minister has changed the basis of this section. In the Minister's amendment on Committee Stage, there was no question &ndash; a Minister relevant to the subject matter of the report or the information was listed as a competent authority and he or she could get that information once it was relevant to them. It referred to the Minister for Finance or any other Minister of the Government in whom functions stand vested, the performance of which could be assisted or facilitated by the publication. The <Col N="128" /> Minister can now decide he or she will withhold information from another Minister. The Minister may decide he or she does not like someone or someone is not entitled to have information about their Department in case it is detrimental and some action could be taken to take corrective action before the hammer falls. The Minister has the power to decide whether a person is a competent authority. The draftsman and the Minister are missing the point of this section. It is supposed to list the people who receive these reports and I do not believe that is the case.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Rabbitte already mentioned, the Minister said &ldquo;I wish to make it clear that it has, at all material times, been the intention of the Government in proposing an amendment to section 21 of the Bill on Report Stage to give the terms of the amendment retrospective effect in so far as the purposes...&rdquo;. On Committee Stage, the Minister did not explicitly state his intention that this legislation would retrospectively apply to reports already in the process of being carried out. When some of the Ansbacher names &ndash; particular names from a particular section of society &ndash; were selectively leaked we were told the ground rules could not be changed after the process had begun. I still do not know who leaked them or for what purpose, one can only make a personal assessment. The implication was that if Mr. Ryan investigated a person and asked questions, that person answered them on the basis of section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990 and all that was implied in that section. So, in giving answers and saying &ldquo;yes, I did this&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes, I did not pay tax&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes, I gave people money&rdquo;, they were doing it on the basis that they knew that report might end up with a competent authority; the Minister, a person authorised by the Minister, an inspector appointed under the Act, the Minister for Finance, an officer authorised by the Minister for Finance, any court of competent jurisdiction, a supervisory authority and the Central Bank. In answering those questions six months ago or yesterday, those people were doing so on the basis of the 1990 Act. The Minister said he could not expect the set of rules to be changed when people gave answers to questions based on another set of rules and they would have had to be told beforehand.</P>
    <P>It was my interpretation of what the Minister said in this House on Committee Stage that amendment No. 38 and the new section inserted in the 1990 Act would be relevant to inquiries carried out after the Act came into force. That is the only way the Government can sustain the argument it made a few weeks ago that it could not introduce retrospective legislation and change the ground rules for people who had co-operated with an inspector in an investigation. The Minister did not give any indication on Committee Stage that this legislation would apply to reports that had not been lodged with the Minister but were still being prepared. The only mention by the Minister in this regard on Committee Stage was, &ldquo;We have added in &lsquo;all of these', thereby <Col N="129" /> removing all impediments for the future.&rdquo;  That is the only terminology which made me believe this would become law and would only refer to new reports prepared under section 19 relating to inspectors' reports. The Minister did not at any stage say otherwise. I think I have proved that was the Minister's intention because subsection (4) contained in this amendment refers to &ldquo;books or documents which have been obtained under section 19 or 20 of the Companies Act, 1990, whether before or after that commencement&rdquo;. I would like the Minister to admit that at the very least, his Committee Stage amendment was flawed because it did not contain that section. He seemed to imply that was his intention.</P>
    <P>I take exception to the tone of some of the Minister's contribution. For example, &ldquo;The Government has taken the view that it is not open to the Government to publish, in the sense of throwing information into the public domain...&rdquo;. Perhaps that is supposed to be a reference to serious parliamentary requests from this side of the House to ensure the leaking of names did not lead to people using it as a defence against prosecution. We wanted a legal process whereby names could be put in the public domain. If only some of the names came out, those people could never be prosecuted because they would have the protection of being able to challenge any evidence that had already been leaked. I object to comments like &ldquo;throwing information&rdquo;. I also object to the tone in which the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Minister [meaning Deputy Harney, because I assume the Minister of State has not taken on the mantle of talking about himself in the third person] cannot simply sacrifice investigatory powers under the Companies Act to some name and shame agenda of individual Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That is not the import of my amendment. Its import is to add to the group of people or the purposes for which the Minister, in the opinion of the Minister, might decide to pass on information. She does not have to, no more than she has to pass it on to the tribunal or for the purpose of assisting or facilitating the performance of any Minister of the Government or any other functions. She can ignore that whole menu if she wants to, but equally she could pick anyone or everybody out of that menu and say they are all entitled to have this information for the purposes of their own good use. I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept &ndash; particularly when one has the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; there as a safeguard &ndash; that a committee of the Oireachtas would not be a competent body to be added to this list. Then it would be a judgment for the Minister to decide. I cannot immediately provide an example of a time when I think the Minister might decide it is appropriate to send it to a committee of the House, but there may come a time. Who would have thought five years ago that Deputy Jim Mitchell's Committee of Public <Col N="130" /> Accounts would be doing the job it is doing and in such a way?</P>
    <P> Having not inserted any amendment into the legislation when first published, having introduced a late amendment on Committee Stage to add to the competent authority list, and having now turned himself completely on his head by removing that amendment and inserting a new one, what will we have in a week's time? Will the Minister of State suddenly decide he has made a mistake by leaving something else out? Now is the time to copperfasten in this list any possible advantage there may be to having a different form of extra competent body to whom the Minister may want to send a report.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my party ever stated that we wanted names thrown into the public domain in a name and shame game or agenda. We wanted to make sure that there was fairness and equity about what was happening. A very small number of people have been given Mr. Ryan's report, yet from that small group some names managed to be leaked. Nobody knows who it was but only 15 copies of the report were distributed. It is fair to say that the Minister and her officials had the report for a full six weeks before it was handed on to anybody else, and there was never any question of anything coming out from that report. That happened after the list began to be widened. I want to say that to the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, lest they think I might be saying they leaked it.</P>
    <P>The Government has turned its own arguments on their head. It persisted in saying it could not change the ground rules on the basis of which Mr. Ryan's report was gathered. If the Minister wanted to, she could change the law to make the report available publicly. The argument she and the Minister of State used was that one cannot change the playing pitch after the game has started. The Minister is doing that now, however, for the remaining 13 reports in the Department. Perhaps it is more than that now, but according to the reply to the last parliamentary question I tabled, 13 investigations were continuing. Some of them have been completed while others are half way through. There are still probably five or six in train. When this Bill becomes law, even people concerned with those reports already in the process will be subject to the legislation. That is retrospection no matter what way one looks at it. I want to hear what the Minister of State has to say about the points that I and Deputy Rabbitte have raised. As Deputy Rabbitte said, the Minister of State has maintained his gracious firepower to knock amendments Nos. 4 and 7. He rubbished them as if it was &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; and we wanted to break all the laws in the land and did not care what the inspectors had done, nor what the High Court or anyone else would do. That is grossly unfair because nobody on this side of the House demanded any exposure of names without the law being changed. That is where we came up against a brick wall. We were told one could not change the law retrospectively. <Col N="131" /> The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, said so to the 750,000 people who listen to &ldquo;Morning Ireland.&rdquo; Other Ministers continued to sell that line, but where is it now? Based on that argument the Minister of State is as naked as the day he was born.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has been left exposed by all those arguments that were made over recent weeks and by subsection (4). I would like to hear how that subsection has appeared here and was not in the Minister of State's amendment on Committee Stage. I would like to hear the Minister of State's assessment of my interpretation of why the original writers of the 1990 Act did not insert the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. I am sure some of the Minister of State's officials were around at that time. Is it not because they added the Minister in as a competent authority? For once they actually treated the Minister in the Department in the same way as all the other competent authorities were being treated. That Minister was not given a higher level of allowability to get this report than any other competent authority that was listed. I would like to hear about that and I reserve the right to come back to the matter again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the progress in the debate and I have listened with interest to the complex discussion on the Bill. I welcome the 34-page circular we have just received on the various amendments, including those of the Minister of State. I appreciate the lengthy explanation and clarification on this section. In light of the points raised by the two previous speakers I now await the Minister's response and clarification on those issues. I support the Minister of State's clarification that there is no intention of relaxing the present strict limitations on publication. Equally, I support the Minister of State's request that we should simply adhere to procedural fairness in all applications, that we should allow due process and acknowledge the right of individuals. I do not see any difficulties with that. The Minister of State has outlined the most appropriate and fairest way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate some of the substantial arguments that have been made by the two previous Opposition speakers, and in particular I listened with interest to the points concerning retrospection. On page 28 of the document that has been circu<Col N="132" /> lated dealing with retrospective issues, in relation to the new section 53(4) it is clearly stated that:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas shall not declare Acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
    <P>That relates to Article 15.5 of the Constitution. I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say in this regard. There may be some crossed lines in relation to the issue of retrospection and I look forward to the Minister of State's clarification in that regard. The House will welcome what the Minister of State is endeavouring to do. I lend my support to what I have picked up from his explanation.</P>
    <P>This has been a lengthy debate but I wish to mention a separate issue. I appreciate the reference to the Association of Company Registration Agents. I, and I am sure others, received a lengthy submission from the Association of Company Registration Agents on the Bill and I acknowledge that the association has a tremendous fund of knowledge on many relevant issues associated with legislation in this area. I recently met a delegation of the association which acknowledged the need to improve and enhance legislation. It has practical concerns over certain aspects and would welcome an opportunity to have a line of communication with the Department, especially on this Bill and all issues relating to the industry. It would be mutually beneficial for those in the association and the Department. I ask the Minister to put down a marker in that respect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to <Col N="133" /> retrospection and I refer Members to what I said. With regard to Ansbacher, the argument on retrospection related to the publication of information which had been gathered under conditions of secrecy. We were legally advised that we could not publish such information. That is the position. The Deputy argued that the amendment is retrospective. However, his argument is misplaced. I have listened to such arguments for the past month but it is totally misplaced for whatever reason. This relates to current information in the possession of the Minister. It is not retrospective. Under the Constitution, the Oireachtas cannot introduce law which is retrospective. This relates to information currently held by the Minister whether gathered before the enactment of the amendment. These investigations are current.</P>

With regard to Ansbacher, the argument on retrospection related to the publication of information which had been gathered under conditions of secrecy. We were legally advised that we could not publish that information. The Deputy is arguing that the amendment is retrospective, but the argument is misplaced because it relates to current information in the possession of the Minister whether gathered before or after the enactment of the amendment.

      <P>Retrospection with regard to legislation is where something is made an offence. The Deputy is saying that because a report was submitted yesterday and a law is passed today, we are enacting retrospective legislation. However, <Col N="136" /> that is not the case. We are not making anything an offence, which is what retrospection in law means. That is the legal advice available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine. It does not alter the conditions of secrecy under which the information was gathered. Each of the persons to whom confidential information is disclosed is bound by the conditions of secrecy. We have been legally advised that the amendment is in order and does not amount to retrospective legislation. Although Members may wish to use the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo;, it is not retrospective legislation. Article 15.5 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
      <P>We are prevented from doing so. The amendment to section 21 will not make any act a criminal offence; it will enable information to be given to the parties defined in the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment no more than confirms what is done in practice. The Minister's opinion is operative in that he or she must form an opinion and make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to enshrine in law that which is done in practice. The Minister makes the decision to disclose information to the competent authorities. That is the practice and we are enshrining it in law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>In this instance she is the competent authority to make a decision. It is true this will allow Ansbacher information to go to the Moriarty tribunal and I am sure the House agrees with that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte suggested that judicial reviews were not a good reason for not allowing the Information Commissioner adjudicate on section 19 or 20 information on public interest grounds. Our objective is not to denigrate the Information Commissioner or the exercise of his powers. Our concern relates in part to judicial review proceedings. Acceptance of the relevant amendment to the amendment in the name of Deputy Rabbitte would render sections 19 and 20 unworkable. The public interest demands that such preliminary investigation work be allowed to uncover corporate malpractice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to the relationship between the competent authority and the Minister. Under section 21 of the 1990 Act, the Oireachtas decided that the Minister was a competent authority. The Minister did not take that responsibility on to him or herself; the Oireachtas decided. Otherwise, the Minister could not be a <Col N="137" /> competent authority. That is the position since 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen asked why a retrospection amendment was not introduced on Committee Stage. We wanted to ensure that information currently before the Minister could be disclosed to the new competent authorities, for example, the Moriarty tribunal. We do not want somebody to contest the validity of the Minister passing information on the Ansbacher accounts or other information to the Moriarty tribunal or any other competent authority. We decided to remove this ambiguity from the section, which is why this new subsection (4) is proposed under amendment No. 33. It has been fully cleared by all of the Government's legal advisers. I am sure the House will agree it is a laudable objective.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen suggested that movement is now dependent on the opinion of the Minister. This has always been the position and we are including it in statute now. Otherwise, I do not know how else a decision could be exercised. Ministers are appointed to make decisions. If they do not make decisions I do not see the need for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen suggested that the rules on disclosure are being changed. The strict prohibition on publication is not changed. What has changed is that new authorities may be given information on a confidential basis. These authorities, for example, the Moriarty tribunal, must themselves act in accordance, and can only act in accordance, with constitutional procedures. Relevant information can be pointedly disclosed by the tribunal to persons mentioned in such information to obtain the other person's side of the story. It is following that process that the tribunal may disclose information publicly and the person involved will have the right of reply to the tribunal in public. Thus, the requirement of procedural fairness will be fully safeguarded in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have no agenda here other than to say that as a result of what was accepted on Second and Committee Stages and the questions raised on the Order of Business, we have done what we can to respond to the demands made. Within the constitutional parameters and based on the legal advice available to us, we have proposed this final amendment to take into account and encompass the many requests made for disclosure and for action to ensure that the laws can be operated and that malpractice can be eliminated from proper performance on this island.</P>

      <P>Returning to the retrospective <Col N="138" /> element, if, in amending section 21(3) by adding to the list of competent authorities, the Minister of State is not breaching the Constitution&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is retrospective, but the Minister of State says it is possible to proceed on that basis because it does not create an offence. What offence is being created by the amendment of section 21(1)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy read out the subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) deals with secrecy and provides that nothing shall be disclosed. The Minister of State argues that an Oireachtas committee cannot be included on the list, the Minister's wish list. It is not automatic that those listed in the amendment will receive the information. They will do so only if, in the opinion of the Minister of the day, they should. That opinion could be good or questionable. The amendment puts the matter in the hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister of State's contention that the Minister decides on all these aspects. The present legislation did not need the opinion of the Minister to trigger the passing of information to the competent authority. It provided that information should not be published or disclosed except to a competent authority. This more or less obliged the Minister to provide the information to a competent authority if it was assessed that it was necessary for the purposes of instituting criminal proceedings arising out of exchange control and the other matters set out in section 21(1) of the 1990 Act.</P>
      <P>While I accept the Minister was required to assert the view that the various paragraphs of section 21(1) of the 1990 Act were valid in terms of applicability, thereby requiring the passing on of information, it did not require her opinion that this was the case. However, the amendment now provides that her opinion is required. This means she can say that in her opinion the information should not be given to anybody. For example, she may decide not to give it to the Taoiseach, as she did on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State now accept that the Government got advice it can change section 21(3) of the 1990 Act retrospectively? This is being proposed under the amendment when it provides that anything submitted to the Minister, albeit collected under the 1990 Act, can be disclosed to all these new competent bodies if she so decides. That is retrospective.</P>

      <P>It is retrospective. Mr. Ryan undertook an inquiry under sections 19 and 20 of the 1990 Act, which are governed by section 21, and he told certain people he was competently undertaking an investigation accordingly. It was assumed that those involved, or their lawyers, answered his questions in that knowledge. This amendment effectively tells these people that despite the fact that they answered Mr. Ryan's questions under a set of rules, the rules are changed and the information they provided will now be given to a tribunal of investigation. They had every reason to believe this would not be done when they answered the questions. It is, therefore, retrospective in that sense. It is not an offence to give the report to the tribunal, nonetheless it is retrospective because the conditions under which they answered the questions, truthfully or untruthfully as the case may be, were different from what the report will be based on.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is no constitutional imperative on the Government to amend section 21(1) to allow publication after the report has been drawn up? It is not an offence to allow publication of the report by presenting it to a committee of the House or to anyone else. Just because information is gathered on the basis that it was collected under secrecy and would not be made available is exactly the same argument that information was collected on the basis that the competent authorities were just A, B, C, D and E and that they will now be much wider. There is no intellectual way in which to argue that amending the rule about secrecy is in itself doing what Article 15.5 precludes, that is, &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo;  Amending the secrecy clause under which the information was collected is not creating an infringement or putting a crime on to somebody. Perhaps one might argue that some of the information they gave might not have been given if they knew the report would be available to a wider circle of people. However, the act of collecting it under a secrecy clause and changing it after it had been collected is not saying they committed a crime or that the Government committed a crime. That is what the Opposition was attempting to do when we proposed an amendment to the 1990 Act. The Minister of State said that the Government could not accept this, yet section 21(3) can be amended. The argument is very faulty and weak and I do not understand how the Minister of State can continue to argue that it could not be referred to a Dáil committee because the information would become public. The inference is that because the information was collected under secrecy if it went to a Dáil committee somebody might hear about it. There is a weakness in the Minister of State's argument in being able to amend section 21(3) and not being able to amend section 21(1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that it has always been the intention of the Government in proposing an amendment to section 21 to give the terms of the <Col N="140" /> amendment retrospective effect. This is not what the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, said on radio the morning he defended the Government's denial of any amendment to the law. He said it was not the Government's intention to make any retrospective change to this law. It certainly was not its intention on 21 July. At no stage did the Minister of State say on Committee Stage that the new section extending the competent authority lists would be retrospective. He said that all the new extras were being added, thereby removing all impediments for the future, not for the present but for the future. It does not take a great deal of brain power for one to interpret this to mean that when this becomes law it will be the law for the future. I do not know how the Minister of State can argue that it was always the Government's intention to make retrospective changes to the Act. I will not accept that.</P>

      <P>I thought when we received the text that we would seek to address the serious arguments advanced. I cannot see the point of the Minister of State persisting with this manifestly ludicrous argument that this does not have retrospective effect. The matter is simple. If we take the Ryan report as the example, at the stage the information was collated the law applying was different to the law that will apply after this legislation is enacted. It is quite obvious that the law is being changed.</P>

We are saying that the report he has already collated under different rules, at a different time, and under a different law, may now be transferred to whatever competent authority is designated under the new legislation. I do not see the point in persisting with this argument. As I understand it &ndash; the Minister of State can reflect on this and come back to us if we have got it wrong &ndash; once we enact this legislation, and if the Minister is of the opinion that it should be done, Mr. Ryan's report may, for example, now be transferred to Mr. Moriarty.</P>

      <P>My attitude to this is that that is progress. We welcome this. If a great deal of money has been spent on setting up a tribunal of inquiry and if the Tánaiste's diligent officer has assembled information which is pertinent to the inquiry, it is entirely proper this should be referred to the tribunal for its information. Is it <Col N="141" /> correct to say that this information may then be mediated into the public domain? If Mr. Justice Moriarty decides to adduce some of the information in evidence before the tribunal then that will come into the public domain in that fashion.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said in his speech that he has proffered the restructuring of his amendments in response to the Committee Stage debate and the subsequent debate in this House. It is important to say that no one involved in this debate, either the debate which took place in this House or on Committee Stage, suggested the redraft of the section along the lines advanced by him. In respect of subsection (2) which includes for the first time the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;, the Minister of State says, &ldquo;This has always been the practice and reality&rdquo;. That is totally incorrect. Any competent authority which up to now had the information lawfully could take the decision to publish. Why are we now inserting the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;? This has not been included in legislation except where it is for a purpose. The purpose here is that the Minister will govern to whomsoever of the competent authorities the matter is referred in future. It is the Minister's call. This is important because on Committee Stage it was not the Minister's call. If the tribunal of inquiry was to be added to the list of designated competent authorities, then the report would automatically go to the tribunal of inquiry and it would be a matter for the tribunal as to what to do with it.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development)</P>
    <P>Mr. S. Ryan: I wish to share my time with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Fine Gael Private Members' motion on agriculture. I intend to refer specifically to the horticulture industry.</P>
    <P>Throughout the years, the horticulture industry has been deemed the poor relation of the agriculture sector. This is the due to the structure of the industry, the location of growers throughout the country and the lack of organisation of growers. Furthermore, they were deemed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to be a soft option. They were seen not to have any political clout, unlike the dairy and beef sectors, which had the support of the IFA.</P>
    <P>The horticulture industry has witnessed major changes over the past decade. These have come about through open competition, especially from outside the country, demands of supermarket chains and the legitimate concerns of consumers regarding the safety and quality of products. This aspect is important. While some growers have unfortunately fallen by the wayside, the vast majority have responded positively and successfully to the challenges. Changes in the operation and implementation of quality systems to ensure horticultural produce is produced and handled in line with best practice and procedures were essential and costly. By and large, this cost has been borne by the growers. For example, it could cost between £150,000 and £250,000 to purchase the equipment to meet the standards required by supermarkets such as Tesco before they accept produce from a grower.</P>
    <P>Further changes are inevitable, but the question posed by the growers is how, in our climate and the topsy turvy situation in the horticulture industry, they can afford to pay for these improvements. Further changes are inevitable to meet ongoing hygiene and quality standards, health and safety requirements, safe use of crop protection products and environmental protection. These will require substantial investment.</P>
    <P>The growers have a strong case for looking for grant aid from the Minister to help them take the <Col N="144" /> next step in developing the horticulture industry. The Government should not stand aside as growers meet these new market requirements. It is essential the concept of partnership, a concept which created great benefits in other sectors of the economy, is now applied to horticultural growers. I appeal to the Minister in the context of the national plan to respond positively to the needs of some 40,000 commercial growers throughout the country. As part of a wider package, I strongly recommend that a grants scheme be introduced immediately to facilitate further necessary improvements. Lip service is no longer acceptable to the industry. The growers and their families are entitled to the same service from the Government as others in the agriculture sector. The Minister should ensure the needs of these growers are provided for in the development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely and important debate on agriculture which has become the forgotten sector of the economy in the days of the Celtic tiger. Glowing reports of the spectacular performance of our economy fail to take into account the hard times which affect the largest sector of the economy, the agriculture sector. Declining farm incomes, the continuing flight from the land and rural depopulation are problems affecting the agriculture sector. Innovative agriculture policies are essential if we are to seriously address these related problems and chart a new course for rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed to grasp this challenge. His tenure in the Department has been characterised by a cautious approach to the problems of rural Ireland. The future rural Ireland needs and deserves a more radical approach than the Minister has shown to date. I hope the ideas generated by the debate will encourage him to adopt a more innovative approach to agricultural policy and rural development.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on the handling of the complex Agenda 2000 negotiations. A welcome degree of certainty regarding a key factor in Irish agriculture has been put in place. This certainty provides us with an excellent opportunity to plan and develop new policies which will produce results over the coming decade for farmers and for rural Ireland. However, the actions by the Minister since the conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations do not inspire confidence. The method of allocation of the additional milk quota secured under the terms of Agenda 2000 was a missed opportunity. The majority of this quota should have been allocated to farmers producing 35,000 gallons or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 24,000 of these farmers and they struggle to make ends meet as farm incomes continue to decline. These farmers find it increasingly difficult to attract their sons or daughters to take over the farm. As a result of Agenda 2000, the Minister was presented with a great opportunity to make a difference to these <Col N="145" /> farmers and to the viability of hundreds of family farms throughout the country. The Minister knows family farms are a crucial aspect of rural Ireland. The flight from the land is hitting small family farms increasingly hard. Given the paltry income many families have on which to survive, it is little wonder that the sons and daughters from family farms are reluctant to take over and instead are drifting into the towns and cities to find well paid jobs in industry.</P>
    <P>Against this background, there is an overwhelming argument to divert the moneys and method of payment to those who need it. The bureaucratic manner in which the Department deals with small farmers as regards headage payments is unacceptable. A constituent of mine applied for a headage payment for ten animals. When completing his form, he inserted one number twice. The Department wrote back to him, he sent in the correct number but he was penalised. He had ten animals and made one mistake. He was not making a fraudulent application to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The Minister should have some appeals system for these unfortunate individuals who are only human beings and who are not used to this paperwork but are penalised for mistakes in it. The amount in question, £320, is a great deal of money to a small farmer. I appeal to the Minister to put a system in place.</P>
    <P>I have much more to say on the matter, but unfortunately I do not have the time. I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and to support the Minister's amendment. During the course of 1998 and the early part of 1999, this House and the farming organisations were exercised by the difficulties and dangers which might arise from the Agenda 2000 negotiations. Thankfully, as a result of the diligence, commitment and work of the Minister, the Ministers of State and Department officials, we witnessed a very successful outcome to the talks. That outcome has secured the medium-term future of farming and will facilitate long-term planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in a very comprehensive and positive speech, last night outlined in no uncertain terms the importance of farming and agri-industry to the Irish economy. The Department will provide £2 billion in support to the farming industry in 1999. There are 147,000 full-time and part-time farmers in this country and in 1998 direct payments amounted to £1 billion. I am glad the Minister has clearly stated that a substantial increase in funding for agriculture will be provided in the national development plan. That is to be welcomed, not alone from the point of view <Col N="146" /> of those directly involved in farming but also by those living in rural Ireland who depend on the rural economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that, on taking up office, the Government reintroduced the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes, schemes which were abolished by Deputy Yates when he served as Minister. He was supported in that by his Labour and Democratic Left colleagues. The Minister provided the funding for these schemes and paid the bills left outstanding by the previous Government in respect of those schemes. The control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes are very important from the point of view of bringing about necessary structural improvements, particularly on smaller farms. If it is possible for the Minister to review the schemes in the near future, I would advocate that the payment system under the control of farm pollution scheme should be modulated, whereby smaller scale producers would receive a higher level of grant assistance. I also hope that in future the maximum payment of £10,000 will be increased.</P>
    <P>One of the sectors currently facing difficulties is the sheep sector. The farm organisations have advanced the opinion that the stabiliser should be abolished and that the retention period should be staggered. I hope the Minister and the Department can give urgent consideration to those specific proposals. That might help to improve the sheep meat market.</P>
    <P>In the Border region in particular severe difficulties are being experienced in the pigmeat sector. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other public representatives from Monaghan, Donegal and Cavan have continually lobbied, together with individual farmers and farm organisations, to offset the severe difficulties faced by that sector, particularly since the end of June 1998. At that time a fire occurred in the Lovell and Christmas plant in Ballymoney, County Antrim, which was the main outlet for the slaughtering and processing of pigmeat in the Border counties. Unfortunately, since the fire there has not been adequate slaughtering or processing capacity in the northern part of the country and the pig producers in the region, particularly the smaller scale producers, are not getting the prices they should be getting for pigmeat. Serious difficulties have arisen for individual farmers. The Minister has met with various groups and Oireachtas Members on this point. He has succeeded, with the European Commission, in introducing the aids to private storage scheme and increasing export refunds. I urge the Minister to continue his efforts to ensure that we will never again have an inadequate slaughtering and processing capacity in the northern part of the country, in counties north and south of the Border. Many pig producers are experiencing serious financial difficulties and I hope it will be possible to introduce some scheme of assistance for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Minister is doing for agriculture at a very difficult time. He <Col N="147" /> referred particularly to the investment the Government made in 1998 in support of Irish farmers in the food sector and the rural development programme. I am glad this investment will continue under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals are one of the Minister's greatest successes. Great concern and anxiety surrounded the negotiations. We heard of proposals involving a loss of £1.386 billion. However, the final outcome resulted in a net gain in the seven years up to 2006 and that is to be welcomed. The Minister has experienced difficulties in regard to BSE, the closure of the Russian markets and bad weather. The Minister was very quick to introduce a £40 million fodder package, a package which, although not well received at first, resulted in more areas of the country than had been anticipated being included in the scheme following debate in this House and in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We experienced some very bad weather in September of this year although October was better. All Ministers will encounter these kinds of problems from time to time.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister introduced the farm assist scheme to help low income farm families. That scheme has been a great boon. The Minister referred to the fact that an increasing number of farmers are participating in off-farm employment. I do not know whether that is a positive or negative move. On the one hand, it shows that the economy is doing well but, on the other, it means that people are moving away from farming. The falling interest rates as a result of the economic boom have been very helpful to farmers.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of the Minister's speech related to the position of young farmers. Macra na Feirme campaigned for a long time for the reintroduction of the installation aid scheme and changes in the farm retirement scheme and I am glad the Minister has been able to meet its demands. I also welcome the changes in stock relief and land leasing, capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>The installation aid scheme was reintroduced at the end of 1998. The Minister has clearly stated that the scheme will be financed by the Exchequer over a three year period. Some 800 applications have already been received under the scheme and 290 young farmers have been paid a total of £1.6 million. It is very important for the future of agriculture that young farmers are supported. Their situation must be considered very seriously in the context of the national development plan. Many of the measures referred to by Fine Gael will be included in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Leader model of rural development and the establishment of new businesses and community development groups. The only difficulty we are experiencing in County Galway in this respect is a shortage of money which seems <Col N="148" /> to run out around the middle of the year. If there is surplus money available in other counties, I hope it will be redirected towards County Galway. I would like this issue addressed in the new Leader programme and I would like to see increased emphasis placed on the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose was very generous in his comments on the national beef envelope and the use of the £8.2 million to top up the £21 heifer slaughter premium. Heifers had been excluded from the scheme until now.</P>
    <P>The flooding problem in south County Galway does not come under the Minister's area of responsibility. However, he is aware from meeting farmers at the opening of the new mart in Gort that there are serious concerns about four particular areas. The Minister was informed that a sum of £1 million would be very helpful in tackling the problem in areas such as Kilchreest, Cregclare, Tarmon and Mannin Cross. I hope the Minister will provide that funding, which is a small amount in the larger financial context, in order to alleviate the flooding problem, particularly the flooding of good land.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is farcical that Opposition Members would table a Private Members' motion when they are really not aware of what is happening in the area of agriculture. This side of the House does not suffer from amnesia or problems of bilocation. We know where we are supposed to be. This Minister and his team in Agriculture House have been understanding and sympathetic and have not reacted to what has been happening in agriculture, but they have been proactive in looking at the future of agriculture and what we need to do after Agenda 2000 and the negotiations in which the Minister and his team have been involved in trying to get the best possible deal for farmers. It is not Fianna Fáil's fault we had bad weather, nor is it its fault there was a BSE crisis.</P>

      <P>It was not Fianna Fáil's fault that market forces changed. I am not saying it was Fine Gael's fault, but it did not do much about it when it had the chance. The Minister has made a tremendous impact in trying to address these problems. No one on this side will stand up and say everything is rosy in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheepmeat is important in a constituency such as mine where we rely very much on quite volatile markets for the export of our young lambs in particular. We also had considerable problems as regards prices in recent months. The reduction in prices is costing the small farmer in particular, many of whom in my constituency are totally reliant on sheep farming, between £8 and £10 per lamb. It is a severe loss and they are making no money on their lambs. They are expected to feed them with meal and nuts which is costing the <Col N="149" /> farmers money and, as a consequence, they may have to rethink the production of lamb next year.</P>
    <P>We met the IFA and it put some proposals to us of which the Minister indicated he is supportive, particularly in regard to ewe premium. I hope the Minister will get the support necessary in Europe and that the Commission will look at additionality, how the calculation of ewe premium takes place and also additionality as regards a supplementary premium. That is the only way we can deal with the immediate impact of price reduction. I am sure every Member of this House wonders why, although we are an export orientated country and produce the best quality, sheep and pigmeat is being imported? How will we address that problem if we have overproduction, particularly in pigmeat? Why is the country importing pigmeat and New Zealand lamb?</P>
    <P>The pig industry is on its knees. We met the Minister and were pleased with the meeting. We fully support him in trying to address this horrendous problem. Many aspects of the industry are supported by the Commission, but there is no support for the pig industry. I ask for a national support for the pig industry, in particular in the Border regions where in two or three years' time there will be no pig industry.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil seans agam labhairt anocht ar an rún atá romhainn. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. I commend the Minister and the Ministers of State on the successful negotiations on the Agenda 2000 agreement and their continued support for farmers. Schemes, such as the early retirement from farming scheme and the new installation aid scheme for young farmers, and incentives, such as stock relief, land leasing, tax relief on agriculture education and training programmes, assist in the handing down of family farms from the last generation to the next and offer young people the chance to run a viable business on a family farm. The REPS and the control of farmyard pollution scheme ensure that our environment is protected and preserved for further generations. These programmes have contributed greatly to rural development and many enterprises have been given assistance which help them to become thriving businesses in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening of the export market has greatly assisted farmers and gives our producers a valuable market for their produce. In 1998 there were 7.5 million cattle in this country and about eight million sheep. Since 1996 the number of vessels approved for the transport of live cattle has increased from nine to 17, in addition to the three roll-on/roll-off ferry services in operation. I note that in 1997 there were 57,000 live exports. From January to June of this year over 200,000 cattle were exported. This is as a result of the hard work and dedication of the Minister and Ministers of State. We should, however, put more effort into <Col N="150" /> processing our meat at home to the final product which can go straight into the supermarkets.</P>
    <P>Distribution of additional milk quota designed to help the smallholder should give those with low incomes the support they need to make their living on the land. Disease eradication is always uppermost in the minds of farmers and the Government has taken every step possible to ensure that our produce is top quality and reaches the consumer in its purest condition. Overall, the future of farming in Ireland is positive and the Minister has put in place the schemes and agreements which will bring farmers into the new millennium with confidence that their work will be valued and supported financially by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion by Fine Gael Deputies. A motion condemning the Government for its lack of understanding and support for farmers is a bit of a joke, particularly when tabled by those who, when in Government, treated farmers with contempt and succeeded in bringing confidence in the industry to a new low. The Minister is acutely aware of the importance of the agriculture industry to the national economy. His colleagues in Cabinet, particularly his parliamentary party, support him in his endeavours to fight the cause of the farmer to the bitter end. He is not confronted with a situation where a senior Minister in Government is of the opinion that Irish farmers are rolling in it. That was the attitude of a Minister in a Fine Gael led administration to problems facing farmers during the BSE crisis. It was a statement which went uncondemned by his Fine Gael colleagues in Government.</P>
      <P>An announcement on the eve of the last general election on the opening of the Egyptian market by the then Minister for Agriculture and Food was an insult to farmers and mere opportunism on the part of Fine Gael. The Minister has worked hard to try to secure markets for our cattle and beef. Ministerial and official delegations have visited Russia, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and the Gulf states. There have been no false declarations in relation to these visits. The Minister did not declare himself at Dublin Airport with people boarding a flight when he was elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food in the previous administration, the rainbow administration, had his hands tied and it was disastrous for Irish farming. It was during his term that the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes were brought to an end. I commend the Government on its commitment to agriculture. A vibrant farming sector is vital to the development of rural Ireland. The family farm is the cornerstone of rural society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going on its record, the Government will ensure that agriculture will make a greater than ever contribution to our economy. The sector has seen difficult times in recent years with the BSE <Col N="151" /> crisis, bad weather and economic setbacks in other parts of the world leaving farmers vulnerable. This Government has put a range of measures in place to help farmers through these difficulties. Policies implemented by this Government have ensured increased employment is available to all. An increasing number of farmers and their wives, if it suits their situation, can supplement their incomes through off-farm jobs. The Minister has adequately addressed the areas referred to in this motion. I compliment him on a variety of positive measures and achievements to date on the issues of concern to Deputies. I have no doubt this Government is committed to the future of our farmers and accusations to the contrary are without foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us reads like a well-crafted list of soundbites to attract maximum publicity, though it lacks any content, sincerity or vision. The real challenge to the Opposition is to bring forward a debate on their vision for the future of agriculture and rural life. It is not good enough to present a wish list in the hope that someone will believe one's case. Happily, the public is not that gullible.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise the need for radical change in the support and development of the agricultural sector if we are to secure the future of farming and ensure the industry is populated by young, dynamic and progressive farmers. Our markets need to be developed so that we deliver to the consumer the product that is being demanded in a way that associates excellence and quality with Irish farm produce. We do not do enough here from the factory to the supermarket shelf to secure that quality status and a world market. There are world markets available to us outside the traditional markets which we have served for years. We need a marketing strategy that will deliver our produce directly to the supermarket shelves and that is based on quality and excellence. We can no longer take any market for granted and there should be a strong emphasis in a new strategy on organic produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young farmers in particular need support and encouragement, but another group in agriculture should get special support. Elderly people living on farms, sometimes alone, having worked all their lives in agriculture, are now in a position where they have very little income and a poor quality of life. They do not enjoy the comforts of a successful economy and may be without their families. Many young people from such families have moved to more lucrative work in other sectors of the economy. These elderly people often live in hardship because farming is a way of life to them rather than a business. A special effort should be made in this year's budget to ensure they are looked after. State agencies, the Leader programme, local authorities and the Government have a collective role to play to establish the proper way forward. The energies of all these organisations must be harnessed if we are to suc<Col N="152" /> ceed. The White Paper on rural development is a starting point and I commend the Minister, Ministers of State and all who were involved in drawing up that document.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme has been a major success and its successor should be announced sooner rather than later. Substantial European and Exchequer funding is necessary to ensure the continuity of this programme beyond mid-2000. This announcement is needed now to give some comfort to the qualified people who have served in this scheme for many years and who are now very concerned for their future. I would welcome that announcement &ndash; with appropriate funding &ndash; sooner rather than later, as never before was such a structure required. Substantial European funding is needed and we need to target the different projects throughout the country to form a national plan and then every part of the country can benefit from the investment that should take place. I commend the Leader programme and acknowledge the work undertaken by the Department and the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for ensuring the House has the opportunity to debate agriculture and rural life in Ireland. The debate comes at the right time of year, the start of a new growing season, before the winter sets in and before the time which last year brought most hardship to farmers. We also have the opportunity to look ahead to the future for Irish farmers in the light of CAP II and Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
      <P>Everybody accepts that farming and rural life in Ireland is undergoing a period of real change, as it is throughout Europe. Rural communities accept this and will live and adapt with it. However, they will not accept the excess pain and suffering in their industry and livelihood that could have been avoided through support systems, imaginative Government policy and more aggressive negotiation at European level.</P>
      <P>My job in Opposition is to highlight the failures of the Government and hopefully spur the Minister into action in the areas I think he has neglected since taking office two and a half years ago. I have limited time and, therefore, will concentrate on the two sectors I know best, namely, the cereal sector and the future for young people in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cereal harvest was reasonably good this year from a yield point of view while from a price point of view it was similar to last year, that is, not particularly good but acceptable. However, the future looks very worrying as a result of the disappointing deal struck for Ireland under the CAP II negotiations in Europe before the summer. I think our negotiating team must take a <Col N="155" /> portion of the blame for this. It is now clear that at least five other countries in the negotiating process managed to receive special concessions for their countries in the grain and other sectors on the basis of their set of circumstances. However, the 16,000 Irish grain farmers received no concessions. Finland and part of Sweden, for example, received a grain drying subsidy worth £15 per tonne because they have a short growing season and high rainfall at 28 inches per annum. However, as the Minister knows, we have a rainfall level in County Cork of 42 inches per annum. Surely we had a case to make. Spain, Portugal and Italy managed to increase their reference yield for cereals, the figure for which in Ireland is 2.4 tonnes per acre. This is the figure used to calculate the level of arable area payments per acre by the EU. Our own cereal yields have increased in recent years, yet why have we made no attempt to increase our reference yield?</P>
    <P>Another example concerns Italy which managed to get concessions on milk quota because it had a milk net deficit. In other words they consume more than they produce and therefore do not export to other EU countries which would add to excess supply. However, Ireland produces less than half its grain requirements &ndash; we produce 1.8 million tonnes of grain but have a net requirement of approximately four million tonnes per year. Yet we do not get extra concessions in this area.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister and his team to devise realistic but persuasive reasons to get a better deal for Irish grain farmers, something he has not done. Many of the small and medium sized grain producers face a bleak future as prices are reduced in the next five years under Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the future for young people in farming. It is proving more and more difficult to persuade the young to stay in farming as a business and as a way of life. Over 4,000 families are leaving the land each year and many others are being forced to find alternative and secondary sources of income to remain financially buoyant. These are hardly the facts which will attract young people into an agricultural way of life when so many other businesses are booming. However, the Government does not seem to be helping the situation.</P>
    <P>There are two areas which need investment, namely, education and installation aid. The agricultural colleges are under pressure with high costs and falling numbers of students. Agricultural facilities need to be high quality and, therefore, need investment. The Government has given the agricultural colleges no grant aid and no financial support of any kind as far as I am aware.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on providing an opportunity to debate this issue. I would like to deal with the Leader programme and the future development of Leader Plus, the <Col N="156" /> new initiative for rural development. Currently £35 million has been allocated for Leader for the next seven years, a very disappointing figure. Leader to date has been a success, but there is uncertainty regarding its future in the context of staff being on temporary contracts.</P>
      <P>In County Sligo £2.5 million has been committed to private and community projects, an investment which will lever an additional £3 million in private funds, yielding an investment of over £5 million for development in the county. It is envisaged that in excess of 500 full-time jobs will be created as a result of such investment. The Leader programme has assisted community and private promoters in terms of rural tourism, small business, natural resources and environmental and cultural projects. One of the main elements of the Leader programme is the assistance it provides in terms of rural development, something which is most important given the crisis which exists in the agricultural sector and the survival of rural areas. The County Sligo Leader Partnership has adopted a proactive approach to this through the provision of outreach services in the rural parts of the county and the provision of assistance to groups and individuals which allows them take a professional approach to the development of their communities, something which will leave a lasting legacy.</P>
      <P>Alternative enterprises in terms of developing the farming sector are very important and the role of the Leader programme in this regard to date has been very successful. However, as I initially stated, the funding allocation of £35 million, that is £5 million per year over the coming years, is disappointing. The Exchequer must match these funds if Leader is to continue its great work.</P>
      <P>The starting point of all action under the local development programme is the principle of partnership and collective decision making. The distinguishing feature of its work is the deliberate emphasis it places on measures to combat and counteract long-term unemployment, something which is very important in rural areas, and to promote social inclusion. The Leader approach to local development is threefold, involving piloting, developing and testing new ways of tackling unemployment with a view to mainstreaming co-ordination and brokerage through linkage with influencing agencies which work in partnership. It has been a very successful role and the initiative in County Sligo has been very successful. A huge number of people have benefited from the Leader programme. In the context of the decline in agriculture, Leader has been quite effective in a very difficult period. Continued funding and a clear statement of what will happen the Leader programme is an issue of huge concern.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also consider food processing and retailing in terms of developments in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his initiative in bringing forward this <Col N="157" /> very important debate at a crucial time in agriculture. The sector is in a very depressed state and is in urgent need of intervention by the Minister who must, together with the Government, adequately finance agriculture and agricultural development, especially in the context of REPS, the age of farm retirement, on-farm investment, control of pollution grants and young farmer installation aid schemes. The Minister must address these issues over the next seven years through the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed dismally in the Limerick area in providing a service to deal with farm retirement pensions and installation aid grants and I ask him to address this. Earlier this year one of the officials of the Department in the office went on sick leave and nobody replaced him. The files were left unattended. This has led to an unacceptable situation where 65 files are awaiting processing and the waiting period is now three months. The waiting list in the neighbouring county of Cork is less than half that and the waiting period is six weeks. Similarly in Kerry, the waiting list is 24 and the waiting period is six weeks. In Clare there are just five files awaiting attention. I ask the Minister to provide immediately extra staff to clear the backlog in Limerick. The current situation is inexcusable.</P>
      <P>Agriculture continues to be one of the most important sectors of the economy but it is severely depressed at a time when all other areas of the economy are booming. Farmers are fearful for their continued existence and their families have no confidence in farming. Four thousand families are forced to leave farming each year and many more are forced to become part-time farmers and to take up outside employment to feed their families. This puts more pressure on the family.</P>
      <P>Young people are not going into farming. This is clear from the reduction in the number of students attending agricultural colleges. The Salesian College, Pallaskenry, County Limerick, had over 130 students in 1997. This dropped to 117 in 1998 and this year there are only 97 students. Mountbellew has 40 fewer students &ndash; down to 57 &ndash; than last year and Gurteen has 30 fewer students. It is predicted that Athenry will cease to provide agricultural training after this year. As a gesture, the Government should abolish stamp duty for young farmers and encourage them into agriculture.</P>
      <P>At a time when capital is freely available for investment in other sectors of the economy, it is not available in agriculture. Farmers with small and medium sized farms cannot get loans from their banks. This indicates a lack of confidence on the part of banks in agriculture and its future. The value of store farmers' stock has more than halved since 1997. If agriculture is to continue to play a major role in the economic and social life of the State, farmers must be given the opportunity to earn a decent living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is responsible for the survival of rural Ireland as we know it. The collapse of <Col N="158" /> agriculture will have a devastating effect on society. Farmers have always responded positively to change, but the present uncertainty will create difficulties for the survival of farm units. The Minister must fulfil his commitment to open the Libyan market. We have heard for more than two years that this market will reopen, but it has not yet done so. Thirteen years ago, when I was involved in the beef industry, beef cattle were realising between £1 and £1.20 per pound. Today they are realising 82p to 84p per pound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I compliment Deputy Connaughton on instigating it at this opportune time. Last night the Minister said the Opposition refused to recognise that the Government had done tremendous work over the past two and a half years in helping Irish farmers through a series of difficulties and putting the industry on a sound footing. This is an indication of how out of touch the Minister is with the crisis that exists in Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>Over those two and a half years the Minister failed to find a market for lamb, beef or pigmeat. Never before have these three major sectors been in such a state of depression at the same time. Lambs are at pre-1970 prices, beef cattle now average £300 less than they did five years ago and pigs are making half the price they made three years ago. To compound this disaster, the Minister of State threw in the towel. He told a conference in his constituency that people in rural areas would need jobs outside agriculture in future if the countryside is to &ldquo;thrive&rdquo;. I believe he meant to say survive. He continued by saying that the long-term trend is for the relative significance of conventional farming to decline. The Minister and the Minister of State have aided and accelerated the decline in agriculture. Will this statement inspire confidence in farming in the younger generation? Does the Minister subscribe to the same picture of agriculture's future?</P>
      <P>Let us recall the report last night on the actions of senior officials in Agriculture House. Will the Minister conduct an in-depth inquiry into the content of that report? Are the officials out of control and has the Minister ever indicated his concern about their antics? What chance has an ordinary farmer of getting a fair hearing about problems relating to grant schemes and EU entitlements under the regime that now exists in Agriculture House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 27,000 applications under the various schemes during the period 1992 to 1997 were refused. In some cases they were classified as fraudulent when, in truth, their only inaccuracy was the misplacement of a single digit on the form or the duplication of an animal's identification number. The over-zealous and arrogant attitude of some officers at senior level is strangling many schemes while, simultaneously, some of these officials are costing the taxpayer huge amounts of money in the course of defending the indefensible in court. I urge the Minister to con<Col N="159" /> sider requesting the resignation of the officials who have brought agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development into such disrepute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During a previous debate on agriculture I remarked that the lethargic, nonchalant, blasé and laid back approach adopted by the Minister and his colleagues would not solve the crisis in agriculture, and my remarks have been borne out. The sheep and pig sectors are in turmoil. As Deputy Neville said, beef was realising between 112p to 119p per pound a few years ago, now it is only realising 83p per pound. Milk production is also in decline and after 2005 the price of milk will decrease. Four thousand people are leaving the land every year and that trend is accelerating. Every day there are notices in the newspapers about another herd being sold. One sees people selling quotas of 50,000 gallons in a strong dairying area such as north Kerry even though there is a young person on the farm. No direction is being given in agriculture and there is no energy in the sector. People have lost their morale and their interest in farming.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister referred to the numerous unfortunate misunderstandings under which the Opposition labours regarding the main issues in agriculture. However, the evidence for the Opposition's arguments can be seen in the collapse in prices. With regard to the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the <i>Farmer's Journal</i> reported that it is generally acknowledged that the Irish input into the negotiations was of little significance. We achieved our concessions on the backs of the French. Were it not for their strong negotiating position, we would not have secured concessions. That is publicly acknowledged. The sheep sector, however, was ignored in those negotiations and we are now paying the penalty.</P>
      <P>I do not see the benefit of the farm assist programme in north Kerry where there is a large number of small farmers. I do not know where the Minister got the figure of 7,400. I agree with Deputy Connaughton's proposal to increase installation aid to £12,000. Young farmers are not being encouraged to go into farming and I urge the Minister to talk to the Minister for Finance with a view to doing something through the taxation system to encourage them.</P>
      <P>I set up Leader II when I was in office. I appeal to the Government to continue the Leader groups in their existing areas. At this stage they are well established and they should be allowed to continue in their present format. I also put huge emphasis on cattle breeding, but the same commitment has not been given to that area since I left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the agriculture industry has been abandoned by the Government. It has thrown in the towel. My colleagues have expressed their concerns about the price of <Col N="160" /> heavy cattle, sheep and pigmeat. I wish to deal with another area.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his team have the distinction of presiding over the closure of the only plant in the country which processed frozen vegetables. It was in Midleton. The Government did precious little to sustain or replace it. That is another nail in the coffin of the agriculture industry. Instead of expanding these plants and providing substanial support for farm produce, the Minister turned his back on them. He did not appear in Midleton, he passed very little comment on this and showed no interest in it.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme is another area that demands attention at this time. Leader groups around the country are upset because they do not know what the future holds for them. It is time the Government did some work in this area and made clear to the Leader companies and other community groups that rely on the Leader companies what its intentions are.</P>
      <P>Many of my colleagues have referred to the drift from the land, the fact that more and more young people are showing less interest in farming. Many older farmers who spent years building up their enterprises find that their children are no longer attracted to agriculture. I appeal to the Minister and his officials to examine this area. If young people do not go into agriculture, there will not be a future for the industry, bad and all as the industry is at present. The Minister has a great deal of work to do in the next short while he will remain in office, to try to rescue the agriculture industry from almost certain oblivion unless he gets his act together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate, the subject of which is always an important one, particularly in the present climate. I support the motion introduced by Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on the chairmanship of the agricultural committee this afternoon. That will go a long way towards restoring honesty, decency and integrity in this House and confidence among the farming community.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects of farming about which I am particularly concerned, which have been brought to the Minister's attention on more than one occasion. One is the plight of pig farmers in my constituency and the Border region. Sympathy is no longer any good. What is needed is a rescue package, as those farmers are facing bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> The other aspect about which I am concerned is the plight of small farmers. I refer to farmers who have less than 50 acres of land and whose farms are not yielding an income. I stand over the strong statement that farm families are going hungry. Children are hungry going to school and students attending third level colleges in this city and regional colleges are going hungry because <Col N="161" /> their family farms are not yielding an income to support them.</P>
    <P>The farm assist scheme has not worked. I accept that moneys were set aside &ndash; perhaps £20 million or £30 million for that purpose, but officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs do not understand farming. Counting the eggs on the dresser is of no help in terms of giving assistance to these families who are in dire straits. No income is coming into these farm households for six months of the year, from May when the last of the previous year's headage payments come in until they start again in November. Given the small size of these farms, only a limited number of cattle can be sold.</P>
    <P>How can these families live without an income? Yet the Minister's officials assess that these farmers have a weekly income of £150 or £200. If these farmers had that income they would not be seeking benefit under the farm assist scheme. These farmers are decent people, not beggars. Will the Minister get that message across to the officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? We should support these family farms, which are the backbone of rural Ireland. These farm families are the honest, decent people who brought the country to the level it is at today, which enables our young people to reap the benefit of their input. Surely they are entitled to a fair income, the same as everybody else. Farmers who have reached middle age cannot adapt to or get another job. They are tied to their farms and they must be supported. I implore the Minister to talk to his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, and ask him to take his officials aside and to talk commonsense to them.</P>
    <P>On the schemes for headage premium and other premiums, the Minister should not treat farmers as criminals. We all make mistakes. The Minister makes mistakes, I make them, but if a farmers makes one he is deemed a criminal and a person who is trying to deceive. Anyone can make a mistake, especially when one is checking cattle under some of the farm conditions where there are not proper holding conditions. Tag numbers can be read wrong, the sex of the animal can be reported incorrectly, but that is not done deliberately. If one was to visit a farm, one would see the cattle are there. Farmers should not be treated as criminals or penalised by adopting the big stick attitude towards them and suspending for two years the minimal payments they get that are so necessary. They should be treated with a little more compassion. Everybody would benefit from that. Money invested in rural Ireland is spent locally. It benefits shops and small businesses and enables the country to prosper.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in office at a time when farming as a career and a way of life is rapidly disappearing because young people are not going into farming. The Minister might say that is not his fault, but neither he nor his Department has done anything to change that situation. My <Col N="162" /> colleagues pointed out that under various headings, including the farm installation grant and stamp duty, every possible blockade is put in the way of farmers. There are road blocks everywhere. That is the work of the Department. The Minister must shake up his Department and ensure his officials, especially the inspectors, address problems in this area.</P>
      <P>In Longford the position with regard to REPs inspectors is disastrous. Two farmers waiting for months for inspections to be carried out, contacted me recently and the inspections have yet to be carried out. I ask the Minister to ensure sufficient staff is employed to carry out such inspections.</P>
      <P>One farmer who happens to fall into the 5 per cent category has to wait six months to have an inspection carried out while another farmer who does not need to have an inspection carried out has already got paid. That is another example of what is wrong in agriculture. Who would want to be involved in an industry and treated like that by the Government?</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville pointed out that some counties are not as badly off as others. I ask the Minister to check out the blackspots tomorrow morning after he has taken one of the eggs off the dresser for breakfast.</P>

      <P>It gives me no pleasure to have to rise in this Chamber this evening in support of the motion tabled &ndash; far from it. I would, as should all objective opinion, much prefer to be able to recognise the grand claims in the amendment in the Minister's name, which laud his and his Government's efforts to deal with the many and varied problems currently affecting the broad farming community in this State, but I cannot and I suggest he cannot sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the short speaking opportunity available to me, I will reflect on only one area of great need at this time. Following a meeting last Wednesday with myself and other Border county Deputies and Senators, the Minister is fully aware of the dire circumstances of the pig farmers of Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. They are some 94 in number and they face economic ruin and the subsequent toll that will exact on their health and well-being and on the future of their children. It is a small number perhaps, but let no one be tempted to view this issue as marginal or less important for that. It is a crisis. It arises from the exceptional losses incurred by these farmers who were dealt body blow after body blow with the closure of traditional processing outlets in the north-east, with the subsequent fire in the Ballymoney plant in June last year, and the exploitative stance taken by those outlets who saw their desperation and paid below market prices for their produce while their counterparts elsewhere continued to enjoy the then best available returns. There are no second class pig farmers in this economy; they are all entitled to equal and fair treatment. I call on the Minister again to approve &ndash; without first recourse to Brussels &ndash;<Col N="163" /> a financial rescue package that will allow these producers regain a toehold into that sector and into that industry. We cannot and must not allow their downfall and ruination. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the chance to respond to this debate. I have listened with interest to the contributions of Deputies from all sides of the House and I will deal with some of the detailed issues in a few minutes.</P>
      <P> I will begin with the all important issue of funding from the European Union and national resources, which is absolutely essential if we are to properly support our farmers and rural communities. The Government has successfully steered the Agenda 2000 negotiations in the agriculture sector to a successful conclusion while at the same time ensuring that EU budget arrangements are in place for the implementation of the national development plan for the years 2000 to 2006. The full details of EU and national funding will be available in that plan when it is published later this month.</P>
      <P>Both the Agenda 2000 agreement and the national development plan have benefited from the partnership approach which is a fundamental feature of this Government's policy. These two major landmarks are highly visible evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to the agriculture, food and rural development sectors. Alongside these landmarks, the Department has continued to provide direct and indirect financial support to its clients both from the European Union and the national budgets, with an overall annual expenditure of £2 billion pounds.</P>
      <P>This budgetary expenditure is paralleled by an increasing involvement by the Department in the regulatory areas for the monitoring of standards of food production and processing. These policies and operations are being implemented in an ever-changing national and international framework for food production and trade. The Government and my Department are vigilant in responding to changing agricultural circumstances, particularly those international situations over which little control, if any, can be exercised by any one country, particularly a country such as Ireland with its continuing dependence on exports and on a limited number of sectors for its agricultural well-being.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis in Britain from 1996 onwards, with its beef safety implications, had repercussions in all livestock and meat sectors and these repercussions are still being dealt with at national and international level. The economic setbacks in the Far East and Russian markets are still adversely affecting our agricultural markets. Poor weather conditions cannot be planned for in advance but, as in the case of last year, were effectively dealt with by the Government with a fodder package of over £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Shortfalls in EU budget resources for ongoing Irish schemes were dealt with by national financing, following EU approval. As Deputies are aware, my Department is subject to the administrative budget agreements which are now an integral part of successive Governments' policies on public expenditure. These budget agreements have practical implications for the delivery of schemes and services. Difficulties and delays sometimes occur and these will continue to be dealt with on an ongoing basis as and when they arise.</P>
    <P>In so far as specific agricultural sectors are concerned, I acknowledge that the sheep and pig sectors are going through difficult times at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with that in detail last night. He has been endeavouring to deal with the matter over a period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>My position on both sectors is clearcut. I will continue to press for changes in the EU market regimes for these two products to take account of these difficulties.</P>
      <P>I will follow up on a number of specific questions raised by Deputies and I will communicate directly with them. As Deputies are aware, I recently launched the Government White Paper on Rural Development, entitled, Ensuring the Future: A Strategy for Rural Development in Ireland. For the first time a detailed exposition of Government policy on the various elements relevant to the needs of rural communities is readily available. The Government's policy will be reflected in the national development plan. As the recognised lead Department in the rural development sector, my Department will provide specific resources to implement Government policy and to ensure a co-ordinated approach across Departments. Other political and administrative structures are provided for, consisting of a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach and comprising Ministers and Ministers of State whose policy responsibilities impinge on rural development and an interdepartmental policy committee comprising senior officials of relevant Departments who will report directly to the Cabinet sub-committee. The input of local and regional authorities, the social partners, local development bodies and the wider voluntary and community sector to rural development policy issues will be assured through a national rural development forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farming community can look to the future with increased confidence because of the actions taken and the policies being followed by this Government. The Agenda 2000 agreement is in place, a White Paper on Rural Development has been published and the national development plan will be published later this month. There will <Col N="165" /> be a Leader Plus programme and national resources will be provided in addition to those provided by the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Browne and Connaughton.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on tabling this motion which is timely. Deputy Neville referred to the difficulties in the Limerick office. The official who handles the installation aid and farm retirement schemes is a gentleman to deal with. The Minister responded recently to queries about the farm retirement scheme and he outlined the average waiting times for every county. There is a difficulty in the Limerick area where it takes an average of five months to process farm retirement grants. When parliamentary questions are tabled, the response is always the same &ndash; the delay will not restrict the overall amount paid and retrospection will be considered. However, that is not much use to farmers. I ask the Minister to consider this matter. I question whether the Department deploys its resources effectively because in County Cork the number of farm retirement grants processed has trebled and the average waiting period is only six weeks. There is a big difference between six weeks and five months. What has happened to the principles of the farmers charter to expedite such issues? The Minister should look at the specific difficulties in the Limerick office.</P>
      <P>I criticise the deployment of resources. In the mid-west region there are 200 staff in the Limerick office, 80 staff in the Ennis office and 54 staff in the Nenagh office. Both Ennis and Nenagh are approximately 25 miles from Limerick city. A Government building in Newcastle West was built a few years ago, but only one member of staff is employed there on a part-time basis two days a week. Yet the Minister had the gall to say to me in a recent reply that the people of Newcastle West were getting a fitting service from the local office. That is nonsense. The farmers in west Limerick are extremely critical of the fact they must drive to the agricultural office in Limerick city and run the risk of getting a parking fine if they park on a double yellow line. That is no way to treat people and is in direct conflict with the farmers charter. I ask the Minister to address this issue. I know of officials in the Department office in Limerick who would give their right arm to work in west Limerick. This would be an effective deployment of resources and it would also show the commitment of the Department to facilitate the people of Newcastle West The county council recently embarked on a £1 million development of a new office there to sustain the local area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our poultry industry is worth £120 million. Approximately one third of our poultry is imported, a significant amount of which comes from European Union countries. An increasing amount of poultry products are imported from Thailand and Brazil and other countries outside the European Union. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland must ensure that proper controls are in <Col N="166" /> place. The Minister may be aware that a number of British parliamentarians recently visited Thailand and were extremely critical of its poultry processing industry. Yet poultry products from such countries are sold alongside Irish products. Multiples such as Tesco and Dunnes Stores rely on quality audits carried out by Department officials in the processing unit to ensure that such products are of good quality. Yet 30 factory units in Thailand are approved under the EU rules. Not one of those factories was subject to an EU inspection in order to achieve that standard. There are not any 'on the spot' inspections. In the interests of the consumer, the country of origin should be shown on all products sold here. In that way consumers would know whether a product was made in Brazil, Ireland, Thailand and so on. They would have freedom of choice when purchasing goods. Products should be properly labelled. People should be more conscious of the products on sale nowadays. We had a recent scare with dioxins in Belgium and sewage being fed in France. The Irish consumer who does not look for a quality Irish product is foolish.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about the rural document and I appreciate that it has been produced. It is significant as far as sustaining people in rural Ireland is concerned. I am a director of a Leader group and I know of the excellent work done by these groups. However, there is uncertainty now as most groups have run out of money and cannot allocate grants. In many cases industries or products more suited to Leader programmes are being referred to county enterprise boards which have limited funds.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> On a previous occasion I quoted speeches the Minister made while he was in Opposition. They sounded very well and were good even when I read them but they had no effect on the Minister. I will not quote from them tonight. He has been reminded of what he has not done. Will the Minister please ignore the advice of his backbenchers? It is quite clear that some of them have not even seen a farmer in the past five years let alone spoken to one. They are living in a land that seems to be flowing with milk and honey. I do not see any difference for the farmers in Carlow or Kilkenny, be they Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. If they are sheep or pig farmers they are on their knees. Beef farmers are also in trouble. That the backbenchers can speak about them in such glowing terms means they are living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should deal with his Department which is over-officious in dealing with farmers who make simple mistakes. I know of a widow who paid someone to cut her hedges under the REPS. He did it the wrong way and she has been thrown out of the scheme and must pay £800 back money. A young farmer whose wife put down a wrong number for one of the animals was hammered by the Department officials. Everything else was perfect and it was obvious it was a mistake. People who saw the <i>Prime Time</i> programme <Col N="167" /> last night must be sick to the teeth knowing that not one person in the Department will suffer the loss of a day's pay. Instead the officials will probably be promoted. It is time sanity reigned in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and people who make obvious, simple, innocent mistakes are not punished as if they had perpetrated a fraud.</P>
    <P>I heard the Independent Deputies being complimented last night on the brave stand they were taking in voting against Partnership for Peace. The farmers in Donegal, Wicklow or south Kerry will not be called upon to march to Europe to keep peace but they will be asked to survive on the miserable prices they receive for their sheep. I appeal to the brave Independents to show some interest in their constituents by voting for this motion and to stop acting the fool, voting for something they know cannot be defeated when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are voting for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Deputies and the Minister and Minister of State who contributed to the debate. I was amazed at the comments made by Fianna Fáil backbenchers. They know well what is happening as does the Minister. Their view is that agriculture is good but farming is bad. Neither of them had spoken for two minutes before they said the pig, sheep and cattle farmers are doing badly. What is left? If I were a store cattle farmer, a small milk producer, a pig or sheep farmer I would be even more worried by what the Minister said last night. He does not have any answers. There are some things the Minister does not have control over and we all acknowledge that. However, what he did for sheep farmers on the night of Agenda 2000 was despicable. The only flag he raised was a white one. He has made it extremely difficult to get a balanced approach to the ewe premium scheme. It is hugely irresponsible for the Minister to expect farmers with sheep to count them for extensification purposes and not pay them. Farmers hold the Minister responsible for that. There was no one else to help them that night in Brussels and the Minister did not do anything for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a serious allegation in the <i>Prime Time</i> programme against the Department and its handling of the Emerald Meats case. I did not know much about the case but the programme, <Col N="168" /> which was excellently presented, provided an opportunity to see how the Department acted and the public is not impressed by what it saw. At the earliest possible opportunity the Minister should give an indication of the grounds on which his Department decided to bring an appeal to the Supreme Court, given what happened in the High Court and what Mr. Justice Costello said. It seems as if the taxpayer will be exposed to a huge settlement figure and in view of that it is extraordinary that the case should be dragged on for so long.</P>
    <P>Farming families have always had dignity and long may that remain so. They are taking a terrible battering at present. They have great respect for their industry but for whatever reason &ndash; I do not think it is the Minister's view &ndash; whatever is happening in the Cabinet, it does not appear that the Minister wants to help farmers in their hour of need. It is very easy to help an industry when it is doing well. Thankfully, for all our sakes, many sectors in the economy are booming but the Minister does not seem to be able to deliver the necessary assistance and commitment to farming families in their greatest hour of need. Everyone knows the farming community was the original Celtic tiger. The agriculture industry carried this country for many years. It is not a good idea for the Government to turn its back on old friends. At every forum at every level across the country everyone agrees that the Government has turned its back on the farming community.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Fianna Fáil backbenchers to vote against the motion but the Independents have said on many occasions over the past two years that they would not be in the Dáil but for the small farmers in their constituencies. I put it to them, particularly those in sheep rearing areas, Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox, Blaney and Gildea, if they have any respect for the farmers who voted for them, tonight is the night to give the Government a shock. If they have any respect for the farmers who elected them to this House as Independents, tonight is the night to give the Government a shock. It will not change the Government but at least it will show their constituents and small farmers they are prepared to put pressure on it. If they do not do that, God help the people whom everybody aspires to help. This House is the place to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. The independent living movement, which was founded in 1972 in Berkeley, California, has as its aim to enable and empower people with disabilities to take control of their own lives. The first centre for independent living in Ireland was launched in Dublin in 1992. Waterford's centre for independent living is linked both to the national and international independent living movement. It was established in 1995. The setting up of the centre for independent living in Waterford has been of great benefit to people with physical disabilities. Not least of these benefits is the provision of personal assistants under the FÁS community employment scheme. Whereas remarkable progress has been made in terms of improving dramatically the quality of life for dis<Col N="171" /> abled people, a permanent long-term system is still not in place. Those between the ages of 21 and 35 who have had 52 weeks continuous unemployment can have one year on the community employment scheme. Those aged 35 or over who have three years continuous unemployment or three years including unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, one parent family allowance, a FÁS course or previous community employment scheme, can have three continuous years. The problem is that people who develop competence as personal assistants, at the end of one or three years as the case may be, are no longer available and there is a difficulty at present recruiting suitable people under the community employment scheme. The situation is becoming critical.</P>
      <P>Another initiative under the Waterford Centre for Independent Living in September 1998 was the launching of Waterford Vantastic. This relates to a wheelchair accessible door to door transport service. A fully adapted vehicle is now in operation in the city and other surrounding areas. It is capable of carrying two wheelchair users and three seated passengers. The service operates six days a week and on Sundays by request. It is clear that the Waterford Centre for Independent Living with the assistance of FÁS has in the short period of its existence provided a great change in terms of services for the physically disabled. To ensure that the service prospers and expands, there is a need for an independent living fund in the Waterford area. It has been demonstrated beyond doubt that people require the services provided.</P>
      <P>The areas in which the personal assistants operate are personal care, household duties and escort for business or social activities. Services can also be provided for students, thus enabling them to attend college. The tasks also undertaken by personal assistants include gardening, household maintenance, cooking, driving, assistance with exercise routines and social escort. I understand that although FÁS has allocated 14 CE places to the Waterford Centre for Independent Living this year, only 11 people are currently involved as personal assistants. It is imperative that there is an intervention which will provide for the long-term viability of the scheme and in particular, where people are no longer available under CE, that a structure is put in place where they can be retained within the activities of the Waterford Centre for Independent Living.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely cruel and unacceptable if people who had the benefit of services were denied them because of bureaucratic and administrative constraints. I call on the Minister to ensure that the appropriate intervention is made as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, I am pleased to have this oppor<Col N="172" /> tunity to clarify the matter of the provision of funding to the voluntary sector in respect of services provided by it to people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the first instance the health boards have responsibility for the provision of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In accordance with section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, health boards may contribute to the expenses of voluntary agencies providing services, similar or ancillary to a service which the health board itself may provide. Accordingly, State funding to voluntary agencies providing services to people with physical and sensory disabilities is provided by way of section 65 funding through the health boards.</P>
      <P>Each health board has a regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. These committees comprise representatives of the health boards, voluntary sector service providers, the consumer and the National Rehabilitation Board. They provide a structure designed to promote partnership between the statutory and voluntary sectors. One of the functions of the co-ordinating committee is to advise the health boards on priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities in the board's functional area.</P>
      <P>The Centre for Independent Living was established in Dublin in 1992 and is involved in a number of activities for people with disabilities encompassing housing, access and mobility, legislation, image, perception and terminology of disability and international relations. CIL advocates the promotion of independent living through the use of personal assistants, fielded by means of an independent living fund. The Centre for Independent Living currently has 25 centres nationwide. A total of 22 of the centres are providing personal assistance services through the use of the FÁS community employment scheme. There are five CIL branches based in the South Eastern Health Board area, one of which is the Waterford Centre referred to by Deputy O'Shea. The Centre for Independent Living is represented by the Disability Federation of Ireland on the South Eastern Health Board's co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Government's policy in relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable them to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. These services are being developed in line with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996. The report of the review group sets out in detail the requirements for the maintenance and development of a range of services, such as respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports, including personal assistance services. <Col N="173" /> The objective of the policy is to develop this range of services as a whole, in accordance with the availability of funding. The priority to be given to any particular service or services is a matter for each health board in accordance with local needs.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office, a total of almost £37 million by way of additional funding has been invested in the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year, a total of £13.4 million additional funding was provided of which £3 million was for the development of services. I point out the £3 million allocated for development this year will rise to £6 million on a full year cost basis in 2000.</P>
    <P>Each health board decided, in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services, on priorities for the allocation of this funding in its functional area. It is a matter for each health board to decide on the priorities appropriate in its own area for the allocation of this funding. As I indicated, such decisions are taken in consultation with the voluntary sector and consumers through the co-ordinating committees. It is a matter for the local health board to assist in this area.</P>

      <P>The mid-Louth area encompasses Ardee, Dunleer, Castlebellingham, Annagassan and Clogherhead and the issue I wish to raise revolves around those areas of population. In recent years and particularly in recent weeks, there has been a serious upsurge in anti-social behaviour in the area and this problem is escalating. The elderly and vulnerable families feel threatened, isolated and under siege. They are living in constant fear of break-ins and robberies and the threat of physical violence is ever present. There was an example recently where an elderly man in the Dunleer area was beaten up by a gang of violent thugs near his home and subsequently hospitalised.</P>
      <P>People feel there is an inadequate number of gardaí in the area to cope. I am asking the Minister to initiate an immediate review of the position. I hope he will be in a position to allocate additional gardaí to the area without delay. The people of mid-Louth need the Minister's help immediately. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I look forward to a positive response. It was a great mistake in our analysis of these problems to assume that anti-social behaviour is confined to large urban centres. Our experience in County Louth is that it is not by any means confined to large urban areas. There is much of it in rural areas and this is why I raised this matter on the Adjournment. I hope the Minister will be in a position to help.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter, which is of concern to his constituents. The House will be aware that the Government is especially committed to the fight against crime. To tackle crime in all its forms, from minor offences to the most serious forms of organised criminal activity, it is vital that the Garda Síochána has the necessary resources to carry out its duties.</P>
      <P>I have already put in place a number of provisions to ensure that the best resources and equipment are available to the Garda Síochána. I am very encouraged by the many successful Garda operations in recent times and I am committed to consolidating this success by ensuring that the gardaí are provided with adequate resources to continue this good work. I have recently provided extra funding for the purchase of additional cars for the gardaí to ensure greater speed and efficiency in dealing with crime.</P>
      <P>Among the longer term measures which I have put in place is the provision of extra funding to cover the cost of the recruitment of additional gardaí as part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to increase Garda numbers. Since I took up office the strength of the force has increased from 10,800 to 11,365 and we are on target to achieve a strength of 12,000 by the end of 2002. These initiatives have already begun to reap results in that there was a reduction of over 6 per cent in crime figures for 1998 and current trends indicate that this reduction is continuing for 1999.</P>
      <P>With regard to the area of mid-County Louth, mentioned by the Deputy, provisional crime trends show a decline in crime for the period January to September 1999 compared with the same period in 1998 as follows: Dunleer, less than 28 per cent; Ardee, less than 20 per cent; Collen, less than 8 per cent; Castlebellingham, less than 34 per cent; and Clogherhead, less than 21 per cent. Provisional crime trends do not reflect a growth in anti-social behaviour although there have been recent incidents of criminal damage in Castlebellingham and Dunleer sub-district which are at present under investigation. While the situation is generally positive, we cannot be complacent and must continue to combat crime and anti-social behaviour. This is not a job just for the gardaí but for the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to resources, both Castlebellingham and Clogherhead manpower strength increased by one member in 1998, Ardee manpower strength increased by one member in 1999 and the strength of all stations is now considered to be at optimum level. Four official vehicles are allocated to the relevant stations which are utilised in patrolling the mid-County Louth area and policing of the area is augmented as required by other resources from within the Louth-Meath division. The local divisional officer is satisfied <Col N="175" /> that the present manpower strength is adequate to meet the demands placed upon it. The policing arrangements in place are constantly reviewed to meet changing demands. I assure Deputy Kirk that if additional resources are required I will hold discussions with the Garda Commissioner to ensure they are provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the school transport problem affecting children in the Glanmire-Knockraha area who are attending second level school in Carrigtwohill. Nine children are being refused public school transport from the Riverstown-Knockraha area on the grounds that they should attend Glanmire community college, which is in the catchment area. Children attending Carrigtwohill last year were initially refused public school transport, but were subsequently accepted on a school bus.</P>
      <P>The parents of the nine children involved applied to County Cork VEC last May. The fees were accepted in July when an invoice from Bus Éireann was received. The acceptance of the money indicated their applications were accepted. Having paid the fees for the school transport, some of the parents bought the necessary uniforms and books required for that school.</P>
      <P>However, unfortunately, on 13 August, just ten days before the commencement of the new school year, the parents were informed that their children would not be taken on the school bus to Carrigtwohill and this has caused major problems. I am informed there are insufficient places in Glanmire community college to accommodate all nine children. This means that in the Knockraha area, for example, some of the children of one family have been collected by the bus, while one child is left by the side of the road and must be taken by private car to the college at substantial cost to the family. Another family is paying £50 per week in taxi fares to transport a child to and from the college. In consequence the family, which is in rented accommodation, is now about to move to a house in Carrigtwohill.</P>
      <P>The families decided to send their children to school at Carrigtwohill because of assurances given by the school authorities that the school bus problem had been resolved. I am informed this assurance was given at an open night in the school on 8 December 1998. Will the Minister of State advise if at one stage two buses travelled to the school at Carrigtwohill? Is it the case that at present only one bus travels to the school and that it is, at times, over-crowded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If rules exist parents should be informed as soon as possible of the decision of the local school transport authority, in this case County Cork VEC. In this instance all appeared to be in order when the VEC accepted the parents' application and they were subsequently invoiced by Bus Éireann. If Bus Éireann sent invoices to the parents, the VEC must have accepted the children. <Col N="176" /> Why was that decision approved initially and then reversed?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate what happened to the report commissioned by me when I was Minister of State in his Department? The report was received by the Department in May or June 1997. What decision or action has been taken on the review of the school transport system? It was overdue by five or six years, but now that it has been undertaken what has happened regarding the implementation of the report's recommendations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>This gives me the opportunity to outline the position in relation to school transport for pupils from the Glanmire-Knockraha area to St. Aloysius College. By way of general comment I should explain some basic facts about the school transport scheme, which will be well known to the Deputy as he administered the scheme when he was Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of the Department, has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 154,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country. My Department has responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money spent on this service. It does not come cheaply. In 1998 the net cost to the State was in excess of £40 million.</P>
      <P>One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside are eligible under the scheme for transport to that centre.</P>
      <P>While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, it is not the object of the scheme to facilitate parents in exercising that choice. The position in this case is that Glanmire-Carrigtwohill has been a common catchment area since the erection of Glanmire community school in 1997. Pupils who reside in the common catchment area and are over three miles from the nearest post-primary school are eligible for transport to their school of choice within the common catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the pupils concerned reside less than three miles from their nearest post-primary school, Glanmire community college. In the circumstances, they are not basically eligible for transport under the school transport scheme and, accordingly, it is not open to my Department to offer them transport to St. Aloysius College. While being sympathetic to the needs of the pupils concerned, my Department must consider the operation of the scheme as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines, which <Col N="177" /> would have financial and policy implications for the transport service overall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen raised a number of questions. I will investigate the Deputy's advice that the tickets were already issued and a commitment made and communicated to him.</P>
    <P>He also asked me to check if there were two buses initially which have been replaced by one bus. I will also check that. He asked about the School Transport Review Committee report. If Deputy Allen will recall, the report's main recommendation was that children with disabilities should be accommodated in terms of harnesses, escorts, etc. It recommended that charges be increased and that two thirds of the money received should be spent on that sector. We have managed to accommodate that sector without increasing charges. A few outstanding matters remain to be achieved which were recommended by the School Transport Review Committee. I have applied to the Government under the current Estimates negotiations for funding to implement these recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, the Minister for Education and Science announced that remedial teachers would be provided for all primary schools, not just in County Meath but throughout the country. Since September 1999, it has come to my attention from parents of children who need remedial teachers that extra teachers have not been appointed but that the teacher who visited three schools on a daily and weekly basis was given the job of visiting two further schools in the north Meath area. The details were astounding, to say the least. When the teacher got to the fifth school, she had ten minutes to deal with each pupil following an exhausting day travelling. The Government has made a decision to provide remedial teaching to every school throughout the country but each child available for remedial teaching is now obtaining less remedial teaching than he received last year. I am very surprised at this. The Minister seemed genuine in his announcement in this House and during discussions at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, of which I am vice-chairman, about the system being put in place last September to ensure a better remedial service for children who need remedial teaching throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is now in place, what the children of County Meath have, what the parents of children who require remedial teaching throughout the country have, is a far worse service than existed when the Minister took up office. Is it acceptable to put this pressure on teachers, parents and children? Teachers are now travelling throughout the country like racing drivers. They were under enough pressure already but they are now much worse off as a result of the decision made in September by the Minister for Education and Science. On behalf of all the children throughout the country, apart from those children in County <Col N="178" /> Meath and the parents who have spoken to me about this, when will the Minister alleviate the problem and provide decent remedial teaching for the children who require it at primary level?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the priorities of the Government was to improve the level of educational support given to pupils with special educational needs because it was aware that many pupils with special educational needs did not have access to an appropriate level of support. I consider that the Government's commitment in this is clearly demonstrated by the significant expansion of the remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>The primary focus will always be to prevent literacy and numeracy difficulties and to help children within each class. Primary teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The majority of pupils with remedial needs are helped within the scope of the normal teaching service. This has been clearly established as the most effective and important approach. However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under achievement in primary schools. Remedial teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with less serious learning difficulties by directly teaching individuals or small groups or, crucially, acting as a leader in the class and school approach to helping every child achieve high literacy and numeracy standards. Where individual pupils are concerned, it is important that the educational response takes a variety of forms and should be tailored to meet the needs of the individual pupil.  </P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently announced a major expansion of the remedial teaching service in first and second level schools. The priority was to ensure that all schools which were without a service would have access to one with effect from September 1999. Since then an additional 160 remedial teacher posts have been sanctioned to primary schools to ensure that all schools have access to a remedial service. This brings the total number of remedial teachers currently in place to 1,463.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this represents a huge ongoing investment in remedial services. The caseload assigned to the new appointees is fully in line with the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee report. Overall the number of remedial teachers in schools are in line with this and international guidance. The recommended caseload is 40 eligible pupils in the case of a single post, this to be reduced by two pupils for each additional school in the cluster, subject to a maximum reduction of eight pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister has published a comprehensive review of the remedial service which outlines very significant areas which need to be addressed to improve its impact in our schools. As has already been said, we must all <Col N="179" /> make sure that we are using the remedial service properly and in a whole school context. We cannot have a situation where we fail to address underlying problems by simply calling for the ongoing expansion of the number of remedial posts in the system. This is not to suggest that there are not schools with insufficient coverage, but if we believe that more teachers is the answer to everything to do with remedial provision, we will never address the remedial problems in our schools.</P>
    <P>All national schools in County Meath have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-<Col N="180" /> time or shared basis. There are a total of 39 remedial teachers serving these schools. The breakdown is as follows: 15 teachers serving one school, six serving two schools, ten serving 30 schools, six serving 24 schools, one serving five schools and one serving six schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been informed that the remedial service in the County Meath area is in general significantly within the expert guidelines outlined above. In the context of an adjustment to the manner of allocating such posts, such deficiencies as may be identified could be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 November 1999.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government mandated Aer Lingus to enter negotiations with American Airlines and British Airways with a view to concluding an operational strategic alliance as soon as possible subject to satisfactory due diligence, documentation and regulatory approvals and with a commitment that these airlines will sponsor Aer Lingus membership of the Oneworld alliance of airlines.

      <P>By the end of this year it is expected that some £80 million will have been invested in rail safety, which is in line with the provision in the programme. In terms of physical works completed I can give the Deputy the following information.</P>
      <P>Up to the beginning of this week over 72 miles of the planned 85 miles of track renewal for 1999 had been completed.

    <P>In relation to safety management Iarnród Éireann now has six corporate safety standards approved and issued this year, with another one due for approval and issue in the near future and another in preparation. A further two corporate safety standards are due to be completed by next March. The company also has 16 railway safety <Col N="184" /> standards in place and 14 in preparation. A range of new safety related management structures is also now in place. A very substantial training programme is under way with almost 20,000 person-days of safety-related training provided by end September.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Carrickfinn Airport in Donegal is supported by the Government by way of a public service obligation route under the essential air services programme. The daily air service to Dublin is currently operated by Aer Arann and a condition of the scheme is that the maximum fare is limited to £89. The current scheme is for a three year period, which ends in early 2001, but I am, of course, keeping any proposals in relation to a new PSO scheme under review.</P>
      <P>The catchment area of Derry Airport does, of course, encompass the east and north east of Donegal and this presents a further air transport corridor for the people of these areas. Under the Peace and Reconciliation Programme, a total of £1.528 million in aid was allocated to that airport in July last from my Department's Vote towards the cost of a runway extension and assorted works.</P>

      <P>I intend to place a copy of the Indecon report, edited of confidential commercial information, in the Oireachtas Library. My Department has paid an estimated £80,000 to Indecon in respect of this report, which I believe will be of considerable assistance to the regulator when he or she is appointed.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of applicants did not receive share certificates or nominee statements for some time after 14 July 1999. The delays arose for a variety of reasons, including transmission delays in the postal system and applications that had either insufficient address details or required extra processing.</P>
      <P>About 570,000 people applied for shares in the retail offer. Given the sheer volume of applications it is inevitable that some difficulties may arise in a certain proportion of individual cases. I understand that the number of applicants who did not receive their shares for some time after 14 July was about 0.5% of the total number of applicants. Where difficulties arose, my Department endeavoured to do everything possible to assist the applicants involved within the terms of the retail offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> Procedures are in place for applicants who feel they have been unfairly treated during the retail offer process.

      <P>Following the Government decision on 27 May last that the post office network should be further developed as a one-stop-shop through the provision of an enhanced range of facilities in post offices, I established an interdepartmental working group, representative of the Department of the Taoiseach together with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and of my own Department, to explore all possibilities in this regard with a view to speedy implementation of initiatives wherever feasible. Possibilities being examined by the group include,<i> inter alia, </i>the payment of ESB bills, motor taxation renewal demands and publicly-available Internet access.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of advanced telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Recognising that in certain regions of the country competition alone will not provide the required advanced telecommunications infrastructural investment, I engaged a consortium of consultants led by Norcontel (Ireland) Limited to manage three calls for projects supporting the development of advanced telecommunications networks and services which might be co-funded by INTERREG and European Regional Development Fund European Union funding.</P>
      <P>The nine successful projects from the first and second calls were announced on 5 July 1999, details of which are set out in the following tabular statement. These entail 23 million euros of EU moneys leveraging a further 32 million euros of private sector investment. This investment will result in the provision of advanced telecommunications infrastructure to over 120 towns in 21 counties around the country.</P>
      <P>The third call for proposals closed on 16 August 1999 and four projects seeking 3.6 million euros of EU co-funding have been approved subject to contract. It is intended to announce the result of this call shortly. All of these projects are to be completed by 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>No proposals were received for certain parts of the Border, midlands, mid east and south east regions.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 40, 57, 58, 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months, I have met and consulted with delegations of the staff of the airports, the Aer Rianta union group, the relevant chambers of commerce and other interested parties to hear their concerns and views regarding  the ownership of the airports. This process of consultation was completed this morning when the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport discussed the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance and I have appointed Warburg Dillon Read-AIB to examine and evaluate the full range of recommendations made to me by the board of Aer Rianta in respect of the company's future <Col N="193" /> strategic direction. It is expected that the consultants will complete their work shortly. Following the receipt of their report and consideration of their recommendations, and after consultation in the normal manner with my fellow Ministers, I intend to bring specific proposals to Government in respect of the future strategic development of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>No decision on possible alternative ownership arrangements for any of the three State airports shall be taken in advance of that. I have not had any discussions with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in the matter.</P>
    <P>With particular reference to the Deputy's question on Shannon Airport, I have received no proposals for its privatisation and I assure the Deputy that it is not my intention to propose any change in relation to the airport's transatlantic traffic status.</P>
    <P>In any event, if at some future date, a Government decision were taken to offer ownership of any of the State airports to the private sector, that would, of necessity, involve a public tendering procedure open to all interested parties.</P>

      <P>Performance measurement will be an essential part of the public service contracts that are currently being negotiated with the CIE companies. Under the terms of the proposed contracts my Department will be provided on a regular basis with certain performance information which should demonstrate progress being made in relation to service levels and service standards in the bus and rail services. All performance measurement information provided under the contracts will be published. In addition, it is also envisaged that customer satisfaction surveys will be part of the contractual regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand CIE operating companies have also been working for some time on customer service improvements and have set themselves certain targets. Each company has gone through an extensive process of consultation, externally with their customers and internally with their own staff, and have now prepared individual customer charters. The charters for Iarnród Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath have been published and the Bus Éireann charter is expected later this month. The Iarnród Éireann charter includes provision for refunds where service standards fall below speci<Col N="194" /> fied levels. I am informed that the standards set in the charters will be measured internally on a regular basis and independently monitored twice a year. The results will be made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by commuters at the stations in question and elsewhere on the network. While Iarnród Éireann has taken some steps to increase capacity by increasing the amount of standing room available, the remedy lies in additional rolling stock and longer trains.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, 26 additional carriages are already on order and the first ten are expected to be delivered this month. There will then be a two month period while the rolling stock is tested and commissioned before entry into service. While this must be frustrating for commuters, it is an unavoidable step in ensuring that the carriages function to specification and that their subsequent operation meet safety criteria. The remaining 16 carriages are due to be delivered this time next year.</P>
      <P>The DTO Blueprint 2000-2006 recommends the phased purchase of a further 46 carriages together with platform extensions. These measures would enable the operation of eight car DART trains in place of the existing six car or four car trains. The DTO recommendations are currently being considered as part of the preparatory work for the national development plan.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent review of the International Energy Agency is a valuable independent critical assessment of our overall current energy policy. General lessons can be learned from reviews of this nature and although the recommendations and findings of such reviews <Col N="195" /> are not legally binding they nevertheless provide us with a valuable yardstick against which we can assess our own strategy for the evolving energy sector.</P>
      <P>Peat has traditionally been used as part of Ireland's mixed fuel policy pursued in the interest of security of supply. Indeed, peat was for many years Ireland's only indigenous fuel. The future of the peat plants operated by the ESB was considered in the 1995 report of the peat review group. That report laid out a programme of phased closure for the older less efficient peat-burning units together with a programme of refurbishment for other units as well as recommending the construction of a new 120 mega watt peat plant to be located in the east midlands.</P>
      <P>The refurbishment programme for the existing stations coupled with the commissioning of the new 120 mega watt station represents a long-term strategic approach to ensure the continued use of peat in electricity generation. It also maximises long-term employment in peat production and electricity generation in the midlands.</P>
      <P>In 1995 my predecessor signed a memorandum of understanding with the EU Commission on the provision of EU financial support for the new 120 mega watt peat plant currently under construction near Edenderry. One of the conditions of this agreement was the achievement of a reduction in carbon dioxide levels here through a programme of rehabilitation of cutaway bog and a programme of phased closure of the oldest and least efficient generation sets and selective refurbishment, with the latest technology, of some of the less old units. There is flexibility within this framework as to the plants and generation units to be retired or refurbished. The commitments given in relation to peat stations are being complied with and some of the oldest units are no longer operational.</P>
      <P>The operation of the existing peat plants is the responsibility of the ESB and plans or proposals that affect the future of these plants are a matter for the board of the ESB in the first instance, in consultation obviously with Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the electricity sector in Ireland is due to be liberalised from February 2000 next under the terms of the EU Electricity Directive. That directive allows a member state to make provision for the use of indigenous resources to meet up to 15 per cent of its annual electricity requirements. The future of peat fired power stations also falls to be considered in the context of the development of a liberalised electricity market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration is being given to the introduction of a scheme whereby peat fired stations may be given priority dispatch, in accordance with Article 8(4) of the EU Electricity Directive, by means of a public service obligation statutory instrument and the excess costs above the market price would be collected by means of a levy. As such a scheme would constitute state aid it would be necessary to have the approval of the EU <Col N="196" /> Commission prior to its introduction. My Department has asked the ESB for financial and other data to support a notification of state aid for approval.</P>

      <Quest>when a decision will be made on whether to construct a second gas pipeline to the United Kingdom; if this decision will be taken in conjunction with consideration of whether to construct a Dublin to Belfast gas pipeline; and if these issues will be decided prior or subsequent to the outcome of the exploration process of gas from the Corrib field.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>It clearly would be preferable to postpone a decision about the next increment of gas import infrastructure until the prospects for the Corrib field have been clarified. However, a prudent approach to security of supply dictates that the decision cannot be deferred indefinitely.</P>
      <P>In late 1997 my Department and BGE jointly commissioned a study of natural gas demand and related infrastructural requirements to the year 2025. The consultants examined a range of options and recommended the provision of a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector as the optimal solution on cost and other grounds. Since the study was launched there have been a number of developments including the possibility of a commercial gas find in the Corrib field, the interest shown by a consortium in the provision of a North-South interconnector and by other parties in the provision of additional gas pipelines both to and within Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department engaged economic consultants to undertake an economic evaluation of the various supply options proposed under the Gas 2025 study and the other possibilities which I mentioned. The consultants confirmed the findings of the Gas 2025 study that a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector, parallel to the existing interconnector, was the preferred choice. However, they recommended that a decision on future supply infrastructure should not be taken until the position regarding the prospect for the commercial development of the Corrib field is clear. There is a wealth of material about this issue on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>The primary initiative in relation to a new pipeline rests with BGE or any other player in the liberalised gas market.</P>

      <P>When airlines use sub contractors to provide ground handling services, it is the airlines' responsibility in the first instance to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service provider. In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation and it monitors the activities of airlines in this regard.</P>
      <P>Where the provision of ground handling services does not impinge on aircraft safety, such as catering supplies or aircraft cabin cleaning services, it is the responsibility of the existing agencies such as the regional health board's environmental health service for food safety, the Health and Safety Authority for safe work practices and the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the legal standards in the same manner as for any other industrial activity or service in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The general standards which airport authorities require ground handling companies to meet will be in addition to the regulatory requirements set out above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure work on the DART extension to Greystones, undertaken with the aid of EU funding, was completed earlier this year. Iarnród Éireann had planned to introduce a partial service in late summer. However, the introduction of this service has been delayed due to ongoing industrial relations issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court issued an interim recommendation urging the unions to lift an embargo on the training of newly recruited drivers and the testing of the line while the court was considering the substantive issues. Subsequently the Labour Court issued its final recommendation on 3 August and this proposed an £8,000 <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum payment to serving DART drivers in full and final settlement of all issues before the court. Neither recommendation was accepted by the drivers. Subsequent discussions between unions and management have not managed to find a solution and claims have since been put <Col N="199" /> forward on behalf of other groups in Íarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>Until the industrial relations issues have been resolved it will not be possible to give an estimated start-up date for the Greystones DART service. However, Iarnród Éireann has informed me that once the current dispute is settled it will take approximately six weeks to test the line before introducing a partial service.</P>
    <P>All the infrastructural works on the Malahide extension will be completed by the end of this year. It is expected that partial services on the Malahide line could commence in summer 2000. Full services on the extended line should be available early in 2001 after the delivery of the additional rolling stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Ryanair's proposal of recent months to open ten new routes to European destinations, five of which would be from Shannon, is coupled with a Ryanair request that it be allowed to invest £12 million in facilities at Dublin Airport and obtain in return a low cost charging arrangement of £1 per departing passenger for 20 years.</P>
      <P>I would of course welcome a return by Ryanair to Shannon Airport, but I am not in favour of the provision of services out of Shannon being linked to the level of airport charges obtaining at Dublin Airport. I also believe that, as a general principle, any proposal for airline or other private funding of terminal facilities at Dublin Airport, even if it were structured on an equitable commercial basis between Aer Rianta and the airline concerned, could not be permitted exclusively for one airline. An opportunity to conclude such a deal with Aer Rianta, or alternatively to get from Aer Rianta airport charges arrangements of equivalent effect, would have to be offered to all airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of an independent regulator is the best way of dealing with the economic regulation of Irish airports and, in particular, airport <Col N="200" /> charges. To that end, I secured Government approval last July for the drafting of legislation to establish a regulator and that process is now well under way. I therefore believe that the next regulatory decision in relation to any revised airport charges regime should be taken by the Regulator as early as possible next year, rather than by me.</P>
    <P>Those are my personal views on the Ryanair proposal and related matters. Cabinet colleagues, of course, may have their own views and it may be that completion and presentation to the Government of the Warburg Dillon Read consultancy report on the strategic future of Aer Rianta over the next few weeks or my own considered recommendations to Government in due course arising from that report, could afford opportunities for the Government to consider any of these issues.</P>

      <P>The provision of rail services is a matter for CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>CIE is being provided with very substantial resources for the maintenance and renewal of the railway infrastructure and the operation of railway services. The State subvention for the railway in 1999 is £89 million. Substantial funding for railway renewal has been provided under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99, assisted by EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and from this year by the Exchequer. Earlier this year the Government approved the implementation of a £430 million Railway Safety Programme for the years 1999-03. Further non-safety related investment for the period 2000-06 is being considered as part of the preparation of the forthcoming national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Dublin to Waterford line is benefiting significantly from this investment. The railtrack from Dublin to Kilkenny has largely been renewed with continuous welded rail, with the assistance of Cohesion and Structural Funds. Additional EU and Exchequer resources were provided as part of the LUAS light rail project reallocation to complete this work. Renewal of the section from Kilkenny to Waterford will be completed under the railway safety programme by 2003. It is hoped to have the signalling on the line converted to the centralised traffic control system by the end of next year. While very good progress is being made in improving the railways, both CIÉ and myself are in agreement that these improvements need to be continuously built on so that the best possible rail service can be provided for the travelling public.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for ensuring the safety of railway operations rests with Iarnród Éireann. Accordingly, it is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officer has been in contact again recently with Iarnród Éireann drawing their attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. To meet the increased capacity demands on this and other suburban lines, EU and Exchequer funding is being provided to purchase 20 diesel rail carriages at a total cost of £20 million. Of these, 12 are for use on the Maynooth line. In addition the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth, the re-signalling of the line and the lengthening of the <Col N="202" /> station platforms will facilitate additional train services and increase the passenger carrying capacity of the line.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, she is taking to prevent electricity rationing this winter due to demand exceeding supply; and if extra generating capacity by either or both ESB and new independent power procurers will be expedited.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by ESB that there is sufficient capacity to meet our winter electricity needs. ESB currently has responsibility for ensuring electricity demand is met. The company has approximately 4,325 mega watts of installed capacity, which will rise to 4,485 mega watts when the final phase of the Poolbeg plant comes into operation at the end of this year. This compares with the expected winter peak electricity demand of 3,700 mega watts.</P>
      <P>Continuing growth in the economy has led to an unprecedented demand for electricity. This increase in demand means that new generation capacity, beyond that which is already under construction, will be required by 2001. While there are projects in the pipeline by ESB and others for the provision of this capacity, the ESB is successfully managing the increased demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent media reports about a capacity shortfall. It is important to understand what is meant by the term &ldquo;capacity shortfall&rdquo;. It does not necessarily mean that ESB has insufficient capacity to meet the demand for electricity. All utilities, including ESB, must have reserve generating plant capacity available to meet demand above the anticipated peak demand. Capacity shortfall in this case means a tightening of the reserve operating margin that a prudent electricity operator would consider necessary.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 26 October 1999, it is important, not only for the introduction of competition in the electricity industry, but also for the economy's growing needs, that new electricity generating capacity is brought on stream at an early date. Until the planning processes are completed, no further movement can take place regarding the construction of new plant. A further issue is the allocation of gas pipeline capacity. My Department has recently issued a consultation document in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them. It is the established policy of Iarnród Éireann that all new trains and stations, together with major refurbishment projects at existing stations, should take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers.</P>
      <P>DART and new suburban rail rolling stock is accessible. Significant resources are being devoted to the provision of ramps, lifts, tactile surfaces, etc.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1999 it is expected that Dublin Bus will have approximately 33 accessible buses in operation. From 2000 all new buses purchased by Dublin Bus will be low floor and fully accessible.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann currently has 21 accessible buses in operation with a further 20 on order. It is Bus Éireann's intention to purchase low floor accessible large capacity single deck buses when replacing its urban fleet.</P>
      <P>CIE companies currently have the following arrangements in place to assist mobility impaired customers. Iarnród Éireann has established a disability users group which comprises regular rail users and members of the Irish Wheelchair Association, all of whom have a mobility impairment; has appointed a mobility impaired liaison officer, who co-ordinates the implementation of policy as well as offering assistance to both individuals and groups travelling, and offers assistance on the design of stations and rolling stock; and has a guide for mobility impaired customers which gives information on accessible facilities in stations and a guide for Iarnród Éireann staff on how to assist customers who have a mobility impairment &ndash; the latter has been posted out to each individual member of staff. Both guides were written with the assistance of the disability users group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> Dublin Bus has established a three person group, headed by the business development manager, to deal with accessibility issues. A people with disability Dublin Bus consultative group has also been established which includes representatives of a broad range of accessibility interests. Bus Éireann has established a consultative group for people with disabilities, which is comprised of representatives of a number of local networks of the Irish Council for People with Disabilities, and senior Bus Éireann management. Since 1990 all new coaches purchased by the company have been specified with a kneeling facility which allows the front of the coach to be lowered to allow for easier access. Developments in relation to coach design and manufacture which would improve Bus Éireann's capacity to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments will continue to be monitored.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming National Development Plan will include significant provisions in relation to the accessibility of public transport, including the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee to advise me on the accessibility of public transport for mobility impaired and disabled people.</P>
    <P>Accessible taxis are a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, while overall policy in relation to people with disabilities is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The millennium recognition awards, which were advertised at the end of May of this year with a closing date of 9 July, were administered on behalf of the national millennium committee by Area Development Management Limited and had a total allocation of £2 million. The awards attracted a huge response with nearly 1,400 applications made. Despite the large number of applications, the assessment process was done speedily and recommendations on 106 projects for the awards were made to the national millennium committee by mid-October. The awards were duly announced over last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The millennium events awards, with a total allocation of £3 million, were launched in mid-<Col N="208" /> September and the closing date for applications was 22 October. This initiative is being administered by local authorities and I expect that their recommendations will be submitted to the national millennium committee for consideration shortly.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the overall aim of the national millennium committee is to create a programme of projects and events over the period 1999 and 2000 and that this is reflected in both awards initiatives.</P>

      <P>In July 1997 our Department developed a year 2000 plan which identified all of the IT hardware and software in operation within the Department and identified the action necessary to ensure that they are year 2000 compliant. An internal monitoring committee was set up with the remit of overseeing progress on the implementation of the year 2000 compliance plan for the Department and for the agencies that come within the Department's remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 2000 compliance plan for the Department has been fully implemented and all necessary remedial action has been carried out. I am satisfied that our Department is fully prepared to <Col N="209" /> meet any of the issues raised by the millennium bug.</P>
    <P>The agencies that come within the remit of our Department which have already declared themselves year 2000 compliant are: FÁS, Forfás, the Health and Safety Authority, NET and the Crafts Council of Ireland. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the National Standards Authority of Ireland have completed remedial work on their business critical systems. Remedial work on their non-critical systems is almost complete and these agencies expect to have this work finalised by end of November 1999. The Department will continue to monitor closely developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>Additionally, on foot of a Government decision, this Department and its agencies have drawn up business continuity and staff cover plans for the millennium changeover period. The objective of these plans is to ensure continuity of critical business processes during and after the millennium changeover period. They describe how each organisation intends to respond to events which may disrupt normal operations by providing a road map of predetermined actions which will enable resumption of an acceptable level of service at the earliest possible time. The plans are under continuous review in order to keep them abreast of the changing business requirements of the relevant organisations.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): My Department began work on the year 2000 compliance programme in 1998. At this point the programme is complete and I am confident that all systems are compliant. A contingency plan for all critical business over the millennium period has also been finalised.</P>
    <P>The Department's compliance programme deals with three main areas &ndash; those which are of fatal, critical and marginal business impact. Projects of fatal or critical business impact for the Department include the Irish Marine Emergency Service, the forest service grant system, exploration licensing system and the financial management system. The Department has achieved year 2000 compliance in all areas affecting the core business. Monitoring and updating of systems and equipment will continue until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>My Department oversees the work of 14 State agencies, nine port companies and 18 harbour authorities. All the bodies, where there is an exposure to the millennium bug, have Y2K compliance programmes in place. In addition I have personally reiterated to the chairperson of each agency the priority attached to year 2000 compliance and the requirement for contingency planning in particular. While I have received assurances from many of the key agencies, I intend to confirm with all the bodies that full compliance is being achieved and that business contingency plans are put in place.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, based on knowledge of the core business of the Department and its agencies, that every effort is being made to minimise year 2000 risks in key areas.</P>

      <P>The EU code of conduct on arms exports, adopted in June 1998, is a major step forward in gaining international recognition for arms restraint.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the code, EU states have agreed to examine all requests for licences to export military goods against a set of eight criteria, including the human rights record of the recipient state, the impact on regional stability and on the internal situation of the recipient state of any proposed sale, the attitude of the recipient state towards international arms control agreements and its attitude towards the international community, in particular in relation to terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code provides for an annual review to ensure its effective implementation. The first such review has just been completed, and the resulting document has been published in the EU Official Journal. This document outlines the measures taken to date to improve the code's implementation and the priorities for future action. In <Col N="212" /> addition, I have arranged for the Irish contribution to the review process to be made publicly available, through the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The EU has made presentations on the code to outside countries, and many of those &ndash; including the central and eastern European applicant states, Norway and Canada &ndash; have agreed to use the code in their licence considerations. The US has also agreed on the importance of the eight criteria in its considerations.</P>
    <P>In January of this year, the German Presidency of the EU proposed an alteration in the format of the code which would have made it legally binding on EU member states. Although it was not possible to achieve this goal, Ireland gave the proposal its full support, and has maintained its position in favour of a continual review and strengthening of the code.</P>

      <P>The latest available figures are for a passenger throughput at Dublin Airport of approximately 10 million to end September 1999. The estimated figure for the whole of 1999 is 13 million. The 1998 joint Aer Rianta-CIE air-rail link study reported that passenger throughput represented one-third of all surface trips to-from the airport. On this basis the total number of trips, including passengers, meeters and greeters and staff working at the airport, will be about 40 million this year. A number of options for a rail link are currently under consideration. In May 1998 the Government approved the extension of the light rail system to Dublin Airport. Public consultation on this line is ongoing and a number of options on how to serve the airport are under consideration. The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area recommended additional study of a heavy rail link to the airport and identified a number of options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE, on my instructions, has commissioned a consultancy team to undertake a strategic review of the Dublin suburban rail network in the longer term.

The possible development of a rail <Col N="214" /> link to Dublin Airport is being included in that evaluation. I expect to receive the final report before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>My Department is in the process of establishing a working group which will oversee the development of a short-term transport management strategy for the airport zone. This strategy will identify public transport and traffic management measures to be taken in the period up to the implementation of the rail infrastructure projects. This group will include all relevant Government departments, local authorities and agencies involved in the provision and facilitation of surface access links to Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>I understand from inquiries made by my Department with the French authorities that no instruction of the kind referred to in the Deputy's question was issued by the French Government to COGEMA. However, I understand that the French authorities are in the course of organising a public inquiry dealing with the COGEMA reprocessing activities at La Hague. I gather that this inquiry is to be carried out before the end of this year and is aimed at providing an opportunity for discussion of the impact of radioactive discharges from La Hague.</P>
      <P>At last year's ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission, the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention adopted a strategy on the marine discharge of radioactive substances. The strategy has as its objective the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges to the maritime area of the north-east Atlantic by the year 2020.</P>
      <P>The strategy requires the contracting parties to the convention, which include France and the UK, to work towards achieving substantial reductions or elimination of radioactive discharges by the year 2000. To this end, it was decided at a meeting of the OSPAR radioactive substance group last January that each contracting party would submit a national report setting out how they intend to implement the strategy and their timetable for implementation. These national reports will form the basis for the preparation of an overall report to be considered ultimately at the meeting of the OSPAR Commission in June 2000. Ireland will be directly involved in this process and will be doing everything possible to ensure that the objectives of the OSPAR strategy are fully achieved within the timeframe laid down.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the level of increasing car ownership and my Department is working in liaison with the Dublin Transportation Office in planning to meet the city's transport needs. The <Col N="216" /> Government is committed to implementing the necessary measures.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has reported that car ownership in 1997 was 317 per 1000 population, outstripping the original DTI forecast of 288 for the year 2001. It is acknowledged that car ownership rates are steadily pushing towards the European average of 450 per 1000 population. The DTO short-term action plan, published in September 1998, recommended a number of measures to address the faster than projected growth in traffic and slower than anticipated implementation of key elements of the Dublin transportation initiative. I immediately responded to this plan by approving a total investment of over £80 million in buses and suburban rail. These measures form part of an overall package designed to increase peak hour capacity by 37,000 trips.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering the detailed public transport investment proposals proposed by the Dublin Transportation Office in its Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-06, as well as proposals from the CIE companies, as part of the preparatory work for the national development plan. I expect that the plan will set out a comprehensive strategy and investment programme for public transport in the years 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of physical work has been undertaken on the Maynooth to Clonsilla line during 1999, concentrating on site preparation including the slewing of the existing track, laying of ballast, drainage and the lowering of tracks at bridges. Some platforms on the Maynooth to Dublin line have been lengthened and the remainder will be finished in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Almost eight miles of new track will be laid during 2000. Iarnród Éireann plans to have the whole infrastructure project completed on schedule by the end of 2000. New rolling stock for use on the service is also expected to be delivered by late 2000.</P>
      <P>The Dublin to Maynooth project will involve investment of approximately £35 million, including about £12 million for new rolling stock. In addition, funding of £3 million has been allocated to improve track and signalling to Mullingar and this work is also progressing satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>When this work has been completed it will be possible to introduce improved and more frequent services. It will not however, be possible for Iarnród Éireann to increase the number of services in the interim.</P>
      <P>Approximately £3 million has been spent on the infrastructural element of the Dublin to Maynooth project to date.</P>

      <P>I have said on several occasions that questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis in the context of developments in their main business areas.</P>
      <P>The Government has mandated myself and the Minister for Finance to initiate a process with the board of Aer Lingus and appropriate social partners to address the funding requirements of Aer Lingus and possible sources of such funding including an initial public offering. The process is under way and I will be submitting proposals to Government in due course.</P>
      <P>With regard to Aer Rianta, the report submitted by that company on the future strategic direction of the Aer Rianta group as a whole, sought, <i>inter alia,</i> authorisation to prepare for an IPO. Advisers were appointed jointly by the Minister for Finance and myself to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report and to evaluate the full range of recommendations made by the board of Aer Rianta to me.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the advisers' report in the next week or so. Following that and in the light of consideration of their recommendations, I will bring specific recommendations to Government.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment on what the outcome of these processes might be prior to their completion.</P>
      <P>In some other instances, the boards of the companies are considering broad strategies for their futures in liberalised markets. I expect that possible ownership change would be on the agenda in any such review. I await the results with considerable interest.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, as part of a Government decision of 23 February 1999 to approve an investment programme by the INPC to upgrade the Whitegate refinery, INPC were requested to actively pursue and report on the scope for other commercial opportunities to underpin the refining operation, including possible joint ventures or a strategic partnership in activities ancillary to, or having a synergy with, the refining business.</P>
      <P>INPC are currently examining a number of possibilities for the business development of the company. I am prepared to consider these, including the possibility of the sale of equity in the company if a suitable partner can be found that advances INPC's overall aims especially the security of supply objective.</P>
      <P>Changes in the postal sector across Europe and beyond require An Post to look at forming a strategic alliance with a suitable postal operator. This issue will be addressed in the near future by Government.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 15 July 1998 to offer six military barracks for sale. The barracks selected for closure and disposal were: Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy; Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig; Devoy Barracks, Naas; Magee Barracks, Kildare; Clancy Barracks, Dublin and Castleblayney Military Barracks.</P>
      <P>With the exception of Clancy Barracks, which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been evacuated.</P>
      <P>I have decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
      <P>Following a tender competition for the appointment of independent consultants to draw up an integrated action area plan for Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, consultants were appointed on 23 August 1999. The consultants appointed were required to liaise with the local authority and all other interested parties with regard to the formulation of the plan. In this connection the National Building Agency made a submission which will be considered in the context of the future of the lands at Ballincollig. That plan is due for completion by 23 November 1999, and the property will be disposed of following evaluation of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for <Col N="221" /> Naas UDC which was adopted on 29 May 1999 and this property will be offered for sale in the near future. A tender competition for the appointment of selling agents was advertised recently.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently, Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, tenders from independent consultants are under consideration for the preparation of an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North-Eastern Health Board for use as a high support child care residential unit. The legal and financial formalities have yet to be finalised. In the meantime, I propose to allow the North-Eastern Health Board occupy the property under a caretaker agreement.</P>
    <P>As part of an ongoing review of the Department's properties and bearing in mind the continuing pressure on land resources in major cities and towns, I have decided that as a contribution to alleviating the shortage of land for housing the following properties adjoining barracks should be disposed of: Susan's Field, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, six acres; Old Married Quarters, adjoining Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, two and a half acres and Mellowes Field, adjoining Renmore Barracks, Galway, ten acres.</P>
    <P>In addition, an area of one and a half acres of the barracks in Waterford city, which is used by the FCA, is to be sold.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is constant pressure on the relevant authorities with regard to suitable land for housing and it is considered that the sale of these prime properties in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will go some way towards relieving that pressure.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance, my Department completed a year 2000 preliminary impact assessment report in 1997. In August 1997 a year 2000 project board was set up, chaired by an assistant secretary, to oversee the work on <Col N="222" /> year 2000 compliance. As part of the preliminary impact assessment, a number of departmental systems were identified as being non-compliant. Resulting from this, a year 2000 compliance plan was drafted in October 1997. The year 2000 project board meets on a monthly basis to review and monitor progress and reports regularly to the Department's management committee and IT steering committee. In addition, every two months a status report is forwarded to the Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committee.</P>
      <P>Remedial work was carried out on all non-compliant systems in the Department. All business critical systems were year 2000 compliant by the Government deadline of end July 1999. Full compliance was achieved on all other marginal systems by the end of September 1999.</P>
      <P>With regard to State bodies, the position is that on foot of a Government decision, a monitoring committee, chaired at assistant secretary level, was established in my Department in June 1998 to oversee year 2000 compliance in the relevant State agencies. All of the agencies have been reporting year 2000 progress every two months and all are now fully compliant.</P>

      <P>Commonage framework plans set down the agri-environmental requirements for each commonage to avoid overgrazing and for the regeneration of degraded areas. To be eligible for livestock premia-headage farmers with commonage land will have to farm in accordance with an agri-environmental plan under the REP scheme or under the national scheme to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The number of animals stipulated in the agri-environmental plan will be the maximum number on which premia-headage will be paid.</P>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, payment of a pension can be authorised only from the date of receipt of a valid application. The date of receipt of a valid application is the date on which all core documentation is lodged with the local FDS office.</P>
      <P>In this case, the application for the person named was lodged in the local FDS office on 23 February 1999. On examination of the file a number of queries arose. The applicant was requested to provide further details and the requested information was sent back 33 days later. Accordingly, the date of valid application was deemed to be 28 March 1999, 33 days after the application was lodged.</P>
      <P>The applicant lost no payment in respect of the time that the initial application was being examined in my Department. Payment was deferred only in respect of the delay in furnishing a valid application. In the circumstances, there are no grounds for backdating the payment of the pension to the original date of application.</P>
      <P>My Department has no record of unanswered correspondence relating to this case.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply of 12 October 1999, this applicant changed his area declared under the 1999 area aid scheme from that which had been claimed in 1998. The changes outlined by the farmer on his map have now been entered on the Department's electronic database. Following this a dual claim has been determined on one of the land parcels claimed by the person named. Both herdowners involved have been written to in this connection. No payments can issue until this matter is resolved.</P>

      <P>The applicant submitted 18.04 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 16.83 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 1.21 hectares or 7.19 per cent between the area claimed and that determined. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied. Therefore the penalty applied is 2.42 hectares, leaving the area determined at 14.41 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As can be seen from the following table, my Department is now year 2000 compliant, as are all but one of the offices under its remit  &ndash;  the Houses of the Oireachtas  &ndash;  where all business critical projects are compliant, but one remaining marginal impact project is being finalised. All Departments and offices continue to monitor the year 2000 situation and all but two have formal independently audited contingency plans, aimed at ensuring a smooth transition over the crucial end-of-year period. The two remaining offices are finalising their plans this month.</P>

      <P>In general, bodies such as hospitals, educational facilities, charities and other bodies which provide services in respect of the physical and other disabilities are exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the bodies involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by registered businesses.</P>
      <P>However it is possible under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order, 1981 for individuals to obtain repayments of VAT expended on certain aids and appliances which assist persons with a disability overcome that disability. For example, walk-in baths, lifting seats and chairs, hoists and lifters and stair lifts, designed for persons with a disability, as well as iron lungs and kidney machines, can qualify for relief.</P>
      <P>Under the disabled drivers and passengers tax concession scheme, a qualifying driver or passenger can avail of vehicle registration tax, excise and VAT relief, subject to certain conditions, in respect of the purchase and operation of a motor vehicle. In certain circumstances, this relief is also available to organisations catering for the disabled.</P>

      <P>Preliminary tax is an estimate of a self-employed individual's net income tax liability, for the year of assessment. The minimum amount of tax which must be paid to avoid a charge to interest is the lower of: 90 per cent of the final liability to tax for the actual year of assessment; 100 per cent of the final liability to tax for the previous year of assessment; and 105 per cent of the final liability to tax for the pre-preceding year of assessment where preliminary tax is paid through the direct debit scheme.</P>
      <P>Where a married couple are jointly assessed the estimate is based on their joint incomes.</P>
      <P>Where there is income which has been subject to deduction of tax under the PAYE system this income must be included in the calculation. However, credit is given for the tax deducted under PAYE in this calculation. The net effect, is that preliminary tax is not calculated on PAYE income but on the other income.</P>

Three additional social workers have been recruited.</P>
      <P>The average waiting time for assessment in the region is currently estimated at two years approximately. This has been reducing. While the current number on the waiting list is 184, the board envisage greater reductions in the waiting list given the increase in the number of social workers in the service from 3.5 to 9.5 in the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>The matter the Deputy raises was dealt with by the Labour Court in its recommendation dated 27 October 1999 (LCR 16330) as follows:</P>
      <P>The proposed integration of pre-registration nursing education into the third level sector has raised many questions for this group. In LCR 16261 the court stated that pay and conditions for nurse teachers should be finalised by September 2000 when the Nursing Education Forum report will be available. The court recommended that in the meantime, this group should be paid 4 per cent from 1 July 1999, on account, to be subsumed into any pay increases negotiated after the forum report, clarifying their new roles, is available. The court further recommended that the option of a voluntary early retirement package should be provided in order to supplement the options proposed by the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of further submissions received from the Nursing Alliance, the court now <Col N="231" /> recommends that instead of receiving an interim payment of 4 per cent, nurse teachers should receive similar salary increases to those recommended for other management grades and that the same phasing arrangements should apply. The court makes this revised recommendation in recognition of the change in their role arising from the implementation of the commission's proposal, and on the basis that this will dispose of the pay issue.</P>
    <P>The court also calls on employers to engage in early discussions with nurse teachers to clarify matters of concern to this group in relation to their future conditions.</P>
    <P>This recommendation clarifies the pay issue and, assuming acceptance of this recommendation by nurses, the differentials issue for nurse teachers has been resolved. Individual employers will engage in discussions with nurse teachers regarding their options for the future as soon as practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, <Col N="232" /> and concerns about adverse effects other than dental fluorosis have not been substantiated.</P>
    <P>The 1991 survey of adult dental health found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. Since 1960 surveys on oral health have been carried out periodically by health boards to monitor changes in oral health.</P>
    <P>Unless an authoritative body in this country or internationally indicates that there appears to be an issue of public health relating to the use of fluoride which should be investigated and sets priorities for research further research would be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that where public water supplies are fluoridated at optimum level a small proportion of the population may be affected by a mild form of fluorosis, evident as diffuse white lines and patches, which is not aesthetically damaging or harmful in any respect and which usually cannot be seen by the untrained eye. The surveys carried out in this country show the prevalence of fluorosis in Irish school children to be not of any public health significance.</P>
    <P>A report dated October 1999 on water fluoridation and public health prepared by the faculty of public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is strongly supportive of the continuation of current water fluoridation policies.</P>

      <P>The Independent Living Movement is a worldwide movement originating in the USA in the 1960s. The Irish arm of the movement, the Centre for Independent Living, was established in Dublin in 1992 and I understand there are now 25 centres around the country. The CIL is a voluntary organisation dedicated to lobbying in relation to the rights of people with disabilities, with specific emphasis on personal assistance, housing, transport, access and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Government's policy in relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable them to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. Health services in the sector are being developed in line with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future. </i> The report sets out in detail the requirements for the maintenance and development of a range of services, including personal assistance services. Since this Government took office, a total of almost £37 <Col N="233" /> million by way of additional funding has been invested in the maintenance and development of services in the sector. This year a total of £13.4 million additional funding was provided of which £3 million (rising to £6 million on a full year cost basis in 2000) is for the development of services.</P>
    <P>In the context of the overall thrust of the development of services for people with disabilities in recent years, I would consider that the Centre for Independent Living plays a significant role in the physical and sensory disability sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 15 specified illnesses covered under the long-term illness scheme and the scheme has not been extended since 1975 having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Most recently, a new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit was introduced on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>Persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependents may be entitled to a medical card. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. In this regard, income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State to those with ongoing medical expenses such as people with osteoporosis.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse. The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension scheme are more flexible than those applying to the old age and retirement pensions. Widowed people can qualify by using either their own or their late spouse's social insurance record; in addition, a person may also use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension &ndash; £82.10 per week for those over 66 and under 80 years of age &ndash; is now 114 per cent of the main rate recommended by the commission on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> A widow's and widower's non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test. The maximum rate of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension &ndash; £78.50 for those over 66 and under 80 years of age &ndash; is 109 per cent of the commission's recommended rate. Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes where the person is over 66 years of age. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>The rate of the one parent family payment &ndash; £78.50 for those over 66 &ndash; has also reached 109 per cent of the recommended CSW rate. This payment is available to widowed people with children who do not qualify for a contributory widow(er)'s pension. It is available to both men and women who are parenting alone and is designed to, first, provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents and, second, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence. To this end, an earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
    <P>The question of future improvements in social welfare provisions for widows and widowers &ndash; as for all social welfare clients &ndash; is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes was published in August this year.</P>
      <P>As part of its work the group commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute &ndash; ESRI &ndash; to undertake research on a number of issues including the relationship of the qualified adult allowance &ndash; QAA &ndash; to the personal rate of payment in the social welfare code. At present the QAA is paid at approximately 60 per cent of the personal rate which is the level recommended by the commission on social welfare. Based on its research, the ESRI suggested that 70 per cent would be a more appropriate level. The estimated cost of increasing the QAA to the level suggested by the ESRI is £50 million per annum.</P>
      <P>In conducting its research the ESRI used a new approach to arrive at the level suggested for the QAA. This involved using non-monetary indicators derived from the Living in Ireland Survey 1994 to arrive at a suggested monetary value. Because of the novel nature of the approach some consider that the results cannot, as yet, be regarded as definitive. Nevertheless, the research makes a significant contribution to the debate about the relative living costs of different types of household and the research findings will be considered further in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>As in the case of all other <Col N="239" /> social assistance payments, disability allowance is subject to a means test. For the purposes of assessing means, account is taken of the claimant's own means and, in the case of a couple, the joint means are assessed. In this regard, recipients of disability allowance are treated in the same way as recipients of all other social assistance payments, e.g. unemployment assistance, old age non-contributory pensions, etc.</P>
      <P>In assessing the means of a claimant's spouse for disability allowance purposes, account is taken of the spouse's net earnings, that is earnings net of income tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation and union dues. A certain amount of the spouse's earnings from employment is disregarded &ndash; £45 where they are working four days or more, £30 where they are working between one and three days. In addition, an extra allowance may be made for reasonable travel expenses to work. Half of the spouse's net income is then assessed as means.</P>
      <P>Any relaxation of the means test along the lines suggested by the Deputy would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities. It would also raise equity issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> other recipients: it would be difficult to justify disregarding spouse's income in cases of disability allowance and not doing so in the case of other social assistance payments.</P>
      <P>On the wider question of individualising social welfare payments, this matter was recently examined by the working group on the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. Several options were considered by the group, and while no agreement was reached, it was noted that individualisation was taking place through the expansion of the social insurance system with increasing workforce participation by women and the extension of social insurance cover to part-time workers in the early 1990's.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the current social welfare system is a very complex and wide ranging system which provides a comprehensive range of services to those in our society who are in need of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to streamlining and simplifying the system my Department undertakes a wide range of reviews of the effectiveness of its various schemes. Such reviews are intended to ensure <Col N="240" /> that the social welfare schemes continue to operate effectively and fulfil their objectives in the light of current needs. Any consequential changes to social welfare legislation are normally incorporated in the annual Social Welfare Bill which implements the budget improvements in social welfare.</P>
    <P>For example, in 1998, I took the opportunity to correct a particular anomaly in the back to work area enterprise allowance scheme, formerly known as the area based allowance scheme. Under the former scheme people taking up self employment in areas covered by the area partnership companies could receive transitional support amounting to 100 per cent, 75 per cent, 50 per cent and 25 per cent of social welfare payments over a four year period. From January 1998 I extended the scheme to the entire country thus ensuring equal treatment for all social welfare applicants seeking to establish a self employment enterprise under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In 1999, I also took the opportunity to rectify a number of anomalies which had come to my attention. These relate to the payment of pensions to self employed persons who were over the age of 56 years when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988. I also introduced a new bereavement grant scheme to replace the old death grant scheme and extended the scope of the scheme to public service employees who pay a modified rate of PRSI contribution and to the self-employed. The 1999 Social Welfare Act also included provisions for the continued payment of disability allowance to existing recipients who go into hospital or institutional care and for changes in the arrangements whereby lone parents can retain their entitlements under the former schemes of deserted wife's benefit and assistance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>With regard to future plans to simplify the system, my Department will continue its series of reviews of its programme expenditure and in this context the scope for simplification within the various schemes will be examined in a systematic manner. The current programme of expenditure reviews for the year April 1999 to April 2000 in my Department is as follows: (1) free schemes (travel, electricity, TV licence, phone rental); (2) one parent family payment; (3) back to school clothing and footwear allowance; (4) urban and Gaeltacht school meals schemes; (5) illness and disability payment schemes; (6) supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA; (7) money advice and budgeting service &ndash; MABS and (8) community development programme &ndash; CDP.</P>
    <P>The first five of these are already under way. The SWA and MABS reviews will commence early in the new year and the CDP review will commence in mid year. A comprehensive review of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to old age (contributory) and retirement pensions is cur<Col N="241" /> rently being undertaken by an interdepartmental group chaired by my Department. Particular attention will be focused on the yearly average test. It will also deal with the treatment of pre-1953 contributions and the commitment in the Programme for Government to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pensions purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition a working group comprising officials of my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health and Children as well as representatives of the social partners are due to report to me shortly on the underlying issues affecting the participation of women in mainstream education, training and employment programmes.</P>

      <P>The restoration works on the Royal Canal in County Westmeath have included the reconstruction of Moran's Bridge, Mullingar, the replacement of lock gates at locks 18-38 inclusive, the dredging of approximately 29 miles of canal channel, the reconstruction of bog embankments and the removal of obstructions to navigation such as footbridges and pipe crossings. The restoration has also included ancillary works such as the provision of moorings and potable water. The costings for canal restoration works have not been recorded on a county basis.</P>
      <P>The works to be completed to re-open the Royal Canal to Clondra, County Longford include the replacement of six road bridges and two Bord na Móna crossings, the replacement of lock gates at locks 39-46 inclusive and the reconstruction of bog embankments. Additional sustainable water supplies will also have to be sourced to maintain the Royal Canal as a navigable system. The preliminary estimated cost of completing the restoration of the Royal Canal to Clondra is £10-£12 million and the timescale involved would be four to five years.</P>
      <P>I hope that the completion of the Royal Canal can be included in the National Development Plan. However, as the plan has not yet been finalised, I am not in a position to give a commitment in relation to this or any other project at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that both my Department and the associated offices and agencies under the aegis of my Department have a detailed programme of work in place to prepare for year 2000 compliance and that every effort is being made to ensure that compliance is achieved. Most systems have been made compliant at this stage with many agencies under the aegis of the Department having declared compliance. The critical areas which remain to be completed relate to the replacement of Garda mainframe systems with the new PULSE system and telecommunications upgrades-replacements in court offices. There are also a small number of marginal systems to be completed.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Garda authorities that the process of transferring data from existing Garda mainframe systems to PULSE, the new year 2000 compliant Garda computer system, has commenced and that, when completed, PULSE will be operationally ready by 15 November 1999. In relation to all other niche Garda computer systems, it is envisaged that these will also be year 2000 compliant within the above timeframe.</P>
      <P>Work is also well advanced in all other areas and is planned for completion by mid-November. In addition, work is at an advanced stage in relation to contingency planning in respect of business critical functions of the Department and its agencies.</P>

    <P>It can be seen from the above figures that there was a reduction in crime &ndash; coupled with an increase in the detection rate &ndash; in the period 1996 to 1998. Provisional statistics for the year to date also indicate a substantial reduction in crime in the area so far this year. I also understand that most of the recorded serious crime has been detected to date.</P>
    <P>According to the Garda authorities, over the past number of months every effort has been made to try and apprehend the main culprits involved in crime. This has been done by targeting the individuals in question and setting up special patrols in the city centre and in estates. These measures have proved effective with many of the key criminals presently in custody. The official marked Garda car allocated to Kilkenny Garda station is also utilised in patrolling the area.</P>
    <P>I have been further informed that the situation in relation to Kilkenny will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Kilkenny Garda station will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of the other Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Child Care was established in February 1999 and held 14 meetings in the course of its deliberations. The terms of reference of the committee were to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report of the Expert Working Group on Child Care, and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Report of the Commission on the Family and the Report of the National Forum on Early Childhood Education. Wide consultation on child care issues had already taken place in drawing up the three reports referred to and the interdepartmental committee supplemented this through consultation with various bodies on the delivery of the child care proposals outlined in these reports. My Department submitted the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Child Care to the Government on 14 September 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government has noted the report of the committee and has referred it for consideration to a ministerial group, which I am chairing.

This group has met on a number of occasions and aims to conclude its deliberations as soon as practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously outlined my response to the issues raised by the Union of Students in Ireland in the context of their 1999 pre-budget submission.</P>
      <P>The standardised charge for examinations, registration and student services was levied by the third level colleges levied in the context of the free fees initiative in the 1995-96 academic year. This charge is £278 for the current year and I would point out to the Deputy that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge. I believe that the effect of the charge has been to provide a sounder and more secure funding base for the services covered. I am concerned to ensure that the level of the services provided fully reflects the amount charged and my officials are in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities in this regard. I am also concerned that appropriate systems of consultation and accountability in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded apply in all third level colleges. I understand that the Higher Education Authority's review of the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level colleges in this regard, will be finalised shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of maintenance grants, my approach has been to follow the practice in recent years and increase the reckonable income limits <Col N="250" /> in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Similarly, in relation to the value of the grant, I have followed the practice of recent years and increased third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year. I have indicated previously, in relation to the student support schemes, that my priority is to remove anomalies in the schemes. In particular, I have honoured the commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post leaving certificate courses. A maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses was introduced with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    <P>I have also addressed the position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular, under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which he or she is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in this year's Finance Act, will encourage the provision of on and near campus accommodation. The provision of on-campus accommodation is on-going in the third level sector. On-campus accommodation for seven hundred students is expected to be completed well in advance of the next academic year at the Galway campus of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology while approval for on-campus accommodation in respect of 450 bed spaces has been sanctioned by the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been an increased intake by the colleges in the teacher education sector as a result of the growing needs in this area. Both of the colleges mentioned by the Deputy have submitted capital development plans which are being actively considered by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June this year I announced a major new stay in school initiative. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding will be granted to schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. The underlying objective of the initiative is to establish a direct link between schools experiencing serious retention problems and my Department with a view to agreeing multi-annual programmes of action with clear targets, which will be matched with appropriate resources. As I stated when announcing this initiative the core point is that schools themselves need to take charge of tackling early school leaving and I will give them the supports they need to make an impact. In this regard I should add that my Department has appointed two national co-ordinators to co-ordinate the initiative and assist participating schools to formulate their retention plans and targets.</P>
      <P>In inviting applications for the initial phase, priority will be given to schools and VEC schemes with retention rates appreciably below the national average. I expect that in the region of 50 schools will be invited to participate this year with that number being expanded in 2000 and subsequent years. Schools will be selected for invitation based on their retention rate and overall enrolment. My intention is to include as many pupils as possible who are at risk of early school leaving. Attention will be given to achieving a regional and sectoral spread when selecting the participating schools. When I announced the initiative I stated that efforts would be made to achieve a measure of regional coverage. To demonstrate this I stated my intention to include a number of schools in the Inishowen Peninsula in the first phase of the initiative, given the particular impact of the problem in that area and the desirability to provide a lead for isolated areas in testing approaches to target the problem. This remains my intention.</P>
      <P>My Department expects to be in a position to say which schools will be invited into the first phase of the initiative very shortly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the project mentioned in the Deputy's question I must point out that funding under the stay in school initiative will be paid directly to schools to enable them to implement their agreed multi-annual plans to retain their pupils to the end of the senior cycle. Funding will not be paid directly by my Department, under this initiative, to groups other than schools working with early school leavers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant to cover VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme whereas voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita </i>basis based upon enrolments.

      <P>This question concerns my Department's decision not to pay the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996.</P>
      <P>My Department's position in regard to the payment of these allowances is based on the advice of the Department of Finance regarding Government decisions taken over the years regarding public service pensions and on the facts regarding my Department's longstanding practice.</P>
      <P>A teacher's pay is made up of incremental salary and of a range of allowances. It is my Department's longstanding practice that the benefit of an increase in incremental salary will be reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and that the benefit of an allowance will be reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held that allowance in pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's practice in regard to allowances goes back to at least 1970, when post of responsibility allowances were introduced in the <Col N="255" /> case of vocational teachers. Following further discussions with teachers' unions and school management, they were introduced in the case of secondary teachers in 1971. Although the allowances were payable with retrospective effect, they were not payable to teachers who had retired prior to 1 July 1968, the agreed effective date of establishment of the allowances. The Department of Finance has confirmed that my Department's practice has not been affected by Government decisions made over the years, most recently in 1997, regarding the link between public service pay and pensions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> It was agreed under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work that the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances would be payable to teachers with effect from 1 September 1996. In accordance with longstanding practice, the revised scales of the allowances are not payable to teachers who retired prior to that date.</P>
    <P>I should add that the allowances in question are related to the numbers of teachers employed in the school and that the scale of the allowances held at retirement continues to be reckoned in the pension irrespective of whether the numbers fall or rise after retirement.</P>
