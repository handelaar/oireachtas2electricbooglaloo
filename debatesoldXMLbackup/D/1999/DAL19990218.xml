      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies John Bruton, Quinn and Gormley. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I call on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matters of urgent public importance: the admission by a Government source today that money has been accepted by Fianna Fáil from a passports for investment investor; the allegation that the then treasurer of Fianna Fáil, now Taoiseach, was aware of this and the claim that an offer of immunity to someone willing to testify to the Flood tribunal on these matters was withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31, I request the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following: the allegations made in a newspaper article that a sum of around £10,000 was diverted from the account of a passport investor to a Fianna Fáil controlled account in another financial institution in 1993 at a time when the Taoiseach was treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Party and the need for the Taoiseach to make a full statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I request that the business of the House be suspended to allow time for a debate on the revelations that a transfer of £10,000 from an ICC account of a passport investor to a Fianna Fáil account in another institution took place in 1993 while the Taoiseach was treasurer of the party.</P>

      <P>I am glad you have decided to make this decision. Unfortunately, I cannot take the motion earlier as I have a civic reception in Wexford but I will come back to take it. It is important for me to say I have no power over immunities for people at the tribunal. A request was not made to me to give anyone immunity. I have no knowledge of a request for immunity. Nobody raised anything about immunities for the former Deputy, Ray Burke. The accusation that I had anything to do with an immunity relating to Ray Burke&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of whole new sections of the Finance Bill being introduced on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach said he would take it up with the Minister for Finance. Last night the Minister for Finance was not available to reply to the Second Stage debate as he was in Florida. How do the amendments stand now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the Immigration Bill currently before the House retrospectively validates orders made under the 1935 Aliens Act. Two orders under that Act have been laid before the House this week. Have they been approved by Government, because they seem to run coun<Col N="1268" /> ter to the High Court judgment in the Laurentiu case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a detailed question for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether they have been approved by the Government. In essence, they further restrict the criteria for entry of certain designated non-nationals into the State who require transit visas to avoid being automatically refused admission at the ports. Has this been approved by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My problem is that, while the legislation has not been passed by the Oireachtas, it purports to validate orders that are now being made. It strikes me that the correct course of action would be to wait until the opinion of the Oireachtas on the legislation is determined before secondary legislation is introduced under the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the legislation governing Telecom Éireann to facilitate an initial public offering of shares in the company and to make legislation pertaining to the company compatible with its subsequent status as a publicly quoted company. Before outlining the <Col N="1274" /> provisions of the Bill, I would like to provide some background to the present position in order that the significance of these proposals may be fully appreciated.</P>
    <P>For millennia, human communication could only go as fast as the fleetest runner, the swiftest horse or the fastest ship. As we approach the new millennium, we can now send messages to each other literally at the speed of light along fibre optic cables or via radio signals which can be relayed around the planet in a matter of moments by satellite.</P>
    <P>Developments in telecommunications in the past 160 years have been truly amazing. The telegraph system, developed in the 1830s, was introduced to Ireland in the 1850s. The first services were established by private companies such as the private railway companies. In 1869, however, as the magnitude of linking the whole country to the telegraph system became apparent, the Government stepped in and nationalised the telegraphs system. Through the office of The Postmaster General, and later through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of the Irish State, the State retained control of this essential means of communication.</P>
    <P>The first major change took place in 1984 when, almost at the dawn of the new information age, Telecom Éireann was established as a State-owned company to take over the running of the telecommunications system. The company has since established a world class communications infrastructure and service in Ireland. Some 150 years after the development of the first telegraph companies in Ireland, I am happy to present this Bill aimed at facilitating the proposed initial public offering of the State's shares in the company.</P>
    <P>Government strategy in regard to the telecommunications sector over recent years has been focused very much on the introduction of strong and effective competition in the marketplace. One of the main planks of this strategy has been the introduction of an equitable and transparent regulatory regime. This has been effected through the transposition of relevant EU Directives into law and the setting up of the independent office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. I pay tribute to the previous Government for setting up the office, the director of which, Ms Etain Doyle, has worked extraordinarily diligently.</P>
    <P>The development of Telecom Éireann commenced with a strategic alliance with Comsource, involving KPN of the Netherlands and Telia of Sweden, which initially entailed selling 20 per cent of the Government's shareholding in the company. The objective of this agreement was to provide a vital cash injection to the company which had, at that time, a substantial amount of debt to deal with &ndash; more than £1.2 billion &ndash; and to provide access to the expertise necessary for the company to deal with the impact of forth<Col N="1275" /> coming competition. The deal proved to be a turning point for the company. It made considerable progress in restructuring its costs and tariffs and in introducing substantial reductions in many of its charges to its customers over the past two years. More are expected over the coming year.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has also been able to make major strides technologically and is now capable of providing the full range of services to its customers, including the largescale multinational information and communication technology companies. The second part of the development process within Telecom Éireann entailed involving the workforce in the whole process of change within the company. The agreement of the employee share option plan between the company and the unions, which was my achievement, is now being finalised and involves the sale of 9.9 per cent of the company to the employees for £190 million with an additional 5 per cent being transferred to the employees. This is in return for an agreement on company transformation including specific measures relating to changes in work practices and staff numbers.</P>
    <P>In the past the most widespread organisational structure for telecommunications was an integrated State owned monopoly such as Telecom Éireann. The company operated solely in the home market and was given the task of providing essential services to the State where the provision of such services would not have been economically attractive to the private sector.</P>
    <P>Now new service providers have the technical and economic means to compete against the public telecommunications operator. The globalisation of businesses requires advanced international services and the growing demand for telecommunications services requires speedy responses to meet customer needs. The Government believes these needs are best met by a vibrant competitive and fully liberalised market in which Telecom Éireann will continue to play a major part.  As for the company, it no longer needs or wants the protection of the State and can only achieve its commercial mandate by being able to operate freely in pursuance of its own commercial strategic goals.</P>
    <P>Similar positions were taken in regard to and by former national telecommunications operators in other countries with liberalised markets and which see the need to operate in a fully commercial environment. There is an international trend evident with a number of high profile divestments of State shareholdings in companies such as France Telecom in France and Swisscom in Switzerland. However, it is very much because of the circumstances prevailing in Ireland that the Government agreed to conduct this initial public offering of shares in the company. It is not simply because we wish to follow blindly the current international trends.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed particular objectives for the initial public offering of shares in <Col N="1276" /> Telecom Éireann. These comprise maximising the proceeds to be returned to the Exchequer, ensuring a successful initial public offering, promoting wider share ownership and ensuring value for money on expenditure related to the sale.</P>
    <P>In terms of maximisation of the proceeds of the sale and subject to market volatility, the market trends for telecommunications shares are now quite favourable. They recovered well from fluctuations and investor uncertainty evident in world equity markets prior to last Christmas. While European telecommunications shares were not immune to this volatility, they consistently outperformed equity markets in general and each of the flotations I mentioned earlier were oversubscribed.</P>
    <P>The power of telecommunications shares to withstand even the most volatile of market environments was evident recently. Following the fall in the market as a result of the Brazilian devaluation, the merger between AirTouch of the United States and Vodafone from the UK, which created the world's largest mobile phone consortium, sparked tremendous activity in world markets. The amount of money due to the Exchequer from the proceeds of the sale cannot be stated with any degree of certainty. The decision as to what to do with the proceeds of the sale is ultimately for the Government to make.</P>
    <P>The question of the price has been and continues to be a major consideration in the offering of Telecom Éireann shares. I know my advisers are following the market trends closely so that we have the best advice available at the time when the price range needs to be set.</P>
    <P>Questions also arise as to what proportion of the shares will be divested in the IPO process and what proportion, if any, is to be retained by Government and for how long. As some of you no doubt will be aware, the net result of the strategic alliance and the employee share option deal has meant the Government's shareholding in the company will be reduced to 65.1 per cent. As part of the agreement with the strategic partners, KPN/Telia has the option of buying a further 15 per cent of the Government's shares. This option comes into effect later this year and, if they choose to exercise it, the amount of shares held by the State would come to 50.1 per cent. The purpose of this Bill, which has been approved by Government, is partly to allow for the reduction of the State's shareholding below the 50 per cent level.</P>
    <P>The final decision on the precise size of the offer will be one which will be taken in consultation with my Government colleagues closer to the time of the offer and will depend largely on equity market conditions. Likewise, the issue of what proportion of shares will be retained by Government and for how long will also be taken by Government.</P>
    <P>One of our stated objectives of the IPO is that it should promote wider share ownership. However, I expect there will be a significant tranche of the shares available to the citizens. It is a <Col N="1277" /> personal objective of mine, and I know Government and Opposition colleagues are at one on this, that the Irish people should be a significant beneficiary of this flotation. It is, after all, they who have contributed so much to the company's development and success over the years, as is the case with other State companies.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the people in reality covers the entire history of the organisation from when it was part of a Government Department, funded by tax revenues, with the task of providing vital telecommunications services on a nationwide basis to the public and to industry. Telecom Éireann has now developed into a high value player in the world telecommunications market and it is only appropriate that the public reaps the benefits of this success. The main benefit, as I see it, is the opportunity for the public to be part of the future of the company, to be able to share in its successes and to have a say in its development over the coming years. This is the essence of what being a public company means; a company which is literally owned by the people through the widest possible share ownership.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the proportion of shares available to the citizens needs to be balanced by the availability of shares to institutional investors who are so important to the success of any public flotation. While the benefits to the citizens are uppermost in my mind, I am fully aware that these will only be maximised if the institutional investors are allowed to participate in a way that creates a positive trading environment. Having a number of good quality institutional investors holding significant shares in the company is desirable.</P>
    <P>The plan at this stage is to opt for flotation on the Dublin, London and New York Stock Exchanges. While Dublin and London were to a large degree self-selecting, the choice of New York is seen as a reflection of the level of interest that prevails in the US in Irish companies. The decision is also a mark of the confidence the Government and the advisers have in the market potential of the company and the move will undoubtedly act as a stimulus to the ultimate success of the IPO.</P>
    <P>One of the issues I had to address in preparing the company for an initial public offering was that of corporate governance, in particular, the composition of the board. Following advice from the Department's advisers, Merrill Lynch and AIB Capital Markets, I met each of the ministerially appointed directors and outlined the position with regard to the IPO.  Four of the board members agreed voluntarily to relinquish their positions as directors and their understanding of my wish to effect pre-IPO changes at board level was very much appreciated by me and by the Government.</P>
    <P>I state clearly and without equivocation how much I value the contribution made to the company by those who chose to relinquish their board directorships. My request to them should not be taken as reflecting negatively on their perform<Col N="1278" /> ance or their ability. On the contrary, Mr. Ron Bolger has been a distinguished chairman and has guided the company with great skill and professionalism through an era when the company's value and turnover has increased substantially. I am glad he agreed to remain on the board in his new role as deputy chairman where his knowledge of the company and of the Irish telecommunications sector will be of undoubted assistance.</P>
    <P>I also extend my deepest gratitude to those other board members, Maurice Doyle, Evanne Kilmurray, Marie Hurley and Gerry Wrixton, each of whom played his or her part in the transformation of the company in recent years. I very much appreciate the manner in which they responded to my request and I acknowledge their public spiritedness and their commitment.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that Brian Thompson agreed to become the new chairman of the board. Allied to his wide business experience in the very competitive United States telecommunications sector, his commitment to Ireland and his expertise in Irish affairs gained through his work on the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board and the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications made Brian Thompson a very suitable candidate for the job. The other new directors appointed by me are Mr. Ray McSharry and Mr. Jim Flavin, both of whom have experience as directors of boards of publicly listed companies. I know they will bring their expertise to bear in their role in Telecom Éireann and I wish them well.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the substance of the Bill, I will briefly refer to the various discussions that have been a necessary part of the whole IPO process. Participants in these discussions include various Departments, the company, the strategic partners, KPN and Telia, the unions and the former workers of Telecom Éireann. I wish to avail of this opportunity to thank each of the groups involved for their positive contribution which has ensured the success of the whole consultation process to date and I look forward to a continuation of it in the future.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill may be grouped into four broad categories. The first of these concerns those provisions needed to permit the initial public offering of shares in the company. This includes providing a mechanism whereby the expenses of the process may be paid. In this instance, it is proposed that this should be done by way of moneys voted by the Oireachtas to the annual Vote of my Department.</P>
    <P>A further provision in this category is set out in section 8. The purpose of this provision is one of clarification. The first part clarifies the provision in section 9 of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 which concerns the Minister's powers to enter into agreements for the sale and/or issue of equity in the company and the scope of such agreements. The second part of this provision confirms the non-application of section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963 to certain specific arrangements involving <Col N="1279" /> the company. The existing exemption from this section was given to Telecom Éireann in the 1996 Act in the context of the strategic alliance. The purpose of the proposed amendment in the Bill is to extend the exemption to cover other share transactions by the company's shareholders pursuant to agreements entered into by the Ministers for Finance and Public Enterprise, including the ESOP agreement.</P>
    <P>The second broad category relates to matters of concern to the employees of the company and is mainly covered by sections 4 and 5 of the Bill. Section 4 is concerned with the superannuation entitlements of Telecom Éireann staff who were former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It provides that the superannuation entitlements of such staff in the company are maintained at a level at least equal to that which they enjoyed immediately before the vesting day of the company on 1 January 1984. The provision also makes clear that this applies equally to those staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who retired or the beneficiaries of those who died before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>Section 5 removes Telecom Éireann from the scope of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, on the basis that such obligations are inconsistent with it being a publicly quoted company.</P>
    <P>Following the change in the status of the company, therefore, and as is the case with such companies, its board membership will be determined largely by the size of shareholding. Before this change happens, however, there will be an interim period and the Bill seeks to cater for this by providing that the present worker directors and their alternates are to remain in office until the appointment of the new board of the company. To accommodate this the Bill gives the Minister the power to specify by order the date on which their term of office ends. I am considering this issue at present and will consult with my Cabinet colleagues. I have also met with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions and I have spoken with them about this issue on a general level. I have also met, and will continue to meet, with representatives of the Communications Workers Union on this issue.</P>
    <P>The third broad category dealt with in the Bill concerns the repeal or limiting of certain existing provisions so that Telecom Éireann is put on an equal footing with other operators in the telecommunications sector. These include provisions which, for example, currently give the company power to prosecute various offences, for instance under the Telegraphs Acts. No other telecommunications operator in Ireland or publicly quoted company is empowered in this way and in the light of its imminent change of status such powers are now inappropriate to Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The power of the Minister to issue policy directions is also seen as inappropriate to a company with an obligation to its shareholders to pursue a <Col N="1280" /> commercial mandate. This power, which will put me in my box&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;is to be strictly limited to issuing directions for purposes of interception of messages under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages Act, 1993. I do not think I ever invoked this. It is the intention that this will be extended to other operators in the sector as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Linked closely to this third category is the fourth and final broad set of provisions. This is required to ensure the company operates on much the same basis as not just other telecommunications companies, but other publicly quoted companies operating under the Companies Acts. In line with this I have included section 3 of the Bill under this heading. This section repeals certain parts of section 46 of the 1983 Act relating to the company's obligations regarding the superannuation schemes that it establishes, such as the requirement for ministerial approval of such schemes.</P>
      <P>As well as the various parts of section 46 put forward for repeal in section 3, those subsections which concern the Minister for Finance's contributions to superannuation schemes covering former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are also identified for the purpose of repeal in the Second Schedule. These provisions, however, will only be repealed when the Minister for Finance decides to discharge his liability in this regard and the decision on this issue rests fully with the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Government.</P>
      <P>To a great extent the remainder of this category comprises the repeal of various existing provisions as identified in the Schedules to the Bill. The provisions being repealed are seen as inconsistent with the proposed new status of the company. They cover issues that would normally be dealt with under the Companies Acts or in the memorandum and articles of association of a company such as those in relation to loans which the company might wish to take out and their borrowing limits.</P>
      <P>As regards commencement of the Act, section 9 provides that the Minister may by order bring different provisions of the Act into force at different times. The timing of the orders will to a large extent be dependent on the progress achieved on the various elements of the IPO process that I have touched upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined the background and the main provisions of the Bill. The Government sees the completion of the IPO process and the transformation of Telecom Éireann into a commercially driven, publicly quoted telecoms operator as a major milestone in the achievement of a competitive, high-quality and customer focused market in telecommunications in Ireland. The importance for Ireland's global competitiveness in achieving <Col N="1281" /> this goal simply cannot be stressed strongly enough.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, and as is proper when a Bill of real importance is before the House, I wish to thank the workers who, since the foundation of the State and beforehand, have worked in the telecoms industry at a time when it was largely a mystery to all of us. Those public spirited and public minded employees worked faithfully in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and then Telecom Éireann. Without doubt they gave the company the performance and status it has and dedicated their lives to working in it. I also thank the Ministers from various parties who over the years had responsibility in this area for the public minded way in which they attended to their public duties without fail or exception. Many of them did so through difficult times. I also thank the members of the boards down through the years who gave of their time in a very civic minded way so that this company continues to be a backbone for the country. At a time like this we should remember those who have passed on from their duties and who took their duties so seriously <i>pro bono publico</i>.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in paying tribute to those whom she mentioned. Since 1984 in particular, when the Department of Post and Telegraphs became An Post and Telecom Éireann, the culture change, financial performance and commercial strategy of Telecom Éireann have been very effective and huge efficiencies have been gained. In moving from a culture of protectionism to competition, enormous credit is due to those who led and brought about change.</P>
      <P>We will not oppose this Bill but there are a number of aspects of telecommunications, the IPO and Telecom Éireann with which I wish to deal. Telecommunications is a growth industry. Global communications are changing, which makes it very exciting. With charges dropping, the picture seems positive. I would like, however, to put that in a different context. Given that the rate of change among our competitors, not only in Europe but in the Far East and South America, is so rapid, how are we doing relatively, not compared to five years ago? The future wave of job creation will not be in our traditional industries of engineering, manufacturing, food and clothing, but in telecommunications, including teleservices, call centres, computer age companies, software and so on. Unless we have the infrastructure in terms of broad band capacity and cost competitiveness we will lose out very rapidly in this regard.</P>

    <P>I highlight the decision of Microsoft not to come to Ireland as a very serious indictment of the infrastructure here, particularly the lack of effective telecommunications infrastructure. The Forfás and IBEC reports on this matter showed that there were serious defects in terms of broad band capacity. In terms of the infrastructure deficit, one of the key areas in which we must invest is the provision, nationally and regionally, of a <Col N="1282" /> modern telecommunications fibre optic cable network which will give broad band capacity to users.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a jocose reference to directives which she can no longer issue. Before that becomes the case. I ask her to issue two directives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to be jocose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with being jocose. Telecom Éireann requires direction on two specific points, and I will not labour them. About two and a half years ago Telecom Éireann published a customer charter setting out a series of commitments to service, including rebates to people and so on. That charter has not been properly implemented and many rebates have not been claimed as many people were not aware of it. While it is still within the Minister's domain, I would like her to issue a directive that Telecom Éireann's charter, which is not a governmental one, is implemented. The charter guarantees appointment times within 12 months and states that rebates claimed by individuals will be provided, but only a tiny percentage of customers have sought this.</P>
      <P>There is a second area in which I would like the Minister to issue a directive, and these matters directly pertain to Telecom Éireann. Telecom Éireann had an information age competition called IAT which had a budget of £30 million. The winning town, Ennis, was allocated its £15 million. There was a proposal that the runners up, Kilkenny, Castlebar and Killarney, would get £1 million each, which I believe has been provided. However, £12 million remained to be spent on another 47 towns which entered the competition, but this has not been honoured. Before we enter the great new world of competition, I would like whatever commitments Telecom Éireann has made to be honoured in the lifetime of its State ownership of 50.1 per cent. A community Internet access centre, known as a CICA, was to be provided in each of those 47 towns, but this has not been done. Telecom Éireann has been very nebulous and vague in this regard. I would like to see a set timetable for that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the general issues of cost competitiveness and infrastructure before going on to the Bill itself. While progress has been made, I remain deeply unhappy about the cost competitiveness of Ireland versus the UK in relation to telecommunications charges. The National Competitiveness Council, a State organisation, showed that costs here are twice those in the UK. It is a staggering problem. There are two benchmarks &ndash; one is comparison with the UK and the other is the EU average. They are reasonable benchmarks because one could say that in a particular Scandinavian country lease lines are much more expensive. The UK and a European average are important. The European average takes account of all the humps and hollows while the UK, our nearest competitor, accounts for 30 per cent of <Col N="1283" /> our trade and, therefore, is the most important country to monitor.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the cost of a peak time local call for three minutes in Ireland, it is still above the EU average. This is a vital cost yardstick for Internet usage. Trunk calls in some cases are four times more expensive here than in some European countries. If one looks at the two megabyte lease line charges, ours are among the highest in Europe, notwithstanding the decreases which recently took place, and are over 50 per cent higher than in the UK. These are very significant cost penalties. I am talking about Internet access charges based on 20 hours per month on line telephone rates. If one looks at the wider OECD picture, including Japan, the United States and so on, costs here are still vastly more expensive.</P>
    <P>Although I see press releases from Telecom Éireann saying charges are down, it does not present the relative imbalance in charges. As a macro economic developmental engine of growth for the Irish economy, we must be very tough on this. I would like to see pressure and exhortation from Government to ensure we are more competitive in this area.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure is a direct matter for Government. It has been estimated that an additional £500 million is required. Forfás estimated that by the year 2010, an extra 40,000 jobs could be created if this infrastructure is put in place. We are talking about the difference between the current capacity, be it in Athlone or Enniscorthy. If one has broad band capacity, one can do website hosting, video conferencing, allow corporate networks into their global facilities and connect to worldwide operations. One goes from two megabytes to 100 megabytes or somewhere in between. Countries like Singapore are building multimedia super corridors to provide this. When one sees Apple, Fruit of the Loom and Krups moving out of Ireland, one reason is labour cost but the other is telecommunications costs and access to these facilities. Low labour cost destinations did not have the infrastructure before. Although they had cheap scab labour, they no longer have the impediment to investment because of a lack of infrastructure. They have sorted that out and can, therefore, work on their labour cost advantage.</P>
    <P>In the next round of EU funds which are coming up for negotiation, post the 1994-99 tranche, this is a critical issue for which the Minister must win support in terms of developing the country. In effect 80 per cent of the Irish Internet market consists of wholly owned companies of An Post and Telecom Éireann. As the Minister is a shareholder, I would like to see greater competition and a more robust approach because that in itself might reduce charges. Specifically, a target should be set over a two to three year period to substantially reduce charges, focusing on certain ones. There should be a substantial reduction over two or three years. Within three years 90 per cent of all businesses and within five years 90 per cent of all homes should have access to broadband ser<Col N="1284" /> vices. To allow people work from home, there is a need for interactive facilities. We are depending on whoever buys Cablelink to put the necessary infrastructure in place in Dublin. Apart from transport costs and lack of access to airports, this will place regional areas at a huge disadvantage. Without the necessary fibre optic cable, industry will remain in Dublin, adding to the problems of traffic congestion and housing. The plans of Telecom Éireann and Esat Digifone fall far short of what is required. When I raised with Telecom Éireann the criticisms expressed in the Forfás and IBEC reports, its response was that it provides a service on request. This is like asking an industrialist to enter a greenfield site rather than an advance factory.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been much talk about ADSL, a new way of using copper connections cheaply, instead of laying fibre optic cable. How can this be used to meet broadband capacity requirements? </P>
    <P>There should be an all island tariff for telephone calls. All telephone calls should be charged at the local rate. With the assistance of the regulator, there should be a move towards a revised tariff structure over five or six years to promote all island economic development. In the next round of Structural Funds a minimum of £250 million will be required for investment.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister on the way in which the IPO is being handled. I understand she is awaiting the recommendations of the AIB and Merrill Lynch whom she has appointed to handle the matter. The Exchequer has invested heavily in what is a public asset and there are key questions to be addressed. The Minister proposes to float the shares in Dublin, London and so on. I have been advised by stockbrokers that it would be a clever move to create a retail dynamic to drive up the price. By giving the public shares, as opposed to allowing financial institutions purchase blocks of 10 per cent or 15 per cent, one creates tradeability. That is the UK experience. The way to do it is to give the public shares free or at a discount rate. Institutions would then have to buy the shares and in the process drive the price up. The process would be self-financing.</P>
    <P>Between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the shares should be given to the public free or at a discount rate. The customer has paid for the success of Telecom Eireann by paying over the odds for telecommunication services. There are 1.1 million customers and 1.4 million telephone lines. One hundred shares could be allocated, half to be given free and half at a discount rate. If the shares floated at £3.50 and increased to £7 within one year, who would stand to make money? An operator in New York would make a killing and have a windfall.</P>

Merrill Lynch <Col N="1285" /> and the AIB cannot deal with this issue. The Minister claimed credit for ESOP, she should now take the process a step further. When shares were handled in this way in the United Kingdom a much higher price was obtained. The NCB has put a total sale value of £3 billion on Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>There are ten commercial semi-State companies within the Minister's ambit which could be totally or partially sold. A sum of £600 million is required for investment in the rail network, a problem about which I will badger the Minister. This morning the committee of which I am a member met the Dublin Transport Authority. The need for transport infrastructure, be it Luas or rail and bus services, is established but it will be costly. Arthur Anderson is examining how Luas should be paid for. The initial allocation has been reallocated. It is in the public interest that one asset be replaced with another in which the private sector will not invest. The proceeds raised from the privatisation of Telecom Éireann should remain in the Department to meet an acknowledged need instead of being paid to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Minister christened it DOPE, it used to be DTEC. There will be less European resources because of regionalisation and Dublin will be excluded from EU funds. How are we to finance the huge capital transport needs? This is a big headache which will not be handled through the public capital programme or by giving an extra £120 million per year over ten years. We need a new approach and the Minister should go to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and state that we need to earmark proceeds from the sale of her Department's assets for once-off, historic expenditure on transport. If she does so, she will go down in transport history as making a serious commitment to resolving commuter needs and providing a better quality of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

I have tabled a Priority Question <Col N="1286" /> on this matter today and have asked previous questions in the House on this matter. I accept that the consultants advised the Minister it was necessary to change the members and that she accepted that advice. Maurice Doyle is not a political person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a former Secretary of the Department of Finance. Professor Gerry Wrixton is not a member of a political party. I am not putting forward a party political argument. The four people involved have not created any difficulties. It has been a little embarrassing for them to see their names flashed across newspapers to the effect that, in the eyes of Merrill Lynch, not to mention the Government, they were not suitable to be on a real commercial board, as distinct from a State commercial board. That fact would only be underlined if they were to kick up a fuss and their credibility would be further embarrassed. So they have gone away quietly for their own sakes.</P>
      <P>However, I am not in that position as my job allows me to be less quiet about these matters. I accept that the Minister had a right to change the board members and I accept her motivation. However, I fail to accept that she acted without consulting the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. Knowing her experience and style of operation she would have notified some of these people that she intended to get rid of the five.</P>

If she was allowed speak about this, then I should also be allowed do so. <Col N="1287" /> This is an important opportunity and I wish to make two substantive points.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the person who did not resign was a supporter of the Progressive Democrats. I surmise that the Tánaiste said to the Minister that it was acceptable to proceed along the lines on which she was going and, when it subsequently became a problem, she backed up Mr. McKay and this put the Minister in an impossible situation. It also put the four who agreed to go in an impossible situation. They were under the impression that everyone was going.

      <P>Section 2 deals with repeals. Oftel Communications operators have pointed out to me that some of these repeals relate to powers Telecom Éireann has concerning the messy business of digging up roads and putting in wires and cables and so on. We need statutory rights in our objector culture in which people object to everything for no good reason. They see issues of trespass and other problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister should go about this differently. She should drop the repeals as Telecom Éireann should not be given an advantage over Esat. The Minister should give everyone licensed by Etain Doyle the same powers as Telecom Éireann. This would be another way of achieving the same objective. She should not go ahead with the repeals but confer all licensed operators with the powers set out in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Yes. This will go on every call box, van and so on and it is a huge waste of public resources. It is like the ESB spending £4 million on its corporate image when it has a monopoly. It is a waste of money.</P>
      <P>I will return to the pension situation at some future point. The Minister kindly sent me a memorandum on the issue which set out a figure of £725 million to be paid by the Exchequer to top up the Telecom Éireann end of the pension. This is in addition to huge transfusions of money and the ESOP. The total proceeds of Telecom Éireann are being walked away by individuals.</P>

      <P>The sum of £725 million is incredible. I want everybody to have a proper pension, but it is incredible that the amount involved has increased from £460 million to £725 million despite the other sums put in. I will deal with this matter in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of State ownership, we must deal with the cost competitiveness and infrastructure issues which are the key to development. The Minister should seriously consider giving some free and discounted shares. She has created a dangerous precedent in her handling of the board's membership which will cause problems in the future. However, I pay tribute to Telecom Éireann and wish the new non-State commercial company continued success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister and Deputy Yates in paying tribute to the people who worked with the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs and Telecom Éireann over the years when times were more difficult and who made the company what it is now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Telecommunications is at the heart of the information revolution which is changing the face of society. The pace of change in the sector is phenomenal and, undoubtedly, the information revolution will form one of the most powerful forces for change in the new millennium. Politicians have responsibility for deciding what role the State should take in this process and how it can be used as a force to benefit all citizens. The most important issue is how we avoid creating a new division in society between the information poor and the information rich.</P>
      <P>To date, I have been disappointed at the engagement of the Minister in such questions. She has singularly failed to provide her vision of how the challenges caused by the rapidly changing information revolution will be faced by politicians. The Minister has concentrated on the detailed work of her Department but we have no idea of the context in which her individual decisions are made. A short-term view dominates her thinking and I hope that in responding to the debate she will provide a more expansive view of how the rights and duties of the citizen can be upheld as we enter the new millennium which will be dominated by the information revolution.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann has a pivotal place in the Irish telecommunications industry. In common with many other traditional State monopolies, Telecom Éireann has undergone an intense period of change to face up to the new competitive market which our membership of the EU entails. Its employees, unions and management deserve our gratitude for the constructive and positive manner in which major change has been implemented in the organisation. I and the Labour Party believe that Telecom Éireann will continue to play a critical role in the exciting development of the telecommunications industry in the coming decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> One of the most dynamic actions taken by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, since she took office was to bring forward the full liberalisation of the telecommunications market. I compliment the Minister on this policy decision. While many of us on this side of the House have legitimate concerns about some of the implications of this radical move, we recognise the potential growth and dynamic that such a move will produce in the economy. In a system of Government which often suffers from the cautious approach of politicians and civil servants, the Minister's liberalisation drive stands out as a brave and significant decision.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines the role the Minister and the Government wish Telecom Éireann to fulfil in the new liberalised market. The Bill removes the legislative obstacles to the public flotation of Telecom Éireann and transforms the nature of the company. Despite the technical nature of the Bill, it raises major questions about Telecom Éireann and I hope the Minister will respond to these points in her reply.</P>
    <P>By European standards, land line telephone penetration in Ireland is relatively low. Approximately 83 per cent of homes in Ireland have a land line connection while most of our European partners have a telephone penetration level of approximately 95 per cent. This relatively low penetration level has major implications when one recognises that telecommunications will play a major role in the social, economic and political life of citizens in the coming decades. Increasingly, people will access information through the Internet and communicate with each other by e-mail. The Minister is aware of these future developments and has taken significant steps to ensure that in the commercial world Ireland is ready to participate fully in e-commerce.</P>
    <P>However, the impact of the telecommunications revolution goes far beyond the commercial and economic field. The lives of ordinary people and their social and political role as citizens will be radically affected by the telecommunications revolution. Given this fact, there is an obligation on the Government to ensure that the maximum number of citizens have access to information and are in a position to make informed choices. However, approximately 17 per cent of Irish households are not served by the current telecommunications network. There is in this figure the seed of a new division in society between the information rich and the information poor.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that the new liberalised market alone can bridge this gap and ensure that all citizens have access to the new information revolution? How will the liberalised market take up the essential public service obligations that Telecom Éireann previously performed as a State monopoly? Given that the Bill repeals section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, a section which requires Telecom Éireann to comply with general policy decisions made by the Government, will the Minister ensure that the new inde<Col N="1291" /> pendent regulator of the market receives a clear policy direction from the Government to ensure that the liberalised market fulfils public service obligations?</P>
    <P>Public service obligations cannot be viewed as a static concept. While I referred to the percentage of homes which have access to telephone lines, I only used it as an example. The nature of change in the modern telecommunications industry is such that infrastructure and services must always be updated. There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that modern infrastructure connects the entire country. This is a vital economic and social necessity which Telecom Éireann fulfilled in a monopoly market. Now that the Minister is preparing to divest herself of her shareholding in that company, we must be clear about how the new challenges will be addressed in the new market. The Bill also fails to outline the amount of the shareholding that the Minister will float. If the legislation is passed, this will be a crucial issue. Will the Bill herald the wholesale privatisation of Telecom Éireann? Does the Minister envisage that the State will maintain a major shareholding in the company?</P>
    <P>In relation to the owners of Telecom Éireann, we may soon find ourselves in a remarkable situation where one company has a major interest in Telecom Éireann and Esat Digifone, the two largest telephone operators in the State. KPN and the Swedish company, Telia, currently hold a stake in Telecom Éireann and have an option to acquire a greater shareholding. However, Telenor, which is a Norwegian telecommunications company, may soon merge with Telia. Telenor has a significant 40 per cent shareholding in Esat Digifone. The situation could emerge in the coming months where one company has a significant stake in the two largest telephone businesses in Ireland. This matter requires the attention of the Competition Authority and I ask the Minister to indicate the advice she has taken on this matter to date and her opinion of future developments.</P>
    <P>At present there are four worker directors on the board of Telecom Éireann, two of whom have voting powers. There is a large degree of ambiguity about their role in the company when the public flotation occurs. Worker directors have played a significant role in transforming the fortunes of Telecom Éireann and this important contribution should not be jettisoned as the company takes on a new structure. I urge the Minister to ensure that the position of worker directors in Telecom Éireann is bedded down in a new agreement before the Bill completes its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Modern companies can only thrive where co-operation and engagement with the workforce forms a key element of company policy. Worker directors are essential to the future success of Telecom Éireann and I hope that as a shareholder the Minister comprehensively deals with this point before the nature and structure of the company is legally altered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> I take this opportunity to impress on the Minister the urgent need for reform of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996. The recent electricity regulation debated in this House the week before last imposed a duty on the electricity regulator to attend Dáil committees. This important facet of democratic accountability is missing from the 1996 Act and needs to be addressed. The Minister could have used the Bill before the House today to achieve that. I accept it may be more appropriate to bring forward such a change in separate legislation. However, this change should be made as soon as possible. When the Electricity Regulation Bill comes into law we will have two regulators operating different standards of accountability in relation to important committees of this House. That situation is untenable and must be standardised.</P>
    <P>In addition, I impress on the Minister the need not just to require regulators to appear before committees, but to state in the law that regulators should have regard to any conclusions or recommendations of a committee. I urge the Minister to amend the Electricity Regulation Bill in committee to allow for this provision and to amend the 1996 Act to require attendance before Dáil committees by the Telecommunications Regulator.</P>
    <P>This Bill opens the way for the public flotation of the State's shareholding in Telecom Éireann. However, it does not make clear how much of the company the Minister intends to divest herself and the State of. If the Minister sells off the State's holding, it will send out a very clear signal that this Minister and this Government see no role for the State in the future development of key strategic industries. With regard to the telecommunications industry, the State will have hived off the role of regulation of this market to an independent body and sold off its role as a key player in the market through public flotation. It will represent total withdrawal by the State from any significant involvement in telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes a mechanism for the sale of the State's holding in Telecom Éireann. We deserve to know how extensive this sale will be. We should also know whether the strategy follows a blueprint for the Minister's future intentions for other State industries as new competitive markets are established.</P>
    <P>Other points arose during the debate. One relates to the cost of access to the Internet, which is grossly excessive. It is important, if we are to develop in the information age, that we have access to information. There is a strong case for moving vigorously to reduce the cost of access to the Internet. It is dear enough in Dublin but in some parts of the country the cost is excessive.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the manner in which the Minister succeeded, with an 80 per cent success rate, in talking people out of staying on the board. In the world of politics, an 80 per cent success rate is not all that bad.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Roche.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. In doing so I commend the Minister for bringing it to this stage. A former colleague of mine in the Communications Workers' Union, Con Scanlon, told me that he would like to express his gratitude and appreciation to the Minister for the unprecedented consultation process in which she engaged and the hard work put into this. That is acknowledged and appreciated in the Communications Workers' Union and by workers generally in Telecom Éireann. That, in itself, creates a good healthy environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years before Telecom Éireann was vested, I learned three things from my experience as an employee in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &ndash; patience, patience and more patience. I never thought the country's telecommunications service could be transformed overnight. Telecom Éireann inherited a service which required a major shake-up. Morale was low and job satisfaction was non-existent. Losses were running in excess of £100 million per annum. The organisation was under-motivated. A clear strategic plan did not exist, and set targets for management had not been agreed. Staff worked in extremely difficult conditions and most of their <Col N="1294" /> time was spent making excuses for their inability to provide telephones for waiting applicants. Many people had to wait up to seven years for a telephone, and that was only 15 years ago. Ministers did their best, but the Government's answer to Telecom Éireann's problems was to increase the cost to the public and the business community of an already overpriced and inefficient service. This resulted in a market turn-off. The problems, therefore, were acute on vesting day and required swift action by the staff, the board, management and unions. This action was taken.</P>
    <P>However, there is still much to be done. There is no room for complacency, even at this stage. Telecom Éireann built on the foundation of the accelerated development programme to modernise the network in the 1980s and improve the overall quality of the telephone service. I pay tribute to all the Ministers, from all governments and parties who were involved. I pay particular tribute to the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Albert Reynolds. I was involved as a trade union official in negotiations with him at that time and with his Minister of State, Mark Killilea. I pay tribute to them for the part they played in transforming Telecom Éireann into a modern communications network. They identified what needed to be done. Deputy Reynolds killed the waiting list mentality by working hard to get to a situation where people could get a telephone when they wanted one rather than when some faceless organisation decided they could have one.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications in Ireland today has entered a new era, and the challenges that Telecom Éireann will face will be no less demanding than those which it has faced up to now. Telecom Éireann is not on its own. All companies face massive challenges and competition. Despite the winds of competition that have blown around Telecom Éireann for some time now, it is still the biggest and the majority provider of fixed-line telephones, and it is the clear market leader in mobile telephony. Fianna Fáil has never forgotten the contribution to that success of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and of Telecom Éireann. The staff worked under extremely difficult conditions at the time, and it is only right and proper they should now reap the rewards for the hardship they had to endure.</P>
    <P>In making Telecom Éireann one of the most modern and efficient telecommunications companies in the world and one which will go from strength to strength, attitudes had to change. Changing attitudes and work practices is a major problem in any organisation. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs had been doing things the same way for 50 to 60 years. Asking staff to change their work practices overnight was seen by many as a threat to their security of employment. However, I am glad to say Telecom Éireann is now a customer-oriented organisation with an awareness that the customer must be kept <Col N="1295" /> happy because he or she is the person who pays the wages and makes everything happen.</P>
    <P>Now and in future, money will be made in the telecommunications business by transmitting information around the world, and Telecom is one of the major transmitters of such information. It has worked closely with IDA Ireland in the past to attract new companies in the service area to Ireland. Up to the early 1980s, there was no possibility of getting financial service companies to locate in Ireland because of the poor telephone service. Telecom Éireann is now one of the leading contenders for major jobs in this area in Europe. It has played a vital and significant role in attracting foreign investment to Ireland. Telecommunications is one of the major factors in determining whether a company will locate here. It is vital to the survival of any company.</P>
    <P>New services will emerge in future and the prize will go to those who make the right choices. I have every confidence in Telecom Éireann's ability to meet the challenges which lie ahead. It is well equipped and has professional, dedicated and skilled young staff to meet those challenges. The staff are highly motivated with all the expertise required to meet any challenge which lies ahead. Many of them are known to me and I know they are very proud, as I am, of the company for which they work.</P>
    <P>The workforce has made significant sacrifices. Throughout the company, people who were Civil Service oriented had to become customer oriented because they had no doubt that Telecom Éireann could not exist in isolation. It came from a protected environment into a liberalised one. In a liberal and global market with well resourced worldwide players in the era of the telecommunications revolution, the board, management and union realised it was necessary to amalgamate or die and they have already made this decision with their strategic alliance. However, this was not easily achieved. I pay a special tribute to Con Scanlon, the General Secretary of the Communications Workers' Union, to his predecessor, David Beggs, and to the management and staff at Telecom Éireann who worked tirelessly and came to an understanding that they had to move on because the modern world does not stand still for anyone. If the world were a different place, it could have remained as it was and not have bothered with a strategic alliance, but in reality people pass one by if one stands still. They do not want to know why one is standing still.</P>
    <P>As a result of dedication and sacrifices, the people of Ireland will have great pickings from this fruitful tree. However, they too must be applauded for their loyalty because they stuck with the organisation through thick and thin when the service left a lot to be desired. Telecom Éireann still retains the majority of those cus<Col N="1296" /> tomers. That is something of which it should be proud.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary to ensure the company is privatised as stated in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in keeping with the spirit of Partnership 2000. The Government aims to create the necessary climate to facilitate the growth of Telecom Éireann in the evolving information society. I am glad the staff will benefit from the employee share ownership plan because it will give them a say in how their company is run and will allow them to have pride in it.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have been an employee of Telecom Éireann and a member of the Communications Workers' Union. I wish the staff well and know they will succeed because they have the dedication and will to do so. I also pay tribute to the chief executive of Telecom Éireann, Alfie Kane, for the manner in which he has conducted his business since he was appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the previous speaker for sharing his time with me. From the foundation of the State, we slipped into the mode of establishing State-sponsored bodies. They happened more or less by accident and grew up a little like Topsy without much intellectual consideration as to how they should be set up, how they should operate, how they should relate to Government or how they should be funded. A very high price has been paid for the lack in that regard.</P>
      <P>First, there has been a great deal of confusion as to the relationship between State enterprises and Government. Second, there has been very poor economic performance over the years. Third, many State enterprises have found themselves lumbered with a huge debt burden. There has also been, in terms of performance, serious sub-optimisation by a number of the State bodies. Some people felt a position in a State-sponsored body was a sinecure, an appointment for life in which one never needed to break into a sweat.</P>
      <P>The direction being taken in the Bill is correct. It was always intended from the foundation of State enterprise that, when the infant companies grew up and became sturdy, they would be allowed to become companies in the big world removed from the State. In other words, they would be privatised.</P>
      <P>The policy with regard to Telecom at times has been shaky. The policy relating to posts and telegraphs and telecommunications was never really thought through until vesting day in the early 1980s. I was once an employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and strategic thinking was singularly absent from that Department. In 1969, the Devlin report noted that when it examined all Government Departments operating at the time, no planning was done in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brady was correct that there was no strategic thinking on the telecommunications <Col N="1297" /> side. It was amazing that until the middle of the 1980s a telephone was regarded as a luxury. If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs wanted to do anything in this sector, the word would come down from the mandarins in the Department of Finance to increase the charges. Occasionally, when the Department of Finance was a little stuck, it lashed a few additional pence onto the charges. The telecommunications system was not really a communications system but an adjunct of the taxation system.</P>
    <P>All that changed dramatically with the establishment of Telecom as a stand alone State-sponsored body in 1984. That was an inspired decision because it gave people who were technically very adept an opportunity to think about their operation as a company and about the clients who bought the Telecom services.</P>
    <P>I agree that Deputy Albert Reynolds deserves much credit for those decisions. I remember at the time, having just returned to the country, being persuaded for the first time to dip my toe into politics. There was much smirking among the Dublin intelligentsia when it was suggested by the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, that people would not have to wait six or seven years to get a phone. I remember the guffaws among the intelligentsia&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They had their phones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the Doheny &amp; Nesbitt set, when they suggested it was an impossibility that people would have telephones on demand. I remember one well placed economist who used to spend a great deal of time on Teilifís Éireann and other State monopolies pouring scorn on the efforts of the Minister. I do not remember that same intellectual genius apologising and saying that he got it wrong.</P>
      <P>The strategic alliance wrought by the then Minister, Deputy Lowry, was a less happy step. I have always taken the view that KPN-Telia got something of a sweetheart deal, to use Deputy Lowry's own words, but I accept that the company bought breathing space at the time, that the additional expertise was valuable and that the alliance helped with the restructuring of the company.</P>
      <P>This Bill marks the ultimate step forward and, in many ways, it is a model. The arrangement allowing Telecom Éireann staff a 4.5 per cent stake, partly in recognition of the contributions they have already made by way of pension, is inspired, politically wise and laudable. Companies, be they State or private, do not exist as an abstraction, they exist and operate through their personnel. The staff have the biggest stake in any company. It is their livelihood, and it is proper that we should have the maximum financial stake earmarked for the staff of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> I compliment the Minister who has handled this matter with a degree of sure-footedness that does her great credit. It took much courage and skill. A tremendous amount of good work has been done and the goodwill that exists among the unions, the staff and the Minister is the best indication of how wise the Minister has been.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell on the method of placing the balance of the shares. The manner in which we handle the balance of the share placing will be a significant issue. The placing of shares for Telecom Éireann offers the State, for the first time, a unique opportunity to democratise shareholding in Ireland. We do not have a tradition of shareholding here. Shareholding has been limited to a gifted few. The Minister will agree it is important that the strategic decisions made in the weeks and months ahead should grasp this reality and should seek to democratise shareholding and open share participation in the new company to the widest possible degree.</P>
    <P>In other jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom, the placing of shares in State enterprises launched on the market have been a disaster. In the case of the UK, billions of pounds of taxpayers' patrimony was lost because the shares were launched at the wrong time. That is not the case now. I cannot think of a better time to become involved in the launch of shares in this company. In the UK, patrimony was lost because the shares at the time of the launch were grotesquely undervalued. If one examines the performance of some of these shares on the first day of trading, one can easily work out that thousands of millions of pounds to taxpayers were lost. Shares were sold for a fraction of their value. The Minister was right when she referred to oleaginous, purring creatures who drew more than their fair share of the blood and the rewards. Institutions and individuals who were well placed in Britain and elsewhere and who were successful in obtaining shares on day one made a killing. I hope the procedures that will be adopted here make absolutely certain that gifted or well-placed individuals or institutions are not allowed to make a killing.</P>
    <P>I would point out in this regard the rather incestuous nature of the stockbroking community in this city. It is a narrow group and, by definition, there are various social and other interconnections between people. I am not suggesting there is impropriety on their part but we operate in a very small market and it would be possible in that market for institutions and well-placed individuals to make a killing. We need to be cautious to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the advisers who will be ultimately appointed and the financial institutions to get right the price at which the shares will be placed. I hope their fees will be pegged close to the price of the shares on day one of trading and that we will not have a situation, as happened <Col N="1299" /> elsewhere, where people are paid millions for their services when they evidently make the wrong decisions.</P>
    <P>In addition to the shares earmarked for existing Telecom Éireann staff, some arrangement should be made to recognise the role of Telecom and Posts and Telegraphs pensioners. They, too, played their part and it would be equitable, just and widely accepted by the public as a positive move if some effort were made to afford an opportunity of share participation to pensioners, even on a discounted basis.</P>
    <P>In regard to dealing with the balance of the shares, the staff are not the only people who have a stake in Telecom Éireann; the customers have a stake also. Over the years the customers have put up with sometimes indifferent yet improving services which, as Deputies Upton and Yates pointed out, were expensive. The company is beginning to lower its charges. The customers have a big stake in this company too. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Yates that existing customers should be recognised when it comes to the share offer. Whether this should be done by way of a limited number of free shares per telephone line, as Deputy Yates suggested, or by way of a discounted offer to customers, I am not entirely certain. Whatever the process adopted, the existing customers of the company must be given due recognition in the flotation process. Certainly, the customers should be allowed to participate. I would suggest the most appropriate way might be to allow them to participate on the basis of a number of discounted shares per line. That would be good from the point of view of Telecom Éireann also because over the next few months and years it would encourage loyalty to the company. The discounted shares could be looked upon as a loyalty bonus.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider ways of encouraging the broader general public to participate in the shareholding also. The best way to do this would be to limit the number of shares for which an individual, corporate or natural, may apply. This is a good company and it would be seen by the market to be a good company which has significant values. Allowing the wider public to participate in share ownership would be a politically wise decision. I realise that there could be some EU difficulties in achieving this but what has happened elsewhere can happen here with some modification.</P>
    <P>There is only one issue relating to the current operational procedures in the company to which I want to refer, that is the recently announced decision to change the name of the company. I do not expect the Minister to agree with me, but most people are mystified that a leading brand name like Telecom Éireann, which has been well established in the public mind as a quality Irish service operator, should be changed to Eircom. I <Col N="1300" /> cannot understand what the company is doing. I am horrified, as most people would be, at the thoughts that we will have to spend over £20 million on this. I found the arguments put forward by a Telecom Éireann spokesperson in this regard to be unconvincing in the extreme. It does not make sense that logos and telephone boxes should be changed and vehicles repainted. I can understand why companies which have gone through a bad patch should change their name. I understand, for example, why Fine Gael recently changed its logo. In that regard, I would point out that a shooting star is a transient matter across the firmament. In fact, they usually crash to earth. I would not expect the Acting Chairman to agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that I am straying but, given the past weekend, it might be worth pointing out that shooting stars last but a fleeting moment.</P>
      <P>As a person with a stake in the company, because all Irish citizens have such a stake, I object to £20 million of my money being front loaded in expenditure on this piece of vanity. It is a nonsense. I remember the outcry a few years ago when British Telecom changed its logo. There is a need for personnel at the top level in big corporations to cop themselves on. I cannot understand what corporate benefit will come out of this. If this £20 million were put into improving services, to return to Deputy Upton's point, or to training personnel to be customer oriented, as Deputy Yates stated, I would agree with that expenditure but I do not agree with this. Of course that is not an issue for the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a fine piece of legislation. The Minister has made extraordinary progress on this issue. I compliment her, in particular, on the settlement she reached with the Telecom Éireann workers. Each and every one of the Telecom Éireann workers with whom I have discussed the matter is happy about these arrangements and that is as it should be. Their stake is being recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister of the few points I made. Everybody in the State would recognise the justice of giving some support or recognition to the Telecom Éireann and post office pensioners. I am not sure if EU regulations will make it more difficult to recognise the role of the people who over the years have put up with bad telephone services but if there is a limitation on the number of shares for which an individual, corporate or natural, could apply, it would not breach EU regulations. I am familiar enough with Articles 85 and 86 to realise that this involves a competition policy issue and there are strictures, but it does not seem to me to be beyond human ingenuity to work a way around recognising that this deal is <Col N="1301" /> for citizens. Maybe that is the answer. I compliment the Minister on bringing to this House, another piece of good legislation. She has done us and the people of the nation a great service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the rules of the House, I should declare my interest. I worked with Esat Digifone, which is a rival company to Eircell, the wholly owned subsidiary of Telecom Éireann, before my election. I am still an adviser to Esat Digifone and I am also an adviser to Torc Telecommunications, a company involved in the telephone card market.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued by the contribution of my colleague, Deputy Martin Brady, who is a former employee of Telecom Éireann. I was struck by the idea that Telecom Éireann has withstood the winds of change which have blown around it in terms of the investment in telecommunications infrastructure and developments in the global telephone market such as the massive amalgamations in the United States. We have seen the integration of three distinct technologies brought about by three simple products which are probably the greatest inventions of the 20 century: the telephone, the television and the personal computer. The integration of these three technologies is what is forcing the massive amalgamations in the United States and the search for global growth among telecommunications companies worldwide.</P>
      <P>It is that kind of seismic change, which perhaps could not even have been anticipated as recently as the 1990s, which is forcing the change being implemented by the Minister. Telecom Éireann has evolved from a State company under a Department to a semi-State company and then become part of a strategic alliance in a go ahead Dutch and Swedish partnership. It is now moving full scale into a market flotation to recapitalise and refund itself and face the huge wind of global change in telecommunications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The integration of the three technologies to which I referred is forcing huge change. This is being compounded by the relatively recent development of the world wide web and the Internet. It is remarkable that nobody can predict whether or not telecommunications companies which are far bigger than Telecom Éireann will survive in the long-term. It is a strange phenomenon that the Internet is probably the single biggest threat to fixed line telephone companies. Fixed line telephones are expensive and in the near future people will be making 10p calls to the United States through the Internet. It is already technically possible but the voice quality is not great. It is only a matter of time and huge investment by large global players before that technology is perfected. This will present a massive competitive challenge to all telephone operators. It is, therefore, ridiculous for a State-owned pub<Col N="1302" /> lic utility to be involved in a purely domestic market. The sell-by date for that idea has passed.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has been a very strong company in the Irish market. When Deputy Reynolds, then leader of a Fianna Fáil Government, asked it to bring about a seismic change and upgrade the existing fixed line telephone market the company responded very well and the investment happened. That change occurred only ten or 15 years ago. Change was introduced very rapidly. Without the help and co-operation of the staff at that period and without the reinvestment which occurred, it would have been impossible for the IDA to attract computer companies such as INTEL into Ireland. These computer companies settled in Ireland in the 1990s because they believed we had a very good telecommunications infrastructure. It is well attested that a telecommunications infrastructure is a vital decision-making point for inward investors. If we regard that as the first phase of investment by the State and the public in telecommunications, we are now facing a second reinvestment in telecommunications technology so that we can continue to be competitive. We are not attempting to seize an advantage over the rest of the world. We are merely trying to keep up with our international competitors who have perfected these technologies already.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise that the United States has led the field in this area. That country has the advantage of a huge domestic market and ready access to finance. It is also noticeable that the Nordic countries &ndash; and state owned companies in those countries &ndash; have been at the cutting edge of innovation, investment and the taking of market share in the telecommunications market. There is no single model for progress in this regard. Increasingly, the very successful state companies in the Nordic countries are recapitalising themselves in the financial markets.</P>
    <P>Progress in this area mirrors what happened in the aviation industry where deregulation and change was introduced a number of years ago. The two European companies which survived most successfully were Lufthansa and British Airways. These two companies aggressively built volume to became global players in the aviation market. Other companies who did not adopt that very aggressive strategy have perished. That should be a lesson to everyone in the telecommunications market, not least Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>These are the key issues. The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing this legislation. She is to be congratulated particularly for involving staff so heavily in a company which is about to go to market. This is an indication of the Government's position and of a promise made by Fianna Fáil in Opposition which is now being fulfilled. People are often cynical about election promises but this is one which was made and is being kept. It is right that staff of Telecom Éireann should <Col N="1303" /> benefit from the success of the company and of the flotation.</P>
    <P>Estimates of how much money will be raised vary. Some market analysts suggest that a 25 per cent tranche could yield as much as £1 billion. That is a remarkable amount for a 25 per cent share. When Dr. Michael Smurfit was chairman of the company he predicted that Telecom Éireann would be valued at a maximum of £1 billion. We are now talking of a company which is valued at approximately £4 billion. This is a great tribute to the staff, to the company and, as Deputy Martin Brady said, to its ability to retain its customers in an increasingly deregulated and competitive landscape.</P>
    <P>I hope the proceeds of the sale will be ringfenced and reinvested in infrastructure. A huge capital infrastructure gap is opening up in our economy and it is important that railways, roads and telecommunications derive benefit from the proceeds of this sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Yates, Upton, Brady, Roche and Conor Lenihan for their varied and lively contributions. They noted our progress to date and the long road that still lies ahead. I will deal briefly with some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates complained about deficiencies in Ireland's broad band capacity. In that regard we liberalised alternative infrastructure in 1997 and fully implemented liberalisation. A task force is currently negotiating the development of new high capacity telcommunications links between Ireland and major commercial centres in Europe and the United States through an alliance of State and private interests. In the current budget £12 million has been allocated for the broad band connectivity and this will increase over three years to £60 million. This development must include the whole country. It would be entirely wrong to create another elite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the point concerning the National Competitiveness Council. On foot of the Forfás report we concluded ESOP and in one week we took three decisions &ndash;  to bring forward derogation, to sell Cablelink in its entirety and to bring in an IPO. These decisions have had significant knock-on effects. The most important decision was to bring forward the derogation which was obtained in 1996. I do not fault the Government of that time. What was right in 1996 was not right in 1998. The telecommunications industry moved swiftly in those years. It is remarkable to recall that the industry argued it could not liberalise because it had a derogation. This seemed so mad that I quickly decided to bring matters forward. Forfás had recommended this so trenchantly in its report that it cried out to be done. The National Competitiveness Council's <Col N="1304" /> report of November 1998 compared prices and commended most of Telecom Éireann's prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton raised the importance of the accountablility of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The 1996 legislation was unfortunately deficient in this regard. Ms Etain Doyle is not required by law to answer to anyone. She attends the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and acquits herself well although she is not required to do so. This deficiency must be repaired in forthcoming legislation. The 1996 legislation does not say the regulator need not answer to anyone but it is silent on the matter. It was wrong of the Government to make this mistake and of the Opposition not to highlight it. I cannot imagine that the country will be populated by crowds of regulators who are not answerable to anyone. The mistake was rectified in the legislation to establish an electricity regulator. We will certainly remedy it within the next few months. I am discussing the issue of worker directors with the unions and will bring it to Cabinet. The difficulty is that the Worker Participation Acts cannot, in law, apply to private companies. This is the law which governs worker participation. Private companies do not come within the ambit of that legislation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Conn Scanlan and David Begg both of whom I recall meeting in the Department in the July after coming into office, on a courtesy call. David Begg called to introduce Conn Scanlan. That meeting lasted for about half an hour. We then had a few drinks and discussed various matters. Both said there was no plan B, only plan A.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the universal service later. If we are to get into broadband productivity it should be available all over the country. Deputy Yates raised the matter of computers in homes and the need for people to be free and easy with them. The work of the information society is excellent and Vivienne Jupp is a wonderful director. The issue of the powers and accountability of the regulator was also raised.</P>
    <P>In regard to the universal service, in the liberalised environment the Minister of the day would still have a public and regulatory policy role. This will be dealt with in the forthcoming regulations. I am concerned about the impact of the Telia-Telenor merger on the Irish market. It is important that Telia-Telenor make up their minds rather than say they will wait until after June. They have to decide quickly as we are moving on a strategy. We cannot have that kind of procrastination. It may suit them but it does not suit us, particularly now.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel with any of the comments made about the change of name. Those who conceive of these ideas should think of politicians who meet and deal with people on a daily basis and listen to their difficulties, challenges and so on. I cannot understand the reason anybody <Col N="1305" /> would want to change a known brand name to one which will be hard to get one's tongue around between now and the flotation. Telecom Éireann, warts and all, is well known. Its symbol is on vans, jackets and the hustings. People would know what they were buying if they bought a share in Telecom, but what about Eircom? We also have the problem of whether the name should be Eircom-Telecom Éireann or Telecom Éireann-Eircom. The idea was ill conceived. No final decision has been taken by the board on the matter as it has to be discussed further. I hope the new name Eircom will be included in the prospectus. That seems a sensible way of doing it. I do not understand the whole thing. It was odd thinking.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked about the repeal of a particular section. The forthcoming Bill on infrastructure sharing will deal with that issue. No decision has yet been taken on the amount of retail shares. I am of the view that there should be a large amount available for citizens to purchase. We want share ownership to become an ordinary activity, not a mystery and not something for the man in the big house on the hill. I want those in terraced houses to have shares also. Some people have spare cash and they should have an opportunity to purchase shares. As a child growing up in Athlone there was a man in a big house who was reputed to have many shares. At that time I did not know what a share was. I met him while out walking with his dog and I asked him if he had shares. I was about five years of age. I think he considered I was a very precocious child. It should be a fully inclusive process. There should be a competitive pricing regime. I hope with full liberalisation that will all come about.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Conor Lenihan said, in a few years time it will cost 10p on the Internet to call the United States. I note Telecom has finally heeded. I have issued about 12 alerts and 14 other indications to Telecom to give us a flat Internet rate. Lo and behold it is going to do it when necessity drives. That is all said in the best of form. There is no doubt Telecom must go further in reducing charges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked for an all-Ireland tariff structure. There are many advantages in an all-Ireland tariff structure and it is worth pursuing. I have mentioned this informally to Dr. Mo Mowlam and also Telecom intends to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I met Kevin Dillon of Microsoft at a conference this morning at UCD at 7.30 a.m. Since Deputy Yates mentioned Microsoft, Kevin Dillon was full of admiration for what the Government has done for the telecommunications industry. In his introduction he said we had come from being 15th to fourth in the European league in terms of performance in one 12 month period. We still have a long way to go. The big issue is not the rate of <Col N="1306" /> the call to New York, London and so on but why Irish businesses are not dealing in e-commerce. I do not know the reason. I have attended 38 seminars in the past 12 months in an effort to promote e-commerce. We are taking part in an awareness campaign, for which funds have been provided, in the next few weeks. Irish businesses say it will come all right, somebody else will get on to e-commerce but they do not have to get on to it. They will be left behind. Ireland has the opportunity to be the first country in Europe to get on to e-commerce. As Kevin Dillon said this morning Ireland is like a small business in physical and geographical terms. There are no mountains, rivers, boundaries or no language difficulties. We have the chance to be at the e-commerce revolution. The brave people are involved and will forge ahead. Irish businesses are tailormade for it because Ireland, like any island country, has been trading for thousands of years. I will do all I can in the next few weeks to promote the idea.</P>
    <P>We talked about various Ministers, boards, employees and trade unions which have been hugely supportive and forward looking. They are the pioneers of bringing State companies into public ownership. As Deputy Roche said the company will go back into public ownership by people buying shares. People always bought shares but they had no script to show it. They will now own the shares and will be able to&mdash;</P>

I will insist that the customers get decent tranches of shares. Little panaceas mean nothing &ndash; what is wanted is the regime we have brought about. I am very happy with that move forward.</P>

      <P>I insist on calling the people who will buy shares &ldquo;customers&rdquo; but I have just been told by my officials to say that they are not customers but citizens &ndash;<i>les citoyens d'Irlande</i> will get the opportunity to purchase a significant amount of shares.</P>

      <P>I mentioned last night that EU Commissioner Fischler's proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy under the Agenda 2000 negotiations have been rejected by the Government and farming organisations on the grounds that, in their present form, farm incomes would be reduced by £260 million per year and there would be a loss of £600 million to the national economy. Some 50,000 farm families would be non viable within five years and 20,000 non farm jobs would be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parallel proposal for co-financing of the CAP made by net contributor countries such as Germany and the Netherlands received a negative response. I understand the intensive nego<Col N="1308" /> tiations and consultations with other EU states by both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mr. Walsh, have made considerable progress. It is also believed a co-financing scheme under which member states would have to pay 25 per cent of domestic agricultural subsidies will be rejected.</P>
    <P>I understand support is growing within Europe for a French proposal of degressivity, under which Commissioner Fischler's blunt price cutting mechanisms would be amended. According to this idea, small producers would be exempt from price cuts, while direct aid payments to larger farmers would be clawed back in line with increased productivity. Some of this money would be used for rural development. In negotiations, our Government will seek to amend these proposals further by raising the ceiling of £3,900 in direct aid payments at which farmers would be become liable for clawbacks. It will argue the special case of Irish grass based agriculture, where 80 per cent of production is exported, when talks begin in Brussels next week.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 years, the European Union has embarked upon many bold programmes. In 1987 the Single European Act was implemented, which paved the way for the completion of the internal market, where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital would operate. This resulted in the implementation of more than 275 directives and regulations. By 1992 the internal market was, more or less, completed. Ireland during the years 1989-93 received large increases in European regional and social funds to help bring our economy up to more competitive levels. All European Union leaders agreed that an internal market could not succeed unless the poorer and peripheral regions in Europe could successfully participate in such a changing and challenging economic environment.</P>

      <P>I am amazed the debate is not important enough for either the Minister or his two Ministers of State to be present in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>The impact CAP reform now under negotiation at EU level will have on our agricultural industry is alarming for our farmers and everyone associated with the industry. The future of our vital national industry is at stake. Ireland is the member state which will be most affected and hardest hit by the changes in the support arrangements for beef, mutton and lamb that are now under negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is the primary land use in Ireland, accounting for 4.9 million hectares of grass and commonage areas, out of a total land area of 6.9 million hectares. It represents about 7 per cent of the GDP and 10.6 per cent of employment. These <Col N="1309" /> proportions are significantly higher than the respective comparisons for the EU as a whole.</P>
    <P>When the food sector is included, overall employment amounts to some 14 per cent of the national total. The economy relies heavily on agriculture and its associated industries. Around 20 per cent of total exports come from the agricultural sector, together with in the region of 40 per cent of net foreign exchange earnings. Ireland exports agricultural products worth more than £1.1 billion each year to markets outside the EU and, together with its intra EU trade, approximately 80 per cent of its agricultural products are exported.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture is primarily based on livestock rather than tillage farming, with pasture, hay and silage accounting for some 70 per cent of land use.</P>
    <P>If our farming population is not maintained at the <i>status quo</i>, it will have serious effects on the entire rural environment. Our schools, shops and churches, the very existence of rural life, all depend on the maintenance of a healthy farming community throughout the country. This can only be achieved by proper planning and attention by the various Ministers, who must encourage the revitalisation of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the CAP negotiations now taking place in Europe it must be recognised that Ireland is the only island nation in the EU. By virtue of that fact, Ireland deserves preferential treatment in the EU. Our only natural resources are agriculture, fishing and tourism. We do not contribute to the EU wine lake or the EU citrus fruit mountain. If we are to survive, our negotiators in the CAP talks must fight right down to the wire and our Minister must ensure that our population, particularly our rural one, is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Government does not seem to have the will or the way to fight for the survival of Irish farmers in the forthcoming CAP negotiations. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food appear to be blinkered in their approach to the serious problems confronting the farming industry. The concept of the family farm must be enshrined in any future CAP. Ireland's strategic best interest is to seek to defend, as far as possible, the principles of the CAP. These are: the unity of the market; Community preference &ndash; already eroded by GATT for some sectors; and, financial solidarity. Thus, a combination of lesser price cuts, enhanced supply management, continued 100 per cent central financing of CAP and compensatory direct payments from the CAP budget offer the least damaging strategy.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a strong self-interest in achieving a reasonably balanced EU beef market. We are most vulnerable to a surplus in the EU because of our requirement to export almost 90 per cent of production. Reducing exportable surpluses is positive in the context of the World Trade Organisation; in other words, the volume requiring export refunds would decline. A major beef promotion programme geared to restoring beef consumption in all member states is vital. A combi<Col N="1310" /> nation of market balance measures applied across the EU would remove approximately 700,000 tonnes or 9 per cent of beef from the market.</P>
    <P>A balanced EU market would help to close the gap of approximately 30 per cent between EU and Irish prices. The proposed 30 per cent price cut is excessive because first, the budgetary resources necessary for full compensation are unlikely to be available and second, suppressing prices to levels far below the cost of production is a disastrous policy for the producers in the longer term because a significant part of the premium is then required purely to cover production costs. It is vital for Ireland that the suckler cow premium be increased to £240 per cow or 305 euros, as suckler cows are the basic production unit in specialist beef production before payment of the extensification premium. The extensification premium should be doubled to £60 per livestock unit bringing the total payment to £300 per suckler cow for those qualifying for extensification. At the moment, 71 per cent of suckler cows qualify for extensification.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to sheep production. Imports of New Zealand lamb are a significant cost on the CAP budget which must not be passed on to Irish farmers. Voluntary restraint agreements, mainly with New Zealand, currently amount to 255,000 tonnes per year or 18 per cent of EU consumption. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>On the issue of milk production, the European Commission proposal is for a 15 per cent cut in price supports over four years from the year 2000 onwards, namely 16.5p per gallon, together with partial compensation through a dairy cow premium. The priority for the Minister is to maintain EU milk prices and this can only be achieved by retaining the quota system and extending it to 2006 with a possible review in 2004.</P>
    <P>Another matter of vital importance and one which the Minister must hammer home at the CAP negotiations, relates to Ireland's butter fat reference level. That should be increased from the existing figure of 3.58 per cent to the EU average of 3.95 per cent. This would bring a very worthwhile increase in Ireland's national milk quota which is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take off the kid gloves in the imminent negotiations on the CAP reform proposals. It is now or never; the ball is in the Minister's court and he must fight to ensure that Irish farming will survive in the new millennium. He must lobby his friends and counterparts in the European Parliament and ensure that he does not throw in the towel or show the white feather in this vital round of CAP negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture is undoubtedly in crisis at the moment. Prices have collapsed in almost all sectors simultaneously. Farmers' problems have been exacerbated by drastic weather conditions this year which have led to waterlogging and serious fodder shortages. Sometime in the middle of January, a neighbour of mine said he could not remember the last day it had <Col N="1311" /> not rained. Another black cloud now looms on the horizon, threatening to move in over Irish farming. It could make present hardships pale into insignificance in view of its potential to inflict devastation on rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The second round of CAP negotiations will commence next week in Brussels. If the Fischler proposals are accepted, Irish farming will not be able to cope with the consequences in the short-term. We all accept that agriculture must undergo a period of change to remain viable in the long-term. However, the impact and pace of this change must be controlled if the agriculture industry is to adapt.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the cereal sector which employs 16,500 Irish farm families. The Commission claims that without policy change, cereal intervention stocks will rise to almost 60 million tonnes by 2005. To prevent this, the Commission suggests prices be cut to world market levels in one step to make world trade more straightforward and allow the EU to export without refunds. Effectively, this means a 20 per cent price cut for grain which is the equivalent of £57 per tonne for off-the-combine grain. These prices are below the cost of production. Therefore, farmers will not make a penny profit from the work they put in to produce the crop. Grain producers will be entirely reliant on a cheque in the post for all their profits. Surely, this strategy is moving agriculture in the wrong direction? Farmers want to earn their money by working the land and receiving a decent price for their produce. They do not want to survive on the generosity of European taxpayers because they will not survive for very long in that case.</P>
      <P>If we must accept this strategy, we should not have to accept that the proposed increase in direct payments will only compensate for less that 50 per cent of price cuts, resulting in an immediate and significant net reduction in overall profits. The compensation figures which have been quoted are based on a yield of 2.4 tonnes per acre which is completely inaccurate in regard to winter cereals. Adding further to the problem, it is suggested that area aid payments will, in future, be paid between 1 January and 1 March, rather than between October and December as is currently the case. This will mean that farmers will not make any profit until four or five months after harvest time.</P>
      <P>We have all heard what will happen if the negotiations are not successful. I hope the Minister is aware of his responsibility. Rural Ireland is watching and waiting; these negotiations will be his acid test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion on agriculture. The Council of Agriculture Ministers will meet in Brussels next Monday and the meeting is likely to continue for most of the week. The German Presidency is determined to reach agreement on CAP reform at the meeting. Whether it <Col N="1312" /> will be successful in achieving that objective remains to be seen. Whatever happens, far-reaching decisions will be made which will affect the future of Irish agriculture. Its future will depend on a positive outcome from the discussions.</P>
      <P>The most significant changes which will affect us relate to the reduction of beef premia to create the national envelopes, reductions in our main beef premium ceiling and suckler cow premium rights, the abolition of beef intervention and its replacement by a scheme of aids to private storage and a 15 per cent milk price reduction. The Minister has already indicated, in the strongest manner, his concerns about the effect the proposals will have on Irish farmers' incomes and the lack of equity between member states and different types of production. He has taken every opportunity to put this case in bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and his ministerial colleagues, most recently when he met Commissioner Fischler in Dublin earlier this month.</P>
      <P>An issue of major importance to Ireland is the level of compensation in the beef sector. The Commission proposals aim to shift the balance of compensation in favour of intensive production. The Minister stressed the need for changes to be made to favour extensive production and that a satisfactory outcome to this crucial issue is essential. It is also central that an effective intervention system is retained to ensure that, in the event of temporary market disturbances, it will be possible to provide a floor in the market. That situation was seen last autumn when, despite the fact that we got increases in export refunds and private storage, it was necessary to introduce intervention. It had a stabilising effect on the market. It is critically important for Ireland, which has such a dependence on export markets to third countries and is so vulnerable to them, to have intervention retained. We have only to look at the annual report from Teagasc on incomes to see that incomes in the beef sector are among the lowest of any farming enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Commission proposals in the milk sector also give rise to difficulties for Ireland. They involve a 15 per cent price reduction and compensatory premia, which would only compensate for 60 per cent of the price reduction. This inadequate compensation is unacceptable. The proposals also involve a milk quota increase of 2 per cent but the proposed allocation of this increase between member states is uneven. Ireland's share amounts to a 1 per cent increase, while some other member states receive increases of up to 8.4 per cent. This is clearly unfair and not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A complicating factor in the negotiations is the future funding arrangements for the CAP. A report on EU financing arrangements was published by the EU Commission last October. This report addressed the complaints by some member states that the burden of their net contributions is excessive. One of the options put forward by the Commission to redress the imbalance is co-financing of direct payments to farmers by the EU and member states. Co-financing is com<Col N="1313" /> pletely unacceptable to the farming community. At last month's Council of Agriculture Ministers' meeting the Minister pointed out that the Common Agricultural Policy has been built up over 40 years on three central principles, market unity, Community preference and common financial responsibility, and that it has contributed enormously to the solidarity which has cemented the Community over the years. We cannot now begin to dismantle that achievement to provide a partial answer to a problem that goes far beyond the CAP.</P>
    <P>I welcome Government approval for the early introduction of the new farm assist scheme which is designed to benefit farmers on low income. Entitlement to payment under the new scheme will be effective from the first week of April 1999. To allow for the necessary preparatory work, including means testing, the first payments, which will be backdated to April, will issue in the first week of June.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the early introduction of this scheme will be part of a package of measures designed to form a practical response by the Government to the real plight of low income farmers. It will not only benefit farm families with children but will also provide increased payments to couples without children and to single farmers. To facilitate the introduction of the scheme from April, the Government is allocating an additional £10 million in total for the new scheme in 1999, which will bring to £43 million the total sum being provided to assist farmers on low incomes in a full year.</P>
    <P>In view of the imminent introduction of the farm assist scheme, the signing on arrangements associated with the current smallholder's assistance scheme are being suspended for those who now seek a review of their existing claims. Anybody thereby qualifying for smallholder's assistance will be transferred to the farm assist scheme with effect from 26 May 1999 and will have their additional entitlements under the new scheme backdated to April 1999. Applications for smallholder's assistance will be taken in lieu of an application for the farm assist scheme for those who fail to qualify for smallholder's assistance but who may have an entitlement to some payment under the farm assist scheme.</P>
    <P>The new farm assist scheme will benefit in the region of 13,400 farm families. This includes the existing 6,600 smallholders and a further 6,800 low income farmers. Features of the new scheme are that it is designed specifically for farmers on low incomes and replaces the existing smallholders' assistance scheme, it will be means-tested taking into account farm income and off-farm income of a farmer and spouse, farmers will not be required to sign on to avail of the new scheme and existing claimants can apply at any time to have their means reassessed if they consider that their income position has deteriorated since they were last subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement made last night by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh <Col N="1314" /> in which he announced details of the 1999 fodder scheme. A sum of £20 million is being made available for the measure. This, in addition to the £21 million paid out in December 1998, brings the Government's contribution to fodder related schemes to £41 million this winter. The Minister emphasised that the current scheme would have two main elements, a general fodder scheme and a special fodder hardship fund. The Minister said that the general fodder scheme would operate on the lines announced on 5 February. The scheme would apply in all disadvantaged areas and covers farmers with suckler cows, lowland ewes and milk quotas under 35,000 gallons. Payment rates will be the same as in the 1998 scheme subject to the same ceiling of £300. Farmers who have already qualified for payment in December 1998 will receive a 50 per cent top-up on their payment.</P>
    <P>The special fodder hardship fund will operate for farmers who did not qualify for the 1998 scheme or the general fodder scheme for 1999. The Minister pointed out that he intends to operate this scheme on a nationwide basis. The objective of the fund is to provide support to cattle farmers who are almost totally dependent on a small farm enterprise as a source of income. The maximum rate of payment per applicant is £450 for farms located in the district electoral divisions designated for the December 1998 scheme and £300 in all other areas. To qualify for consideration under the scheme an applicant must fulfil a number of strict criteria. Teagasc certification will be required and application forms, which include full terms and conditions, are now available from Teagasc offices.</P>
    <P>It is an opportune time for our financial institutions &ndash; I understand there are 37 &ndash; to bring forward a scheme to aid farmers who have severe financial problems and to provide them with interest free loans. If they did that, it would be much appreciated. Farmers' business has formed the backbone of much of the business of those financial institutions down through the years. It is time those financial institutions responded to the current difficulties faced by farmers.</P>

      <P>The agricultural proposals in Agenda 2000, if adopted in their current form, would mean farm incomes will be reduced by £260 million per year and there would be a loss of £600 million to our economy. This would mean 750 farm families in my county of Roscommon would be in a non-viable position within five years. Because of the economic importance of agriculture in that county, it would have a catastrophic impact on agricultural based non-farming jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Commissioner Fischler came to Ireland recently he was not aware of the consequences of Agenda 2000 proposals on sheep production <Col N="1315" /> here. He did not know that sheep prices are a major issue here. The sheep industry is a crucial part of the economy of many counties like Roscommon, but it is obvious the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has not made a case for the sheep sector. Had he done so, Commissioner Fischler would not have sung dumb when he came here recently. The Minister's bluff is being called and he has been caught out.</P>
    <P>Approximately 44,500 farmers, of whom 84 per cent come from disadvantaged areas, are being forgotten about in the Agenda 2000 negotiations by the Government. While the sheep sector is not directly involved in these negotiations, the proposals would have a major impact on sheep prices and production here. That is because, as well as a reduction in beef prices, there would be a similar reduction in the price of sheepmeat. A proposed 30 per cent drop in the price of beef would be repeated in the lamb trade. The proposed increase in extensification would force many farmers out of lamb production as it would be more economical for them to keep cattle on their land than sheep, which would be taken into account for extensification but no payment would be made in respect of them.</P>
    <P>The proposed maize subsidy would also affect sheep production, as a continental farmer would be paid in respect of feed fodder, which cannot be grown here. At present there are 4.9 million ewes here, which represents a drop of 300,000 in the past three years. The reduction will be more dramatic over the coming three years if the Agenda 2000 proposals are agreed in their current format. This prediction is not beneficial to Ireland or the EU as we currently have a net deficit of sheepmeat in the EU. Two hundred and fifty-five thousand tonnes of sheepmeat is being imported, mainly from New Zealand, and dumped on the European market, accounting for almost one in every five lambs consumed in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get three basic concessions from the Commission. First, he must secure the payment of extensification premia for sheep, equating to £9 per ewe. If the Commission calculates it must compensate, it is crucial that an extensification payment is provided for sheep. Second, he must get a guarantee that any price reduction in lamb will be fully compensated through a higher ewe premium. Third, he must secure improvements and regulations in the importation of lamb from third countries. Countries cannot be allowed to dump lamb on the market when they have a glut at home, thereby depressing the price of the Irish product. We must have an even, all year around supply of lamb. The EU cannot enter into any further import agreements with third country markets. These three concessions must be sought and obtained if we are to ensure a continuation of the sheep industry in Ireland. I urge the Minister to ensure we have a viable industry in the years to come.</P>

      <P>The negotiations now taking place are crucial and will set the pace, tone and context for Irish and European agriculture for the foreseeable future. They are taking place with the full support of the House, the agricultural sector and a large segment of the business sector. I support the Minister for entering these negotiations in a forthright fashion, not apologising to anybody, but negotiating on behalf of the country to ensure we get a good deal which will ensure the survival of the agricultural sector and rural Ireland over the next ten or 15 years. We note the negotiations are taking place against the background of the MacSharry proposals which, when effected, had a very debilitating effect on Irish agriculture, something many of us predicted at the time.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are also taking place against the background of the world trade agreement, the consequence of some aspects of which some of us warned about several years ago. They are taking place against the very undesirable face of renationalisation which we have seen in the EU. When entering the negotiations I ask the Minister to ensure the vital national interests of the country are kept to the fore and that we do not see a re-emergence of renationalisation which would be to the great advantage of larger member states.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister, the Taoiseach and all concerned well in the negotiations which are taking place this week. Any criticism is meant in a positive way, as Ireland's national interests, not just in farming, are at stake over the next week or ten days. The future of many farm families and the question whether agriculture will remain the single most important industry in the economy are at stake. The proposals of the EU Commission would cut farm family incomes by £260 million and would destroy rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>One only has to look at the importance of agriculture and related industries in terms of income and jobs in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan to realise how serious the situation is. The failure of the Government to defend the farming community during the worst income and fodder crisis in living memory creates a poor background in which the Minister will defend this major industry and our vital national interest in Europe. Pig, livestock and sheep farmers certainly have lost faith in the Minister and in his failure to take real action to open markets or provide adequate support. As I said last night, dry stock and deer farmers have been left out of the fodder scheme and pig farmers in the Border area have been totally ignored. The quota system for dairying, introduced in 1983, has served the industry well and should not be changed. The EU proposals would cost European taxpayers far more money and would result in a drop in farmer incomes. Why change a system that works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In negotiations which took place in 1983 we were promised that if there was an increase in quota anywhere in Europe, Ireland would have the first say. In this context the agreement which <Col N="1317" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach has already made with the cross-Border group must be delivered. In the context of peace in Northern Ireland there is an opportunity for goodwill to be shown to that region of the country. Farmers and the industry in that area will be watching to see whether the commitments are delivered upon. Delivery speaks louder than words.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take a very strong line against the re-introduction of the May silage subsidy. As the Minister knows, it is only possible to produce May silage in a very southern part of the island, and it will be very detrimental to grass production if this is allowed to be part of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposal for a 30 per cent cut in beef prices is totally unacceptable and the Minister must put forward alternative proposals which will cut back on production all over Europe rather than allow many more farmers to be taken from the land.</P>
    <P>If the EU wants to include sheep in the stocking density calculation for extensification premia, the premium must be extended to include sheep. Otherwise lowland sheep production will end with serious consequences for the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's last minute efforts at European level. When he was leader of the Opposition he and many of the current Ministers had all the answers on how to open markets during the then serious BSE crisis. After their total failure during the past 18 months, the people will watch with interest how the Government will defend and protect our future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals of the IFA and the other farm organisations on how to deal with these issues. I want to see everybody concerned working flat out over the next few days and weeks to make sure the disaster which could happen if the EU Commission's proposals are introduced is minimised as far as possible. That will not be easy. I spent many years in Europe on a voluntary basis and I know the difficulties which face the Minister. I ask him to please use his veto if necessary in the interests of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 negotiations take place at a very difficult time for farmers. Anyone living in a rural area will realise farmers are working harder than ever. Their incomes are in decline, cattle prices are below the cost of production and lamb producers and hill sheep farmers are in despair over prices which have only begun to recover in the past two weeks. In three years cattle prices have fallen by over 20 per cent and grain prices by 25 per cent while last year sheep prices fell by 16 per cent and pig prices by 20 per cent. Pig farmers are accumulating debt at a frightening rate. In Border counties in particular producers cannot even get their pigs slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals are seriously damaging to Irish agriculture and the economy. The Department of Agriculture and Food agrees they <Col N="1318" /> will cut farm incomes by £260 million per year and farm output by £600 million per year. They will affect Ireland more than any other member state because two of the sectors being reformed, namely, beef and milk, together account for 71 per cent of Irish agricultural output and separately account for 37 per cent and 34 per cent respectively. When the contributions of agriculture to the economies of member states is taken into account, the economic importance of either beef or milk to Ireland far exceeds the economic importance of any other agricultural sector in any other member state. It is no wonder the Minister for Agriculture and Food has stressed that major Irish economic interests are at stake in these negotiations. The Government sees that our national interest is under serious threat. The proposals not only threaten agriculture, but the very fabric of our rural economy. Let us make no mistake about it &ndash; rural Ireland is under threat with these proposals.</P>
    <P>We have been told the proposals are necessary to make us more competitive with world producers, such as America, Canada and New Zealand and to bring prices down to world levels. The reality is that farmers are going bankrupt in these countries, something we do not realise. A much glossier picture is being painted, but the real one is very different. The US Government is pouring billions of dollars into farming to stave off massive degradation in its rural economy, and so are the Canadians. Despite all the hype about how great the New Zealanders are, they only have 14,000 dairy farmers left and there will be fewer than 10,000 in ten years time. Farmers in these countries must travel hundreds of miles to get their children into education and their nearest neighbours may be hundreds of miles away. I do not believe this is the type of future we want for rural families.</P>
    <P>The path towards globalisation in agriculture is not the path we want to travel. European agriculture has its own specific characteristics which include different regional identities, a variety of products and a large number of family farms. It needs to be versatile, sustainable, competitive and consumer and environmentally friendly. This is the vision of agriculture to which we can subscribe.</P>
    <P>Some three quarters of all Irish farmers depend on beef which is ten times more important to Ireland than to the EU as a whole. The Commission proposes to increase the extensification premium by a substantial amount from an average of 44 ecus to 100. On the face of it, this is an effective encouragement to extensification. However, it has also proposed to include hitherto uncounted animals while maintaining the qualifying maximum stocking rate at 1.4 livestock units per hectare.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the increased premium are thus offset by the changed method of calculation of the stocking density. Not only, therefore, is there no incentive to further extensification but many farmers who find themselves pushed beyond the <Col N="1319" /> 1.4 stocking density are likely to decide to make up for the loss of the extensification premium by switching to intensive production. We should not penalise extensive producers by taking away their extensification premium and, in the process, encourage them to become intensive, which is hardly in the best interest of the beef industry in Ireland or throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It is foolhardy to drop the protection of intervention while implementing a 30 per cent price drop. Intervention has had a bad name because it became the visible manifestation of what people regarded as a wasteful Common Agricultural Policy. However, in recent times it has been used, as originally intended, not as an end in itself, but as a support to the market in difficult situations. If intervention is the best way of supporting the market at a particular time, there is no reason it should not be used. We cannot be expected to accept the Commission's beef reform proposals without adequate compensation and support arrangements for the market.</P>
    <P>Hill sheep men and intensive lowland lamb producers must also be protected. Under the Agenda 2000 proposals on extensification, sheep would become a liability on livestock farms because they would be counted in the stocking rate without benefiting from the premium. It is unacceptable that Agenda 2000 does not address the problems which the CAP reform will cause in the sheep sector.</P>
    <P>In the dairy sector, some countries want to postpone reform altogether, while others want to see an early end to quotas. Our priority must be to maintain Irish milk prices. This can only be done through the quota system. The proposals which previous speakers mentioned to reintroduce a maize silage subsidy to some countries, which would be worth about 10p per gallon, and not to give an equivalent subsidy in Ireland is unacceptable and inequitable. If the quota is to be increased for any member state, then we must insist that the 1984 EU farm ministers commitment that Ireland will be the first in the queue for any quota increase is fully honoured. Our national butter fat reference should also be increased from 3.58 per cent to the EU average of 4 per cent. Last year and this year we have been penalised for exceeding our butter fat reference, while countries producing far more are getting away scot-free.</P>
    <P>The proposed cut of 20 per cent in grain is excessive and producers will be further disadvantaged by the new proposal for the abolition of monthly increments and the later date of payment of compensatory aid. We have some of the best grain growers in Europe and we cannot let Agenda 2000 damage and undermine our native grain sector. The set aside mechanism must continue to be used to manage supplies and prevent grain surpluses from destabilising markets and depressing prices to producers. Whatever price cuts are imposed, they must be compensated for in full.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> As regards rural development and structures, I welcome the consolidation of all existing agricultural structural measures into one regulation. It is important for us that there is a strong rural development emphasis and we should support this approach. However, the Commission proposals to switch headage from livestock to area payment would discriminate heavily against progressive well stocked farms in the disadvantaged areas and would slash maximum payments by half and should be resisted. In transferring headage to the Common Agricultural Policy budget, the EU must provide the necessary resources. It is also essential that 100 per cent EU financing of the CAP is maintained otherwise CAP will no longer be a common policy because wealthy member states will be able intervene to help their farmers but poorer countries will not be in the position to do so.</P>
    <P>That new resources are not being proposed for the EU budget to cope with enlargement to include five eastern European countries and Cyprus is totally unrealistic. The experience of East Germany, where massive budget resources were required to support development for a population of only 20 million, proves that EU enlargement to include 63 million additional people cannot be achieved on the cheap. Without extra EU budgetary resources, the cost of enlargement will be borne by the existing net beneficiaries of the EU transfers. The impact of the Agenda 2000 proposals will be more severe on Ireland than on any other member state.</P>
    <P>Europe's political commitment to the European model of agriculture is being put to the test in the present negotiations. We cannot have a European model unless we provide the budget to pay for it. If we do not pay, we will end up with the American model which would destroy thousands of family farms in the Ireland and Europe. I wish the Minister every success in the negotiations and I know he will pull out all the stops to get the best achievable deal for Ireland. I thank the IFA which has, in fairness to it, presented the difficulties farmers are encountering without overstating the case and the major difficulties Agenda 2000 holds for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has supported successive Governments in their attempts to secure the best possible deals from Europe for the Irish farming community. This can be expected, as already outlined by our party spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Penrose, in his contribution last night, provided the Government is committed to ensuring farm families have a sustainable income and that the maximum number of families are maintained on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present proposals are likely to have a devastating effect on farm families with estimates of between 20,000 to 35,000 families leaving the land over the next five year period. Unfortunately, this may not be the end of the problem and we could see a further deterioration in numbers in future years. The Labour Party believes we still have <Col N="1321" /> time on our side to rectify these terrible predictions, if the Minister and his negotiating team put forward the most realistic points possible next week in their bargaining with fellow EU ministers.</P>
    <P>Ireland is no longer the poorest EU member state but the agriculture sector is still severely disadvantaged. Irish beef is selling at prices 25 per cent below the EU average. It is indisputable that a tiered direct payments or area based system would achieve a more equitable distribution of farm supports. By focusing supports on low income farmers the flight from the land would be stemmed.</P>
    <P>On average, Irish farmers are the oldest in Europe, with only 12 per cent under the age of 35. On average, they are 15 years older than their Australian counterparts. On his visit to Ireland last week Commissioner Fischler made some important points about the quality of Irish produce. Better training is required, in terms of production and quality assurance, if Irish agricultural produce is to prove attractive to the European consumer. The difficulty is that the agriculture sector cannot attract young people. There is a failure to harness their potential because they are aware they can achieve a much higher standard of living outside farming.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment in recent weeks to establish an expert working group on agriculture. For some time the Labour Party has pointed to the need to devise a long-term plan. A fire brigade approach has been adopted by successive Ministers. It is imperative that the Agenda 2000 proposals maintain the maximum number of farm families on the land and ensure farming remains a viable option.</P>
    <P>In the past year the myth that farmers are super rich has been quashed. It has taken the appalling weather conditions to bring the point home to the many critics on the sidelines. The findings of a recent IFA survey show that 37,000 farmers earn less than £155 per week. The findings of the Roscommon rural household survey show that 50 per cent of households are earning less than £5,000. The needs of this group should be at the core of the Agenda 2000 reforms.</P>
    <P>Seventy per cent of direct income supports go to the 30 per cent of better-off farmers who are engaged in a diverse range of production activities on larger holdings. What is required is a long-term national plan to make young people aware of what farm life has to offer, which accepts that the face of farming is changing with the introduction of new technology and an increase in the number of part-time farmers.</P>
    <P>The points made by Commissioner Fischler about Irish beef should not be ignored. It is proving difficult, however, to have the Libyan and Iranian markets reopened. Irish beef is unique in Europe in that it is grass fed in a superior environment for beef production. The <Col N="1322" /> quality of the suckler herd, however, is not as marketable as is steer cattle. Product development must be at the core. This should be addressed as a priority. I wish the Minister well and look forward to further debates on the Agenda 2000 proposals to ensure a progressive and developing agricultural scene for all farm families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the IFA for the way in which it has presented its case in its detailed document which has been costed and indicates the impact the Agenda 2000 proposals and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will have on all sectors, from dairying and beef to sheep and tillage. No one can deny that the Common Agricultural Policy has been of benefit to agriculture which has been transformed in the past 25 years into a modern, vibrant and intensive industry. The downside is that many farmers have been left behind. Large tracts of rural Ireland are being farmed by elderly individuals. There is no progressive plan to encourage the transfer of land to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to stress the importance of agriculture to the economy. The population of rural villages is declining. Statistics suggest that in the next five years 50,000 will leave the land. This is impacting on school numbers. Those who have been reared on farms want a better future. Unless structures are put in place to reinvigorate rural areas, there will be theme parks throughout rural Ireland and congestion in our cities. The American model has failed. Villages across the mid-west have been decimated. Recently the French Government advertised in international newspapers to encourage non-nationals to purchase land in certain areas to ensure the survival of rural communities.</P>
      <P>The enlargement of the European Union is politically unstoppable. This is welcome to ensure stability on its eastern frontier. The downside is that no provision has been made in the EU budget to facilitate this. The funds currently available under the Common Agricultural Policy should not be redirected for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle aims of the Common Agricultural Policy have been laid down in stone. They include free access to markets, impartiality and a commitment to support rural communities. Agriculture has been transformed to the point where we now have some of the finest and most efficient dairy and tillage farmers in the world. We also produce the finest beef in the world. This can be put down to the transfer of funds. The downside is that many farmers have been left behind, mainly in areas where land is poor and which are removed from the major milk markets of Cork and Dublin in which dairy farming is prospering and there are large herds which can support a family. Outside these areas many family farms are no longer viable without financial support. It is <Col N="1323" /> important that we have a national plan which outlines the strategic plans for agriculture for the foreseeable future. Farmers are most concerned about the huge uncertainties. There are rumours that quotas will be abolished in 2006. Any such move will have to be planned strategically. I would prefer if quotas remained as supply control management has been successful in the dairy sector. Farmers want to work for a living. They do want to have to wait for a cheque from Brussels, they want to earn their livelihoods and sell a quality product on EU and world markets. I fear the worst if there is no plan which assures farmers of where they are going so they can reinvest in and reinvigorate their businesses.</P>
    <P>Equality between member states has been mentioned by several speakers. I am disappointed with the Commission's proposals on the national envelope. This will be the death-knell of the Common Agricultural Policy as the word &ldquo;common&rdquo; should mean that every country will be treated equally.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to maize arable aid, the impact on prices and the efficiency of farmers in other member states. We are at a disadvantage on a number of fronts. We are the only remaining island nation and peripherality is a cost factor which must always be taken into account. The Government has given priority to ensuring that Ireland's position is made clear in the negotiations. There can be no undermining of funding for rural Ireland, particularly for farming communities.</P>
    <P>The beef industry has gone through a difficult time in recent years. Much of this is due to over-supply and intervention. Intervention should remain but it is not the answer as it is too costly. We are grant-aiding farmers to produce beef, which is in over-supply. It is put into intervention and sold in two or three years at a reduced price. We must look at the supply controls with regard to beef and remove stock which breed poor animals unacceptable to supermarkets. If we are serious we have to look at the culling of suckler herds and concentrate on breeding animals for which there is a market.</P>
    <P>The price for beef in other EU countries is 25 per cent higher than Irish farmers are being paid. We export 90 per cent of our animals so we are vulnerable and fully dependent on EU and world markets. We are nearing the completion of the first round of the GATT and now face into WTO negotiations which will further complicate matters. The Government must take a strong line in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and CAP reform to ensure that our national interest is protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has met many of his EU counterparts to lobby the strategic point that we are so dependent on agriculture. We remain a rural-based society and agriculture is the only way to sustain its viability. The IFA made proposals to Government and the Commission on CAP reform in a successful and ambitious document. We would all jump for joy if we were able to <Col N="1324" /> secure the full package it has outlined. I am confident that the full weight of the Irish diplomatic service, the Government and farming lobby groups will ensure solidarity among European farmers so that our national interest will be protected, ensuring a future for agriculture.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about sustaining rural Ireland we have to remove the uncertainty with regard to quotas, intervention, world markets and the direction in which we are moving. Until such time as we remove that uncertainty, farmers will be less inclined the upgrade their facilities to ensure their viability and the continuation of an industry which has survived many knocks. This is a critical time. I wish the Minister and Minister of State well. Deputy O'Keeffe has been vigorous in his attempts to meet farming communities and has listened intently to them. I compliment him and hope that good news will emanate from Europe in the next few weeks regarding agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the proposed reform of the CAP. There is no doubt that the current negotiations will fundamentally change the face of Irish agriculture up to 2006. They will also have serious consequences for the Exchequer. I assure the Government that we will support its negotiating strategy in the national interest to ensure that the impact of the proposals is minimised and that the best possible future can be carved out for agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is important to take an overview of the three driving forces behind the reforms. The current political situation in the EU will make our negotiating strategy more difficult. The defeat of Helmut Kohl's Government is a major loss to small countries, particularly Ireland. He had a sympathy with the agricultural industry which is manifestly absent in the new German Government. He also had a vision of Europe and the role of small member states.</P>
      <P>Thirteen of the 15 member states are now headed by socialist governments and sympathies have significantly moved away from primary producers to consumers. The previous balance in the debate is now lacking. A number of the net contributors to the EU, such as Germany, the Netherlands and other heavy hitters in the Council of Ministers, are seeking reductions in their contributions. This places the debate in context and makes the negotiations very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 2002 or 2003, enlargement will see five new member states joining the EU, with perhaps another five joining by the time the current reforms are completed in 2006. This explains the momentum behind trying to conclude these negotiations before the enlargement process is completed. There are also the WTO talks and the increasing demands by non-EU countries for more liberalisation of trade. All of these issues mean that the Government face an enormous and daunting task and we wish them well. However, <Col N="1325" /> the Minister's performance does not give us great confidence in his negotiating skills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State thinks he could do a better job than the Minister, Deputy Walsh. The Minister of State is aware from the in-depth discussion with representatives of the pig industry yesterday that there is huge anger among farmers. Many of them are going to the wall and there is little sympathy for many reasons in the community for the agricultural sector. The Minister's performance has been abysmal over the past two years, but we are seeking a good championship result in the negotiations. We wish him well and we will support him.</P>
      <P>Strategically, three fundamental principles are the key to a successful outcome. This is aside from the issues involving the commodities, including beef, cereals and the dairy sector. The three fundamental principles cannot be conceded because it would mean throwing in the towel to a significant extent. Other speakers mentioned the first principle, which is the common element of the agricultural policy in the European Union. We should not throw in the towel and accept a position where national exchequers would contribute 25 per cent of the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy budget as currently proposed by many of the net contributors to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not on; it is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is not on, but it is a negotiating strategy which will be used by others. If we accept a position where national exchequers provide even 5 per cent of co-financing, it would be the thin end of the wedge. It might be an easy pill to swallow today when there is buoyancy in the Exchequer, but when the economy takes a downturn, which is as inevitable as night follows day, it will be much more difficult for small countries to absorb than the major economies on mainland Europe.</P>
      <P>As a fundamental principle, a single inch should not be given in that area. The consequences would be horrendous and we should not be deluded by the current buoyancy in the Exchequer in terms of our capacity to implement such a policy in the future. It is estimated that it would cost the Exchequer approximately £225 million by 2002, and it would be a growing demand. It would have horrendous consequences in terms of the overall budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food and for taxpayers generally. We cannot afford to entertain the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> The second fundamental principle in our negotiating strategy must be recognition that Ireland is a largely grass based producer of beef, sheep, which is not mentioned in any of the commodities under consideration, cereals and milk. Ireland was significantly disadvantaged in the negotiations in 1992 under the MacSharry reforms. They involved a reduction of approximately 20 per cent in cereal prices and a maize silage supplement. If the current proposal of a 30 per cent cut in cereals is added to those changes in conjunction with a continuation of a maize silage grant to farmers on the Continent, with no proposals to extend extensification to the sheep sector &ndash; sheep are included in the calculations of the 1.4 livestock units &ndash; we will run the risk of seriously undermining our extensively based production which is environmentally friendly, as demanded by the consumer. There would be horrendous consequences for Ireland if this point is conceded.</P>
    <P>The third fundamental principle in our negotiating strategy relates to the two previous principles. The term &ldquo;vital national interest&rdquo; is still recognised in the negotiations. The value of this term has been debased because it is used too frequently as a knee jerk reaction to every minor trouble faced by the agricultural and fisheries sectors. However, these negotiations are not only of interest to 120,000 farmers. They are of national interest to the Exchequer because of the co-financing proposals which are on the table and the threat to our extensive based production as opposed to intensive cereal based environmentally unfriendly production. We should be aware of that fall-back negotiating position which is based on the fact that no policy should disproportionately disadvantage any member state relative to others. We should not be afraid of playing that card.</P>
    <P>Regarding milk quotas, a commitment was given in 1984 that in the event of the quota regime being reviewed, an additional milk quota would be secured for Ireland as a priority within the European Union. It is illogical to accept anything less. The 1 per cent proposal on the table is entirely inadequate for many people who wish to remain in dairying at a viable level.</P>
    <P>Regarding the non-payment of extensification in the sheep industry, there will be major consequences for the sheep industry if beef prices are reduced significantly. The only way that can be meaningfully addressed is by payment of extensification.</P>
    <P>The current rural development proposals are a disgrace. There is little in terms of a financial commitment. I appeal to the Minister to ensure he is not forced into making decisions within a timeframe set by the German Presidency. We will have to live with these policy decisions for the next six years up to 2006. I would not worry if the negotiations carried on until the next Presidency of the EU if it meant getting it right. I appeal to the Minister and his officials to ensure that they are not forced into making decisions under an <Col N="1327" /> artificial timeframe which will have enormous and serious consequences for Irish farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Agenda 2000, the negotiations on which are due to start next week. Ireland, particularly rural Ireland, has benefited enormously since our entry to the Common Market, as it was known in the early 1970s. For example, the standard of housing and accommodation has improved dramatically.</P>
      <P>When Ireland entered the EU, it had a market for its agricultural produce. This ensured that agriculture came top of the list. In the past agriculture was the Celtic tiger when many other sectors were in trouble and not doing as well as they are at present. Agriculture formed the basis of the economy. Many people were reared and educated on small family farms. However, we are now in a major transitional period and agriculture is under pressure in terms of the Agenda 2000 proposals. Agriculture is no longer an attractive option for young people and it is vital that we emerge with the best deal possible from the Agenda 2000 negotiations which may be concluded by the end of March.</P>
      <P>I agree with other speakers that we should not agree to the proposals just because of a timetable set by the German Presidency. We must ensure that we get the best possible deal from the negotiations. If decent proposals for Ireland emerge from the negotiations, it might put new life into Irish agriculture. There is much concern about the future but a good deal from the Agenda 2000 negotiations might kick start the industry.</P>
      <P>Stringent quality control measures have been put in place in the milk industry over the past 25 years. It has stood the test of time and we have secured good markets on the basis of our hard work. The same cannot be said of some of the other sectors. In 1984 when milk quotas were first introduced, Ireland was promised that if there was a change to the system, it would receive priority. The offer of 1 per cent is a disgrace and must be fought strongly to ensure that Ireland gets a fair crack of the whip. On the previous occasion, the 4.5 per cent increase in milk quotas was given across the board. If we are serious about preserving family farms and rural communities, any additional quota that becomes available will have to be allocated to smaller farms. I speak for the area that I represent, Cork North-West, in particular Duhallow which is made up of small family farms. Rural communities are under enough pressure without their backbone industry coming under more pressure. If there is an increase in quota I hope it will be allocated in the way I suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 25 years milk policy was very much to the fore. The co-operative movements were very strong. The production of milk was market driven and the emphasis was on quality. The same cannot be said of the beef industry. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, which empha<Col N="1328" /> sised numbers rather than quality, any animal standing on four legs could get a premium, and one of the reasons agriculture is now in such dire straits is the number of cattle for which there is no market. If we went back to our quality control base and ensured that the beef we produced was of top quality and could be marketed readily it might help. That is probably outside the concerns of Agenda 2000, but it is something we should look at.</P>
    <P>In the context of rural development policy, since the last CAP reform, Leader I and Leader II were put in place, and these programmes were of great help to rural communities. Small businesses were given reasonably substantial grants. These are now employing three or four people and helping to rejuvenate the rural communities. We cannot locate massive industries in these areas because there are not enough people, but if small businesses in such communities can employ three or four people it can be of great benefit to the communities in which they are located.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years or so small villages and towns have come under increasing pressure because of the decline in agriculture and the drain of people from traditional employment to large urban areas. We now have emigration not to England or America but to the large urban centres. If we had told the people who were leaving on the emigrant ships to go to various parts of the world ten years ago that we would be able to provide employment at home, they would have laughed at us. However, we can provide employment in these rural communities if there are serious initiatives in Brussels and in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Government has a difficult task. It has put much work and effort into the negotiations and I wish it well. The German Government has changed its outlook, but I am confident that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Government as a whole and the Diplomatic Service will do everything to ensure that Ireland's case is fought well.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, for his various visits to my area since he took office. We look forward to further visits in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very much opposed to these CAP reform proposals because they will be detrimental to rural Ireland. Without farmers rural Ireland will fade away. Recent research indicates that over 70,000 farmers exist on £156 a week and at least 37,000 of these have no other income outside of farming. Many exist below the social welfare limits. It has been the purpose of such schemes as the farm assist scheme to help such farmers. It is of critical importance that we maintain subsidies because many farmers are sell<Col N="1329" /> ing products at less that it costs to produce them. We are aware of the crisis that already exists in the beef industry and other segments of farming. The situation will be further compounded by these CAP reform proposals.</P>
      <P>It is essential, therefore, that we put forward as strong a case as possible and lobby strongly against what is proposed for Ireland. I do not propose to go into detail on the CAP reform proposals. They have been elaborated already by my colleagues. However, milk is to County Limerick as oil is to Texas. It is a very important component. We know the impact the farming lobby makes on rural Ireland and the dependence of shops on them. The CAP reform proposals will have spin-off effects. Farmers are often criticised by urban people, but urban Ireland itself will go into decay if farming is adversely affected, because many jobs will be lost.</P>
      <P>I wish the Government well. The farming lobbies have to keep up the momentum. We have to indicate as strongly as possible that we are totally opposed to these proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifteen thousand farmers took to the streets yesterday in demonstrations in 28 towns throughout the country. It was not a demonstration of anger or frustration but a demonstration of sheer devastation, sheer worry about their prospects. Under the proposals in Agenda 2000, it is estimated that farm incomes will be reduced by £260 million and that a further £600 million will be taken from the rural economy. In addition, 50,000 farmers will be made non-viable within five years and 20,000 non-farm jobs will be lost in our towns and cities.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Creed that Agenda 2000 is not just a farmer's issue but a national issue. These proposals could have disastrous consequences not only for farmers but for the entire economy. How many industries would have to close down to have the same disastrous consequences these proposals could have on the economy? What would be the outcry if so many jobs were to be lost in other industries? The proposals to cut beef by 30 per cent, sheep by 20 per cent, milk by 15 per cent and cereals by 20 per cent will force farmers out of these traditional areas of agriculture and transform what we have always cherished, our family farms, into ranch-style units.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has a huge responsibility in these negotiations to protect the future of this industry which is still our major employer. He can save this industry only by convincing our EU partners and his colleagues that Irish agriculture is in a unique position and is most vulnerable. We recognise that agriculture must be reformed in order to remain a vibrant and profitable industry. However, the proposals confronting us today will not reform but will kill this native industry.</P>

    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): Last November the Government decided to establish a high level task force comprising officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to prepare a report with prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the review of railway safety in Ireland carried out by IRMS. The task force submitted its report to me on Friday last and I am giving it urgent and detailed consideration. The report includes a detailed five year safety implementation programme covering both infrastructure investment and improved safety management. I will bring the report and my proposals to Government at the earliest possible opportunity and I will make an appropriate announcement as soon as the Government has taken the relevant decisions. In the meantime, Iarnród Éireann has been attending to the urgent safety issues identified by the consultants as well as continuing with its EU and Exchequer co-financed rail renewal programme.</P>

      <P>I wish to be clear on a number of issues. The meeting called for next Wednesday was asked for by me, not by the Deputy. I wrote to the chairman requesting it and he has written to all the Members. I did not ask for a high level implementation task force; it was referred to in the IRMS report. The task force began work around the beginning of November. I received its report last Friday but I was in bed Saturday, Sunday and Monday with the flu, something I am sure has been heard of even in the pure world of Fine Gael. I make no excuse for having it and I am still suffering from it. Therefore, I have not yet had time to read the task force report.</P>
      <P>If read in time, it will be discussed at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting. If not, it will be for the following Tuesday's Cabinet meeting. I insist on reading beforehand what I bring to Cabinet. I received the report last Friday and it will be brought to Cabinet either next Tuesday or the following Tuesday. Its recommendations include a detailed five year safety implementation programme and I will bring that to Cabinet at the earliest possible opportunity. I have only given it a sketchy look and have not gone into the detail of it, I understand there has been a good marrying of what is needed from both reports. I do not have the detail in my mind yet because I have been ill and I make no apology to the Deputy for that. Even in the pure echelons of Fine Gael, allowance must be made for people to catch a flu occasionally.</P>

Given that the IRMS report was damning about the safety culture within Iarnród Éireann, it is incredible that Mr. Behan and CIE management are now proposing to put even more <Col N="1332" /> unacceptable hours on locomotive train drivers.

      <P>I am aware of talks between the Labour Relations Commission, the CIE groups of management, John Behan and the locomotive drivers. They are in discussion together and it is usual in such circumstances that details are not discussed until the final outcome. I do not wish to dwell on what the Deputy said.</P>
      <P>On the broader issue, IRMS was scathing about the lack of a safety culture. The Deputy said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the matter would be addressed with silly, soft notions about training for staff in safety. Some £65 million is annotated in the IRMS report for staff safety training. Otherwise, it was scathing about the safety culture. I am aware talks are ongoing with the locomotive drivers and am kept abreast of that, but I will not go into detail.</P>

Drivers, who are the single most important facet of safety, would be put under undue and unreasonable pressure. Will she arrange for her adviser, Mr. Behan, to change course on this, because it will put unbearable pressure and risks on drivers in terms of safety?</P>

      <P>Both I and my Department have undertaken an extensive consultation process to date on implementing the EU electricity directive in Ireland by February 2000. The process has included a detailed paper, but the Deputy knows about that so I will not detail it.</P>
      <P>The group of unions have made submissions in response to the consultation documents. They are far too detailed to reproduce here but I am arranging to send the Deputy copies of their comments. I believe the Deputy wants to know whether I have met the unions?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent a lot of time preparing my question and I expected a detailed reply from the Minister. Perhaps she will give us a detailed reply because we are not restricted to the six minutes today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy knew it all and that it would be boring for him. I was bowing to his intelligence. I will read the full reply.</P>
      <P>Both I and my Department have undertaken an extensive consultation process to date on implementing the EU electricity directive in Ireland by February 2000.</P>
      <P>The process has included the following: a detailed paper prepared and published in May 1997 by my Department and the previous Minister setting out proposals for implementing the directive; a discussion forum organised by my Department in January 1998 to promote the widest possible consideration of the suggested changes in the sector; and a further consultation document, distilling and incorporating many of the suggestions received, published in May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the consultation process, both I and my officials have had a number of meetings with parties about proposals for the restructuring of <Col N="1334" /> the electricity industry. These included several meetings with the ESB group of unions during 1998, meeting the board and management of the ESB, meeting IBEC, consumer interests, prospective market entrants, including both Marathon and Viridian in September, and I met with IVO/ELF last week. I will continue to consult all interested parties.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the extensive consultation which has taken place that the industry fully supports the early establishment of an independent regulatory commission.</P>
    <P>The group of unions have made submissions in response to the consultation documents. They are far too detailed to reproduce here but I am arranging to send the Deputy copies of their comments.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns of the ESB group of unions is that there will be no barrier to the ESB competing in the eligible customer market. It is my intention that the ESB will be able to compete in that market segment on a fair and equitable basis and this is provided for in the Electricity Regulation Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>All comments and consultations received to date were carefully considered when preparing the current Bill which I presented to the Dáil on 3 February last and will be further considered when preparing the balance of the legislation for the full implementation of the EU directive.</P>
    <P>The second item of legislation later this year will deal with the conversion of the ESB from a statutory corporation to a public limited company under the Companies Acts. It will also address matters such as the establishment of an independent electricity transmission systems operator and a licensed public electricity supplier and will provide for the unbundling of accounts for electricity undertakings.</P>
    <P>The dates of the meetings are as follows: I met the ESB group of unions on 27 March, 1 April, 11 June, 7 July, 26 August, 2 October and three weeks ago. I met Marathon on 10 September, Viridian on 10 September, IBEC on 3 June, the Small Firms' Association on 20 August and IVO/ELF on 11 February. I met a representative group of the unions three weeks ago and their main point at that meeting was the trading mechanism. The two options available are the pool system and the spin system. I told them at the end of the meeting that we hoped to reach a middle way between the two sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted the Minister to give me the reply in detail because I suspected it contained a statement to the effect that all the parties with which she had consulted fully supported her proposal. Will the Minister agree that the proposals in the Bill set aside large sections of CCR? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy talking about the regulator Bill? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1335" />
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Minister's statements on that, some of which have nothing to do with the Bill but which signal her future intentions for the electricity industry. Will the Minister agree the CCR required that the ESB remain as an integrated company, that it remain as a publicly owned company and that a power procurer would be appointed who would be in charge of system planning? Will she further agree that the CCR required that assets would not be made redundant and would only be retired at the end of their economic life? Will she agree also that her privatisation proposals, including the appointment of a regulator and the separation of the roles of the ESB, are counter to what is contained in the CCR, that the out-sourcing contained in her proposals will result in the loss of between 2,000 and 2,500 jobs in the ESB, and that the resultant premature closures will have hugely detrimental effects on large parts of rural Ireland, and I am not talking about the midland stations? Will the Minister agree this would lead to the closure of Tarbert, Great Island, Poolbeg and Marina in a very short time? Arising from that knowledge which I am sure the Minister has, how can she tell the House that the unions fully support the new proposals when they are clearly cutting across the agreement between her Department and the unions which we call the CCR?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's last point, my exact words were that the unions fully supported the early establishment of an independent regulatory commission. With regard to the CCR, on the first occasion I met the trade unions they acknowledged that CCR was compiled in good faith long before any talk of an EU directive. They knew a directive would be forthcoming but nobody had any idea of its content. That was agreed between us and that remains the position. I do not accept the scenario depicted by the Deputy and I do not see any circumstances in which that will happen.</P>
      <P>When I met the trade unions three weeks ago we spoke about transitional arrangements. I alerted the Commission last October and will contact it again in the coming months. I have given the Commission an early notification that I will be entering my caveat later this year, which I am entitled to do. I hope the transitional arrangements into which we shall enter will help matters, but it is the trading mechanism that will be at the heart of the electricity industry. We are currently working on the trading mechanism and the two sets of economic proposals. I will continue, as is proper in a pre-competitive environment, to meet everybody and listen to the various views expressed both by the incumbent and those who strive to enter the market. That is my duty as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the CCR, which took two years to bring from preparation to final conclusion, was not put in place in a vacuum? On the day the electricity directive <Col N="1336" /> was completed, the trades unions, at the request and with the support of the then Minister and me, were in Brussels with us. They were fully aware of the contents of the directive and the direction in which it was going during the period of the negotiations. To say that the CCR was created in a vacuum is simply not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There was full knowledge of the contents of the directive at the time it was concluded.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister also agree that, even if further development is required in ESB industrial relations, we simply cannot achieve that by setting aside an agreement and the Minister coming forward with proposals to replace it in the form of legislation? That is not a way of doing things.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that no later than yesterday the senior officials of the ESB group of trades unions met senior officials of the Department and outlined a long list of their grave difficulties with the legislation? So concerned are they with these difficulties that the members of the trades unions have given authority to the officials of the trades unions to carry out a ballot with a view to industrial action. It is not an old issue but a live issue.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that a strategic meeting within the ESB under the industrial council will be held next Monday to discuss the possible continuation of the partnership scheme with the ESB? Is she aware this is a key make or break meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if she will arrange for an immediate external study into the adequacy of electricity generating capacity relative to demand; and if the analysis on this issue is totally dependent upon data from ESB.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to commission a further study into the adequacy of electricity generating capacity relative to demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I was conscious of the interest in information relating to electricity generating capacity, I arranged for the ESB, in consultation with the Department, to prepare a report which was pub<Col N="1339" /> lished in October 1998, entitled &ldquo;Generation Capacity Requirements to 2005&rdquo;. This report was reviewed by the Department's chief technical adviser prior to publication.</P>
    <P>The ESB currently has legislative responsibility for ensuring that electricity demand is met and any study on generation capacity requirements would have to draw on ESB data. Looking to the future, the Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998, provides for the preparation by the ESB of a forecast statement covering both generation and transmission. This will be in a form to be approved by the Commission for Electricity Regulation, when established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that to deal with power surges the general rule of thumb is that capacity must be 30 per cent in excess of normal demand in terms of megawattage. At the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, Deputy Stagg and I have been advised by the ESB that unless new plant is commissioned there will be power cuts by winter 2001. Is the Minister aware that over the past winter there have been 14 amber alerts whereby the demand for power was so great that they were close to reaching capacity; and that, instead of winter 2001, the necessity for power cuts and load shedding may be more imminent? Therefore, is the Minister not apprised of the need to have some assessment other than that of the ESB as to the real position here given the imminent prospect of competition and the different position of the IPPs and the ESB in this regard? Will she seek departmental or independent assessment given these 14 amber alerts and the need to avoid power cuts in the forthcoming winter? It has been a mild winter. If it had been very cold, the situation would have been much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Any study would have to draw on ESB data. ESB has the data. Neither the Department nor anybody else has it. The ESB has the legislative remit to supply the capacity needed. I am aware there were amber alerts, apart from the difficult Christmas period, which the ESB handled with great ability. The ESB has forecast power cuts by 2001. My Department gave them permission to seek planning permission. Until the legislation establishing a regulator is enacted, I cannot give the go-ahead to build the new plant. I hope that will happen soon. I agree that there is a need for extra power. Two new generating plants are in the pipeline, Poolbeg with added megawatts of 160 which will be ready by December of this year and the IVO which will have added megawatts of 120. Work on this station has started and it will be ready by July 2001. I hope that by then other new stations will have been built or be on the way to being built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred in an earlier reply, to meetings with new IPPs. Is the Minister <Col N="1340" /> aware that all of them are proposing a gas fired basis for electricity generation? Is the Minister aware that there is not enough gas to meet all their needs and what proposal does she have to ensure that the EU directive on liberalisation of electricity supply is met by an adequate gas supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the groups I met has an alternative proposal. They are all aware of the position in regard to gas supply and they queried the Minister of State and myself on the question of potential gas supply and on our plans to meet current and future gas needs. This is the subject of a later question today. The quicker the legislation to establish a regulator is passed the better although I do not suggest that this measure should be rushed. The sooner a regulator is appointed the sooner the ESB will have the authority to go ahead with its plans. Meanwhile, the company has applied for planning permission and for various other environmental impact statements. I have told those who have come to me to discuss plans for building generating stations of the rigorous environmental impact statements which will be required. I have also told them that people are extremely concerned about the environment and about the need for proper environmental standards. They will expect that people will make their views on environmental matters known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act which established the ESB requires the board to make provision and to build sufficient power stations to meet the needs of the Irish economy and people. Is it not extraordinary that the Minister, for fear of Brussels and with no law in place, says that the ESB may not do so? The Minister is preventing the ESB from carrying out its statutory duty. She is telling the ESB it can begin planning but can do no more. Can the Minister explain why one well-established law under which the ESB is required to take definite action is ignored while another law, which is not yet in place, is being used to force the ESB to break the original law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services here. This legislation governs the provision of passenger services other than those provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>In considering an application for a licence under the Act, my Department is required to have regard to whether the proposed service is &ldquo;required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed service&rdquo;. This legislative requirement has meant in practice that licences have often been refused to private operators in urban areas where a service is already being provided, usually by a CIE company.</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance that there are a number of difficulties associated with the implementation of the 1932 Road Transport Act. It is clear that this is a very complex matter and that there are no simple solutions.</P>
      <P>As outlined in my Department's statement of strategy it is planned to carry out a review of options for the effective regulation of the bus market with a view to introducing legislation to replace the 1932 Act. This review will focus on improving customer service, effective enforcement, fair competition and appropriate integration of services. Preliminary work has started on the review and all possible options, including those referred to in the Deputy's question, will be considered.</P>

Is the Minister aware the 150 buses will provide only one extra bus on each route in Dublin? It is an insult to ask people to wait 18 to 20 months for one additional bus.

The previous Govern<Col N="1344" /> ment addressed this issue and I want to be complimentary rather than confrontational given that Deputy Stagg, my predecessor, did much work in this area but did not succeed in getting the job completed. Previous Governments have addressed the difficulty presented by the antiquated 1932 legislation. The criteria for licensing decisions are basic and do not allow for sophisticated assessment of the actual situation on proposed routes. The work done in this area by Deputy Stagg is benefiting me and my Department in the review embarked upon. He met with the various groups representing the private sector. He heard their views about possible mechanisms that might be put in place. Those activities were carried on by previous Ministers. It is my intention to prepare a policy analysis of the regulation of the bus market for presentation in the first half of this year. The review&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his acknowledgement that some progress was made during my period in office when a difficult examination of the 1932 Act was carried out. There were files, which would reach almost to the ceiling of this House, of all the Ministers who had reviewed the Act since 1932. We came to a point where we were close to the heads of a Bill. I am pleased to hear progress is being made on this issue. Will the Minister agree one can consult until death? I did much consulting and found the private sector did not have the capacity to do what it would wish to do. That was apparent from their entry into the market and their inability to enter the Dublin market. If the Minister goes for it along the lines indicated he will have my support. It badly needs to be done. Will he agree that in his Department a group of civil servants, in an effort to implement the 1932 Act which effectively is redundant, is refereeing rows between small private operators who want to provide minibus services to bingo etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he agree the real problem is that the private sector is not capable of delivering a service in the cities? The danger is that British and European operators will move in rather than Irish private operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the substance of what Deputy Stagg has said. As proof of what he has said with regard to his own consultations, none of the main groups representing the private sector submitted written submissions, as requested, in support of their respective cases. Consultation has to come to an end and the nettle must be grasped. This matter has been reviewed going back to 1932. We have embarked on the review and will stay with it because of the particular difficulties that obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a topic on which we have been consulted to death. We cannot continue to consult and carry out studies and reviews, we must repeal the Act and start again. The public do not care whether it is Dublin Bus, private operators or British private operators who provides the service so long as a service is provided. The economy depends on a proper service. Given that there is nothing on the track to offer relief, can a different attitude to applications for licences be adopted? If Dublin Bus is providing a service, I recognise a private operator cannot be given a licence. In many cases licences are refused where a service is not provided or at least until somebody else tries to improve the service. We have an emergency. What is wrong with giving licences to private operators? It is not the long-term solution but in an emergency surely we can accommodate both public and private services in meeting the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with the Deputy. The public want a service and that is what we are here to provide. We should not oversimplify the issue. The Deputy has not done that nor has any other Member. The matter is complex. The Deputy asked about adopting a different attitude to applications for licences. I have specific cases before me which bear out what has been said. I am endeavouring to apply a different attitude but it is difficult in the context of the legislation. I hope we will remedy some of those specific cases in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that in the unit of his Department responsible for bus competition there has been legislative constipation, which is blatantly unacceptable and to which he is contributing? Will he look at the 1988 Act, which established the Independent Radio and Television Commission which has successfully regulated independent radio, and put a similar ten person board in place and let it get on with the job of looking at the balance between Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and private operators? Will he consider that model?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of that, when will public service <Col N="1346" /> contracts be issued, whereby the amount of subsidy attached to a given route is a decision for the Department and CIE to make and is being paid for on a year on year basis?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question incorporates an oversimplification. However, what he is talking about is under consideration. We will consider that and everything else that is relevant to dealing with the situation, in the context of the review we have embarked on. I hope we will be able to produce something in the shorter term rather than in the longer term.</P>

      <Quest>if her chief railway inspecting officer has indicated to her that he is satisfied that passenger safety is being catered for by Iarnród Éireann regarding the overcrowding of trains on the Maynooth suburban line and the Arrow line; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no statutory function in this matter. Responsibility for ensuring the safety of railway operations rests with Iarnród Éireann. Accordingly, it is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
      <P>There are no safety standards in relation to overcrowding of trains, either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officer has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann, drawing its attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review.</P>
      <P>To meet the increased capacity demands on this and other suburban lines, EU and Exchequer funding is being provided to purchase 20 diesel rail carriages at a total cost of £20 million. Of these, 12 are for use on the Maynooth line. The extra rail carriages will allow for three additional services on this line during morning and evening peak times.</P>
      <P>In addition, the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth, the resignalling of the line and the lengthening of the station platforms will facilitate additional train services and increase the passenger carrying capacity of the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news that 12 of the 20 carriages will be designated for the Maynooth line because there is gross overcrowding on that line. The doubling of the track will also ease the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that funding for the signalling &ndash; I do not know much about the technicalities of it but I understand it is critical to the success of the doubling of the track &ndash; is not now <Col N="1347" /> available? Therefore, the money invested in new rolling stock and track will not be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The signalling, to which the Deputy referred, is city centre signalling, and on it will hinge matters for many lines. There is no communication about the city centre signalling project going ahead. If it had been possible to complete this work in the time for the reallocated money, it would have been done. However, it was not possible. First, there is a limit to the amount of work that can be done simultaneously, given the need to retain a reasonable level of suburban rail. There is then a lead-in period.</P>
      <P>The pre-planning work on the city centre signalling project could have not have been completed prior to 2000. However, it is going ahead and there will be improvements in 1999, with the final improvements in 2000. Installation of the new track will commence in the second half of this year. The first element of track doubling will be moving the existing single track, where necessary, to accommodate the new one. This will commence in February 1999 and will be followed by lowering track work at bridges where there is insufficient clearance. Thereafter, the new formation will be prepared. The installation of the track will commence in the second half of 1999. Iarnród Éireann has advised that design work is now well advanced for track remodelling, bridge renewal, resignalling, new platforms and station upgrading.</P>

Apparently <Col N="1348" /> the matter was raised during a previous Administration and did not generate much debate. There is no EU directive on the matter, nor does any EU member state have any guidelines on train passenger numbers as part of their safety requirements.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach expressed frustration and anger in the House this morning that his business and the business of the Government was being constantly disrupted by the flow of allegations published in the media in recent weeks. He has focused his anger on the wrong target. My frustration and that of most Irish people is not with the drip-fed allegations, but with the drip-fed, half-baked responses to them from various sources. If speedy, comprehensive and definitive answers were provided to questions when they were raised, the Taoiseach's frustration might be a good deal less than it is.</P>
      <P>All the matters which have emerged cannot be left to the tribunals to examine. Anything which can be answered should be answered immediately. The proceedings of the tribunal will not be prejudiced by straight answers being given to questions when they arise; indeed, the work of the tribunal might be assisted by its having notice of the answers given on particular matters before it considers them. The idea that the tribunal would be interfered with in some way by questions being answered is incorrect. The Taoiseach has called on Commissioner Pádraig Flynn to provide answers to matters which are before the tribunal. If that principle applies to Commissioner Flynn, it should also apply to other officeholders, including the Taoiseach, should the need arise. I am sure that will be the approach adopted by the Taoiseach in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the material in this morning's newspapers as &ldquo;a load of lies&rdquo;. Yet, the nub of this morning's story actually emerged from a source in the Taoiseach's office. A person in the Taoiseach's office informed <i>The Irish Times</i> that a sum of money had been diverted from a passport account in the ICC to Fianna Fáil. If that statement had not been made to a journalist, there would not have been any story this morn<Col N="1351" /> ing. If the statement was a lie, then the Taoiseach might care to ask himself whether his own highly indirect methods of news management have contributed to what has happened today and to his rushed journey back from Wexford.</P>
    <P>The journalist in question has publicly confirmed that she was told this money came from a passport account, which would clearly be understood by most reasonable people to mean the account into which money for investment was paid by the passport applicant in return for obtaining a passport. Political donations do not come within any understanding of investments, nor could loans to political parties be deemed to be investments. When the Government source confirmed money had been diverted from a passport account to Fianna Fáil, the issue became a legitimate matter of public concern.</P>
    <P>If the donation had come from an account which had nothing whatever to do with the passport application, one would have expected the Government source, who has been aware of this allegation since last Friday, to have clarified matters earlier this week to the journalist, thereby avoiding this morning's story. The source did not do so. Perhaps the Taoiseach might vent the anger he vented this morning in this House somewhat closer to his own office.</P>
    <P>It is not really relevant whether the money was a donation or a loan; indeed this morning's story simply states that the money was 'diverted' to Fianna Fáil, not that it would never be diverted back again. Presumably the money is still resting peacefully in the Fianna Fáil account in a blameless slumber that was quite undisturbed until the Taoiseach's source revealed its hiding place earlier this week.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House that the passports for investment scheme has a murky past and questions will be raised about it. It is well known and indeed, well documented in a reply to a question tabled by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 1997, that the conditions applying to the scheme began to 'loosen' &ndash; to use his word &ndash; between 1988 and 1994. The former Minister for Justice, now newspaper columnist, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has also written that she was 'deeply concerned' about one particular passport for investment case. Against this regrettable background, it is important that the Taoiseach clarify and respond to reasonable queries raised by the revelations in this morning's newspapers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might like to inform the House whether Fianna Fáil received a donation in 1993 from a person who had benefited under the passports for investment scheme or whether the party received a loan from any such person.  If so, he might reveal the identity of the donor or lender, <Col N="1352" /> the amount involved and whether the donation came from an investment account in the ICC Bank or a separate account. If it did come from a separate account, what was the nature of that account? If it was a separate account, why did a senior Government source inform a journalist in the past two days that it was a passport account? Perhaps the Taoiseach would reveal the identity of the authoritative Government source who supplies these newspaper stories which cause him such aggravation.</P>
    <P>It would also be helpful if the Taoiseach would inform the House whether he has ever met the donor in question. He appears to know who the donor is and specifically stated that his party did not make representations on behalf of the donor so he has presumably carried out a lot of research on the matter. I do not know who the donor is. Has the Taoiseach ever met this man who was the beneficiary of a passport or of investment?</P>
    <P>The issue of whether immunity was offered to Mr. Ray Burke was raised in <i>The Irish Times</i> story. I note the comments made by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business in this House this morning that he has no power to grant such immunity. He is absolutely correct in that. The Taoiseach claimed, in a burst of self-ignited anger this morning, that he had been personally accused of having something to do with immunities for particular witnesses. Perhaps he was listening to a different radio station than the one I listened to. I did not hear any such allegations and I was surprised the Taoiseach felt it necessary to deny an allegation which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been made.</P>
    <P>It has not been alleged that the Taoiseach was personally involved in this. It would be quite amazing for a Taoiseach to involve himself in the issue of immunities. The activities of the DPP are entirely separate from the activities of the Taoiseach. There is no communication between the DPP and the Taoiseach of the day. I have no doubt the Taoiseach would not want to interfere with this. Even if he did, I do not believe he could interfere with the issue of immunities. There is no foundation in any suggestion of that kind. I did not hear any such allegation, although the Taoiseach seems to have heard one. I was surprised he reacted in the way he did because nothing of this kind could happen.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the Taoiseach outlined what communications take place between the legal officers of the Government and the Flood and Moriarty tribunals and, in particular, what consultations take place between the legal officers of the Government and the tribunals on the issue of immunities. I understand a partial immunity was granted in one instance. How was that decided? What criteria are used to decide whether an individual qualifies for immunity? If, <Col N="1353" /> as was helpfully suggested to me, this may be done by the tribunal, does the DPP not have a role in the matter? If the DPP has a role, what is the respective role of the DPP and the tribunal in a matter of this kind? </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should give information to the House on this matter. He has some questions to answer about the matter that appeared in today's <i>The Irish Times</i>. He also has some questions to answer about the role sources in his office played in bringing about what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised specific questions which deserve responses. I want to broaden the issue and to raise other questions to which I want the Taoiseach to respond. Between 1988 and 1994, 66 passports for sale were issued and further passports were issued to spouses and children. Will the Taoiseach confirm if the passport in question was one of those 66?</P>
      <P>It is clear from a series of questions I tabled on the passports for sale issue and from questions tabled by Deputy O'Malley that the procedures followed in the issuing of some of those 66 passports breached the Constitution, flouted the law and did not follow the Government guidelines which set out the basis on which such passports were to be issued. I would be interested to learn did that happen in relation to the passport in question.</P>
      <P>Anybody seeking Irish citizenship must comply with provisions in Article 9 of the Constitution. Article 9.2 states &ldquo;Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens.&rdquo;. To comply with that article one must make a declaration of loyalty and fidelity to the State. It is clear from investigations to date that the procedures followed in respect of ten of the 66 passports granted during that period did not qualify under that provision as the required declarations were not made. Was the passport in question one of those ten? </P>
      <P>When applying for naturalisation it is necessary to produce evidence of good character to comply with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act. It is clear from investigations to date that the procedures followed in respect of 49 of the 66 passports issued between 1988 and 1994 do not qualify under that Act. Will the Taoiseach indicate if the procedures in respect of the passport in question come under the category of the 17 that qualified or the 49 that did not? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme was put in place as a result of a Government decision in December 1988. I am indebted to Deputy O'Malley for highlighting the facts of this scheme. The guidelines on the scheme were set forth in a reply to a question he tabled on 15 October. They state there must be substantial investment in the manufacturing or services sector of the economy, there must be the <Col N="1354" /> purchase of a substantial residence and proof of residence for a period of 60 days in the preceding two years. On that basis the Minister for Justice could be entitled to grant naturalisation leading to the issuing of a passport. It is clear that the procedures followed in relation to 56 of the 66 passports issued between 1988 and 1994 did not comply with the 60 days residence requirement. Does the passport in question fit into that category? It is also clear that 11 of those 66 passport holders did not purchase a residence in the State. Will the Taoiseach tell us if the passport holder in question fits into that category? A total of 49 of the 66 passport holders did not comply with the requirement to reside in the State. Will the Taoiseach indicate to what extent the application in question complied with the provisions of the Constitution, the law and the Government guidelines established on the basis of the decision made in December 1988? I emphasise the relevance of that decision because it was on that basis the scheme was operated up to 1994, when, as the Minister for Justice said in his review last year, the guidelines were introduced and were followed since.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to recall that the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, in a debate in May 1994, stated that 25 of the 39 passports granted between 1992 and 1994, were in respect of soft option loans and, therefore, in breach of the Government decision of December 1988. Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the passport in question fell into that category and whether it was granted in respect of a soft option loan and, therefore, on that basis did it breach the Government decision?</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the assiduous exertions of Deputy O'Malley were helpful in highlighting the facts of the scheme. It was also mentioned that his party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was helpful &ndash; I refer to his contribution to a debate on 31 May 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy pointed out at the time that he was informed by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, of the business investment scheme and how it operated. He pointed out that each case was to be brought to the notice of the Taoiseach so that he might adjudicate on it and pass the matter on to the Minister for Justice. He also mentioned that he had brought two such investments to the notice of the then Taoiseach. Was the passport in question one of those two brought to the attention of the then Taoiseach by the then Minister, Deputy Molloy? Were other Cabinet Ministers in that Administration similarly informed by the then Taoiseach? Was the <Col N="1355" /> current Taoiseach so informed? Did a similar regime apply to him as applied to the then Minister, Deputy Molloy? Did the current Taoiseach or any of his colleagues question the role of the then Taoiseach, having regard to the law that applied and the Government guidelines? Did that procedure continue following the departure of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and his replacement by Deputy Reynolds as Leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach? </P>
      <P>These general questions follow up the specific questions put by Deputy Bruton. They focus on the passport in question. The specific questions raised by Deputy Bruton deserve a full reply. I want the Taoiseach to respond to my general questions, particularly in so far as they relate to the passport in question.</P>
      <P>My position on the passports for sale issue is that I am not against the scheme <i>per se,</i> provided it is operated in accordance with due process and the law.</P>

      <P>The format of this debate is unsatisfactory. We on the Opposition benches are effectively operating with one hand tied behind our backs. On at least three occasions in the lifetime of this Dáil when debates under Standing Order 31 were granted by the Ceann Comhairle, agreement was reached between the Government and the Opposition on a format which would allow at least some time for questions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He wants simply to make a statement on which he cannot be questioned and then regard the matter as closed. This is not satisfactory, acceptable or consistent with the pledges he has repeatedly given. It is totally contrary to the pledge given by the Taoiseach in the House on 27 January 1999 when he said he would deal with any allegations put into the public domain.</P>
      <P>There appears to be growing irritation in Government circles at being called to account following the publication of newspaper articles. My party has always supported tribunals, even when it was unfashionable amongst others to do so. We would like to see the tribunals currently under way finishing their work. It would be preferable that a general election should not interfere with their work, particularly an election called for the sole purpose of avoiding the implications of the findings of either tribunal.</P>
      <P>However, I stress to colleagues who have been elected that it is not the Opposition which has been responsible for the stream of stories which has emerged in recent weeks. The Government and its backbenchers would do well to remember this. One analysis is that today's story, as Deputy Bruton said, may have come from a member of the Taoiseach's party. The Taoiseach would do well to get his own house in order before getting annoyed at others. The bottom line is that the fate of the Government depends on the Progressive Democrats Party and the Independents who support it. Once he is no longer able to count on that support, an election will ensue. The Labour Party, for its part, has never had confidence in the Government, but as we have hardly, if ever, voted with it, that is not exactly surprising.</P>
      <P>The lead story in <i>The Irish Times</i> today is just the latest in a series of reports which have appeared over a number of years and that have raised questions about the involvement of Fianna Fáil personnel in the passports for sale scheme. The scheme first came to the attention of the general public and, I suspect, to most Members of the House, when it emerged in 1994 that a £1 million pound investment had been made under the scheme in the petfood company owned by the family of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and that two Saudi Arabians, Khaled Nasri and Najwa Nasri, had received Irish passports as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party was in Government at the time and it is no secret that the disclosures in 1994 created some discomfort for us. However, we accepted the then Taoiseach's word that he had <Col N="1357" /> no knowledge of the investment or the granting of the passports, difficult as this was to believe, especially given that Deputy Reynold's wife had been at the time a director of C&amp;D Petfoods. The water was further muddied by the disclosure that then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, had given the applicants a character reference, although he claimed he did not know the recipient of the investment was the company owned by the family of his Taoiseach and party leader.</P>
    <P>As a result, the Labour Party insisted that the terms of reference of an interdepartmental committee, which had been established earlier, be strengthened with the objective of ensuring that the scheme would inspire the &ldquo;confidence of both investors and the people, and at the same time fulfil the scheme's primary purpose of job creation, protection and investment&rdquo;. We also insisted, in the face of considerable opposition from Fianna Fáil, on the earliest possible enactment of the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Enterprise and Employment at the time in 1993 and my Department had made a submission to the Government taskforce on small industries which argued very strongly for changes to the scheme. My Department objected, in particular, to naturalisation being made available on the basis of investment only, arguing that it should be provided only to the &ldquo;entrepreneur who has been directly involved in the establishment of the business through his efforts and financial resources&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsequent reports added to public concern about the operation of the scheme. For instance it also emerged in 1994 that in 1990 the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government had granted passports to a group of 11 Saudi Arabian and Pakistani nationals, two of whom were under investigation on fraud charges arising from the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI. In this case there was also strong evidence to suggest that none of those who had obtained passports had actually taken up residency in Ireland although this was required under the conditions of the scheme at that time.</P>
    <P>In regard to this case, an internal Department of Justice investigation confirmed that the procedures for issuing passports had not been followed by the then Minister for Justice, Ray Burke, and that most extraordinarily Mr. Burke had himself signed the certificates of naturalisation at his home on a Saturday night, directly departing from the practice whereby this function would be undertaken by a senior official of the Department. We also know that the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, delivered the passports to the recipients at a lunch in a Dublin hotel the following day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> Given this history, which is not disputed, the allegations made in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning are of the utmost seriousness and raise questions of legitimate public interest. The story was written by a reputable journalist in a responsible newspaper.</P>

      <P>I pass no judgment on the contents of the article, but I look forward to hearing the Taoiseach deal with the issues raised in it. Before the Taoiseach turns his wrath on the Opposition parties, I draw his attention to the fact that the story in <i>The Irish Times</i> is based not on any claims made by Opposition parties, but on claims made by senior sources within his Government. Geraldine Kennedy repeatedly refers to &ldquo;Government sources&rdquo; as the basis of her claims. I am forced to conclude this can only mean people associated with either Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>When matters of political controversy are raised in the press and when allegations of the seriousness of those contained in <i>The Irish Times</i> article are raised, the Opposition has a duty to raise them in the Dáil and insist they are answered. If Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party were on this side of the House they would be doing exactly what we are doing. If they did not do so they would be failing in their duty. We did not raise these issues and we are not the source of them. Rather we are performing our function as Opposition Deputies, as Deputies on the Government benches would do if they were on this side of the House. The Taoiseach may find it irritating and annoying that he has to come into the Dáil to deal with such matters, particularly on a day when he was being honoured with the freedom of Wexford city. However, this is the way the process works in the Oireachtas. When the Labour Party was in Government, we came into the Chamber to answer questions raised by Fianna Fáil when that party was in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will find out whether the allegations are real. The core allegation contained in the article was that a sum of around £10,000 &ndash; I am using the words which appeared in the article &ndash; was diverted from the ICC bank account of a passport investor to a Fianna Fáil account in another financial institution. Judging from lunchtime news reports, Fianna Fáil sources seem to be accepting that a transfer of money took place, but are denying that it was the account of a passport investor. The Taoiseach must spell out in detail, if he can, the precise sequence of events, giving <Col N="1359" /> all details, including the date on which the application for the passport was first made, when the investment was made, who the Irish beneficiaries of the investment were, when the passport was issued, and who the Minister for Justice was at the time it was issued. I think these are reasonable questions. Any Opposition Deputy or, indeed, Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats Deputy would table such a question for written reply in the form of a parliamentary question. There is nothing untoward in this regard.</P>
      <P>There is a further set of questions which the Taoiseach may not particularly want to answer because they refer to his party political functions. Was the Taoiseach also treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Party at the time of the transfer? Was he aware of the transfer? Does he know how the transfer came about? Whose names, if that is relevant, were on the account into which the money was transferred?</P>
      <P>I note that the Taoiseach said this morning that the file in question was now in the possession of the Moriarty tribunal. I presume the file in question is the Fianna Fáil file on this matter, if that is a reasonable assumption. In what circumstances was that presumed Fianna Fáil file passed to Justice Moriarty? Was it requested by the tribunal or was the file volunteered by Fianna Fáil or, if it was not a Fianna Fáil file, by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? I do not know.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most serious suggestion made in <i>The Irish Times</i> article was that an offer of limited immunity was made to Mr. Ray Burke at the Flood tribunal if, as stated in the story today, he &ldquo;would tell all that he knew&rdquo;, but, according to the story, this offer was subsequently withdrawn. The Taoiseach is on the record of this morning's Order of Business denying such an allegation, and I accept his word in that respect. However, I have to ask the Taoiseach what information, if any, does he have in respect of this suggestion or allegation? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the tribunal has sufficient powers to grant immunity if it considers it necessary to so do? Alternatively, does the law need to be amended to provide a greater degree of flexibility for Justice Flood in this regard? </P>
      <P>I look forward to the Taoiseach dealing with these issues when he speaks. I regret that, under Standing Orders, I will not have an opportunity to put appropriate questions to him, if such arise or remain pertinent. In effect, as I said earlier, contrary to previous procedures, the Taoiseach has ensured that he does not have to answer questions this afternoon, but we will not be silenced by that should questions remain unanswered. I hope for all our sakes questions do not remain unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the signs are, and I am getting them from the backbenches as I speak, of a Government at sixes and sevens. The tetchy and petulant manner <Col N="1360" /> of the normally unflappable Taoiseach which we saw here earlier today has been very evident. A senior Minister, who is away at the IMF, advised the Taoiseach not to give any more interviews, and the same Minister for Finance, in turn, was publicly rebuked from Paris by the Taoiseach. The Tánaiste's support for this Government, as far as I know, remains conditional and, more startlingly, the founding member and first leader of the Progressive Democrats denounced his Fianna Fáil colleagues in the most scathing and merciless manner.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might well heed the words of Winston Churchill who pointed across the House of Commons to the Labour Opposition and said to a colleague, &ldquo;that is the opposition: the enemy are on the benches behind us&rdquo;. We have, on the basis of Geraldine Kennedy's article, a Government in which senior figures are leaking against each other. A former senior Government figure who is to appear before the Flood tribunal hinted that he has more to tell and that his further evidence could implicate the Taoiseach. We have a Government so diverted by its internal problems that it is unable or unwilling to deal with serious problems, like mounting hospital and housing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In short, this Government is showing all the signs of an Administration on its last legs. We do not know when its final death rattle will be heard, but whenever that happens we will be willing and ready for the election that will ensue.</P>
    <P>On a separate but related note, during the course of the afternoon I have been made aware that Government sources have put it around that I made representations on behalf of a Mrs. Elena Lindzon in connection with an application for a passport. She was a US citizen at the time. Having checked with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I would like to put the following on the record. I confirm that I supported the application for the passport on the basis of a genuine wish to invest in a company in west Cork. According to my inquiries, I wrote a letter to the Minister for Justice on 14 July 1993 in support of the passport application and I wrote again a year later urging that the passport be granted. I have to make an admission and confession that I even went so far as to hand write a note asking the then Minister for Justice to give urgent attention to this matter and to direct that it be granted. The Minister in question happened to be the former Deputy, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and anybody on that side of the House who thinks she would take directions from me or anybody else has another think coming. However &ndash; this may come as a disappointment &ndash; I understand no difficulties have arisen in relation to the accompanying conditions to the granting of that passport and that all of them were honoured. The passport was subsequently granted by former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>

      <P>This issue was also raised by the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, prior to the Order of Business this morning. The information we have is that contained in <i>The Irish Times</i>. That was limited enough but it raises a number of questions. The unfortunate thing is that those questions will have to be answered in one fell swoop by the Taoiseach rather than giving him the opportunity to deal with them one at a time. I trust the Taoiseach's associates in the media will be able to tease out the rest of the questions, as no doubt they will want to do.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that a sum of money believed to be around £10,000 was diverted from an account of a passport investor into a Fianna Fáil account in 1993. The question which immediately comes to mind is how could this State money be transferred from one account into that of a non-Government body. What happened to that sum of money? If it was a political donation, why did it come from an account set up for the use of the State? We all wish to know who that investor was and if that person realised that serious questions would be raised if this procedure came to light. What pledges were made in terms of favours in return for the investment apart from the obvious passport which was, in itself, valued? </P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was treasurer of Fianna Fáil from 28 January 1993, although he assumed the role in 1992. It seems that the former Deputy and Minister, Ray Burke, has now made allegations that the Taoiseach knew about this transaction. A question which will be raised is, who else knew? The allegation that the Taoiseach knew about this transaction was made by Ray Burke in his depositions to the Flood tribunal. James Gogarty has been given limited immunity for giving evidence in the Flood tribunal and former Dublin assistant city and county manager, George Redmond, has sought the same immunity.</P>
      <P>Ray Burke had been given an informal indication that immunity would be forthcoming on the basis of his full co-operation with the tribunal. Following from that, Ray Burke made further statements in which he implicated the Taoiseach, such as, in the past few days the informal promise of immunity has been withdrawn and Ray Burke has been more reluctant to give evidence. Was it the Director of Public Prosecutions who offered immunity and under what circumstances was it withdrawn? Were other banks used by investors availing of the passports for investment scheme? Are similar transactions involved? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During his political career since the mid-1970s in which he has been a close associate of three senior Fianna Fáil figures who have been engulfed in financial allegations, namely, Mr. Haughey, Mr. Burke and Mr. Flynn, has the Taoiseach been the beneficiary of a payment, contri<Col N="1362" /> bution or gift from any source which, with the benefit of hindsight, he now considers to be unorthodox, unusual or irregular? Prior to becoming treasurer did the Taoiseach act as accountant for Fianna Fáil? Were its accounts independently audited and were they ever qualified? </P>
    <P>The charities Bill is long awaited. From information that has come to light, there are 127 bodies benefiting from charitable status which are not in the public domain. Is the Taoiseach satisfied none of these is associated with Fianna Fáil fundraising activities? When will the Bill be published to ensure transparency, the lack of which has diverted us from important national issues. We are obliged to ask these questions.</P>

      <P>Whatever the detail of this revelation, the real scandal is the passports for sale scheme. Trading Irish citizenship in the select club of the world's wealthy is a shameful pursuit. It brings shame on us as a nation, demeans our citizenship and mocks our birthright. While the world's wealthy are sold Irish citizenship, Irish passport holders in the Six Counties are denied the right to vote in elections that matter to them. Our emigrants have no vote. The selling of passports contrasts with the treatment meted out to those seeking refuge from political persecution in their homelands. Not belonging to the multi-rich, &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo; is a different experience for them.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, 8 October 1997, the Taoiseach stated in reply to a question that the passports scheme was not established under legislation. Selling Ireland once meant betraying the nation, now it means big business but only the highest bidders need apply. Such schemes do little to enhance our international standing and leave the political managers of our affairs open to accusations, with or without a basis in fact. It is time to put such schemes and practices behind us for good.</P>

        <b>:</b> Apart from the merits of the question, this issue raises the relationship between big business, wealthy individuals and the political establishment. The passports for sale scheme was a grotesque affront to the concept of equality and democracy. The beneficiaries included the rotten rich, often drawn from the elite of totalitarian regimes, who could buy their way into Irish citizenship by virtue of the money they were supposed to invest &ndash; their ill-gotten gains from the exploitation of their people who enjoyed neither democracy nor fair play in terms of their incomes. Outright crooks have benefited from the scheme and swindled their way around Europe on the strength of it.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am being restrained. Questions should be asked and <Col N="1363" /> answers given. What should be debated, however, is the political system and how it relates to big business. For several months there has been a continuous drip about the unhealthy relationship at the interface of big business and politics. In recent days there have been more dramatic revelations.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the then Government of Fine Gael and Labour picked up the tab for the most powerful financial institution in the country, Allied Irish Bank, when its subsidiary, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, went broke by virtue of reckless speculation on the world's insurance markets. The taxpayer was blithely called on to pick up the tab and no one knew if it would be repaid.</P>
      <P>A few years later the same institution was involved in a massive swindling of the taxpayer by virtue of its offshore bank accounts scheme. It has been alleged that its tax liabilities were wiped out. This is under question. It engaged in covert activities at the expense of the taxpayer. It subsequently wiped out a debt of almost £200,000 of a former Fine Gael Taoiseach having previously wiped out the debt of a few hundred thousand pounds of a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach. A few years later it divided £200,000 between the main political parties.</P>
      <P>What is needed is a debate on the relationship between the political system and big business. If the full story was known, there would be no need to torture anybody in an effort to squeeze out the truth bit by bit. The instances mentioned mirror the relationship between other business institutions and the main political parties. I cite the massive swindle of the 1993 tax amnesty as an example. Powerful vested private business interests scratch the backs of the main political parties and are handsomely massaged in return. Is it any wonder the people are cynical about what passes for politics and political institutions? </P>
      <P>Everything should be brought out into the open. Publish the names of those who benefited from the tax amnesties. Let us have it out in the open. Publish how much they gave to political parties and how they influenced those parties to give them that tax amnesty and other benefits. Perhaps then we will have the full picture of the relationship between the major parties in Dáil Éireann and the fat cats of the economic establishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Orders is a new issue in this House. I spend about 90 minutes per week answering questions on the Order of Business which is about double that spent by the previous Taoiseach. This is an obligation I have to the House. I also take requests under Standing Order 31 or any other debates agreed by the Chair. We have had more requests granted under Standing Order 31 by the present Ceann Comhairle than at any time since they were created and that is a matter for the Chair. I reject allegations that I do not answer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike my predecessors, I rarely miss the <Col N="1364" /> Order of Business as I like to be in the House. I missed one in this session and that was raised against me. I did not behave that way when the last Government was in office. No one from the Opposition can allege that I do not answer questions.</P>
    <P>My first knowledge of anything to do with this issue was on Friday night, 5 February when a staff member asked me if I ever had an account in ICC or access to an account in ICC. He said that journalistic inquiries were being made to this effect. The allegation being made at that stage was that I had a large offshore account in ICC which was going to be exposed in one of the Sunday newspapers. I explained that I did not have such an account or access to one, and that I was not aware of anyone in my family or in Fianna Fáil who had access to such an account on my behalf.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 12 February a specific question was put to one of my staff and he categorically denied the allegation concerning accounts in ICC. The matter was again raised by the journalist on Tuesday, 16 February. It was also raised on Wednesday evening, 17 February.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, inquiries were being made on my behalf into all aspects of the issue, as additional information began to emerge. Most of the information has emerged in recent days. I am given to understand the Flood tribunal got the ICC files on the passport for investment scheme.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the controversy that has surrounded the passports for investment scheme which was discontinued by this Government last year. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform files are with the tribunal. Nevertheless, I want to share with the House the knowledge I have at this stage.</P>
    <P>The files concerned are not Fianna Fáil files but the files of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which were given as part of all of the files asked for last year. The Minister went through the process of the order and the files were sent down. I am fairly certain that files were also sought from ICC by the tribunal and that they have been forwarded by the bank. I do not have that information officially but I believe it to be true.</P>
    <P>Between 1989 and 1994 there were 66 investors. From 1989 to date, 163 people have been naturalised, they include 62 spouses and children and the total investment to date has been £95 million.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that individuals' names should not be used in this regard. The application in question was applied for through proper channels and used companies of the highest standing. The investment account moneys were invested in Penncastle, a ceramics company in Shanagarry, Cork.</P>
    <P>The various and only representations were from Deputy Quinn. All involved varying degrees of urgency and were received and dealt with in the urgent manner requested. The approval was <Col N="1365" /> given by the Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and the passport was issued on 2 November 1994.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme a reputable American businessman and his wife had two investment accounts in ICC in 1991 with the intention of obtaining an Irish passport. A third account was also opened which was a joint deposit account with Mr. Brian O'Carroll, an Irish businessman.</P>
    <P>In July 1993, Mr. O'Carroll transferred £10,524.59 from the account in ICC on which he had signing powers. I am assured by the account holder this was not an investment account.</P>
    <P>On being appointed party treasurer in 1993, I set about putting the party's finances in order and a fund-raising account was opened in Bank of Ireland, Baggot Street. The party was severely in debt at the time and one of the schemes we set up was a loan scheme whereby party workers were asked to donate funds to put party finances in order.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil head office printed forms on which individuals would enter name, address and amount and indicate whether the amount was a contribution or a loan. From general recollection without access to the records, the scheme raised approximately £300,000. The majority of this money was by way of direct contributions and the balance was by way of interest free loans. The loans were always repayable on request and the scheme was intended to run for three years.</P>
    <P>The entire party was involved in this scheme, including the national executive. Among other members of the national executive, Mr. Joe Brady was asked by Fianna Fáil headquarters to seek interest free loans in his constituency to help clear the party debt. One person he contacted was Brian O'Carroll. An interest free loan of £10,524.59 was received via Joe Brady, Roscommon, a member of the national executive finance committee, on 21 July 1993. The money was sent by credit transfer to a current account in the name of: Reynolds/Ahern at Bank of Ireland, Lower Baggot Street Branch, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>This account was opened by Fianna Fáil in early 1993. It was an ordinary fundraising account in the name of the party leader, trustees and the party treasurer. The account was opened in Bank of Ireland so that Fianna Fáil could build up a deposit of funds to enable it pay its loans and creditors. The account was in Bank of Ireland so the funds would be kept separate from the party's day-to-day operating accounts. Mr. O'Carroll had a joint account with the applicant.</P>
    <P>The joint account holders agreed to make a loan of £10,500 to Fianna Fáil. The money was transferred from their account in the ICC Bank into the Fianna Fáil fundraising account. The account from which the money was transferred was not an investment account. The official name on the Fianna Fáil account was Reynolds/Ahern. The interest free loan has not been repaid, nor has any request been made to repay it. I became responsible for authorising the issuing of moneys from this account, on presentation of demands, <Col N="1366" /> by party accountants when I became leader of the party in December, 1994.</P>
    <P>As to the people or institutions involved in this account it appears that nothing underhand, deceitful or criminal took place in the transfer of funds from the joint account to the Fianna Fáil account. All the persons involved acted with integrity, honesty and professionalism. Money was not diverted from any investment account into Fianna Fáil accounts. Statements that the money transferred to the Fianna Fáil account was the equivalent of putting IDA money into the account are without any basis. My programme manager categorically denies that he said the money was from an investment account. I did not have any knowledge of the transaction in question, nor would I have been reasonably expected to have had such knowledge. It was entirely a matter for the professional people employed to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I did not and do not hold any account in the ICC. I have not ever taken any money from an ICC or Fianna Fáil account unless properly authorised to do so for specific purposes.</P>
    <P>As regards the comments of Deputy Sargent. I do not believe I have ever done anything wrong concerning money in my 22 years in politics or prior to that. I would be honour-bound not to do so as a professional accountant. I hope I have not done so and I deem that I have not done so. I have not acted as an accountant for Fianna Fáil but only as a party treasurer. Being party treasurer does not mean that one checks every single detail. We pay people to do that but I take an active interest in ensuring that the party's accounts are audited quickly, that the trustees meet regularly and that the party fulfils its obligations. I endeavour to ensure that the party acts with honesty and integrity. My colleagues are of the highest standing. I have worked hard with them to introduce our own ethics code which will be finalised shortly. If I could get some co-operation from the House we could also get the ethics commission legislation through. I have been waiting for that for a year although the media blame me for not getting on with it. It is being sat on by a committee of the House. The committee should release it so we can introduce legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not nor have I been a beneficiary in any way of the ICC account. In particular, I wish to state that I never received moneys from this or any other so-called passport investment account. I never had anything to do with passport accounts, good, bad or indifferent, or off-shore accounts. The fact that the account was called Reynolds-Ahern was designed to nominate it as an official Fianna Fáil account, but certainly not a personal account referring to either of the two people named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly unhelpful that newspapers would use leaked material of an alleged nature to try to build up a head of political steam on this <Col N="1367" /> or other matters to damage this Government at any time, but particularly when we are endeavouring to get on with important Government matters such as the peace process and Agenda 2000. The tribunals must have a view on the legality, correctness, justice and principles of common decency regarding people who leak, publish and broadcast tit-bits of supposedly damaging information which clearly undermine the work of the tribunals.</P>
    <P>The House has given to the Moriarty and Flood tribunals the full authority and jurisdiction to deal in a comprehensive way with all these matters. The House should remind itself of its duties in leaving to the Moriarty and Flood tribunals the work it assigned to them and not seek to abrogate to itself the tasks we have already assigned to them. The tribunals, at the behest of this House, are the only places where the totality of these matters should be heard and decided upon.</P>
    <P>On many of these issues it appears people have information from outside the House but check matters inside the House. I did not know until the past number of hours that the details of 15 ICC accounts went to the tribunal. I assume others knew that information. I did not know until last night that this file and others went to the Moriarty tribunal. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assures me this one did. I am not making allegations. I will be fair about these matters even if nobody else in the House is fair about them.</P>
    <P>I could mention Deputy Quinn's name and go through all the letters. However, that is all tittle tattle also.

      <P>Geraldine Kennedy said the account into which the £10,000 was diverted seems to have been in the name of Fianna Fáil specifically, that money paid for passports is State funds and how could it be a political donation.

    <P>Another question was whether I had reported this issue to the Moriarty tribunal.

      <P>Responsibility for ensuring the safety of railway operations rests with Iarnród Éireann. Accordingly, it is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
      <P>There are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, as I have said previously my Department's railway inspecting officer has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann drawing its attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the increased capacity demands on this and other suburban lines, EU and Exchequer funding is being provided to purchase 20 diesel rail carriages at a total cost of £20 million. Of these, 12 are for use on the Maynooth line. The extra rail carriages will allow for three additional services on this line during morning and evening peak times.</P>
      <P>In addition the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth, the re-signalling of the line and the lengthening of the station platforms will facilitate additional train services and increase the passenger carrying capacity of the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7, 40 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Existing capacity of the Bord Gais Scotland-Dublin interconnector is sufficient to meet forecast gas demand until 2001. Bord Gais will enhance the capacity of the interconnector by 70 per cent by means of additional compression to be provided in the years 2000 and 2001. There will then be adequate capacity to meet forecast gas demand until 2004.</P>
      <P>A study of natural gas demand and related infrastructural options to the year 2025 is being conducted by Bord Gais and my Department and is already well advanced. A high priority continues to be given to the study.</P>
      <P>Technical consultants have recommended the provision of a second gas interconnector between Scotland and Dublin, parallel to the existing interconnector, as the optimal option. That option is being considered by Bord Gais and my Department against the background of a possible commercial gas discovery in the Corrib field off the west coast, the question of the provision of a North-South gas interconnector and a proposal by a company to construct a natural gas interconnector pipeline between Britain and Dublin, to be operational by October 2001.</P>
      <P>I have had recent discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the question of how best to address future gas needs for the whole island; I will be meeting with Dr. Mo Mowlam again within a few weeks to develop our ideas further.</P>
      <P>As previously advised to Deputy Durkan, the ESB, in consultation with my Department, published a statement of new generating capacity requirements up to the year 2005 in October 1998. This concluded that existing capacity together with plant in the pipeline, including the final phase of ESB's combined cycle gas plant at Poolbeg and the new Edenderry peat plant, will be broadly sufficient to meet demand to 2001. New capacity in excess of 200MW will be required in late 2001 or early 2002, and further new capacity in excess of 800MW will be needed by 2005.</P>
      <P>A number of private sector interests, including Viridian (formerly Northern Ireland Electricity)/CRH, Marathon, and IVO/Elf, are at present actively developing plans to enter the Irish market under the provisions of the electricity directive to be implemented here by 19 February 2000. The ESB is making similar plans for new plant, and I have recently given approval to the ESB for capital expenditure in the preparatory work up to completion of the planning permission process.</P>
      <P>Both the ESB and any private sector interests will, of course, require an authorisation to construct new plant from the new Commission for Electricity Regulation to be established in the near future. On the assumption that all necessary approvals are secured during 1999, I have every confidence that new gas-fired plant will be available, as required, by end 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy is to ensure the continued development of Cork Airport as an essential transport facility, serving the growing business and tourist needs of the south-east into the next millennium. A number of positive developments recently have underlined the success of this policy.</P>
      <P>Cork Airport has a strong growth record, with passenger numbers now growing at a double digit rate. Traffic grew by 10 per cent in 1998 and, already in 1999, January showed an 18.5 per cent increase over the corresponding month in the previous year. During 1998, two direct flights linking Cork with Amsterdam and Paris were introduced by Aer Lingus and a daily Cork to Belfast service was also reintroduced by Jersey European. I am confident that this trend in strong growth will continue at Cork into the coming year.</P>
      <P>Deputies may already be aware that Aer Rianta recently announced that, from 28 March next, Cork Airport will be open for 24 hours a day. This is a welcome development for the south-east region, as it is expected that up to 40 new jobs will be created and that new opportunities for further additional passenger and cargo traffic will arise from the airport's new status.</P>
      <P>In order to cope with increasing demands at the airport, capital development at Cork has proceeded apace, with Aer Rianta investing some £25 million over the last ten years. A £28 million development programme is planned for the five year period to the year 2002. Proposed projects include the overlay and widening of the runway and the provision of further airside and landside facilities, improvements which are designed to keep pace with traffic demands and to act as an incentive to new economic activity at the airport and in the Cork region generally.</P>
      <P>As a further traffic growth incentive, the generous five year discount scheme for airport charges continues to be available at Cork Airport, which means that any airline which increases it s passenger numbers on existing flights out of Cork in 1999 or commences new flights will not be liable to any airport charges for the next three years, and will enjoy a 50 per cent discount for a further two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the European Commission, at its meeting in Brussels yesterday, adopted a report on the ending of intra-EU duty free.</P>
      <P>The report resulted from a request by the European Council at the Vienna Summit in December last to examine, by March 1999, the problems which could arise with regard to employment and to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling the problems, including the possibility of a limited extension of the transition arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Commission's report. It is not, in my view, an adequate response to the clear request of the Vienna Council for a short-term extension of the transition arrangements for ending duty free. The Commission has made no proposal in this regard.</P>
      <P>The next step is for the Commission's report to be considered at the ECOFIN Council on March 15. If the Finance Ministers of all member states do not agree on a renewed request to the Commission at that meeting then it becomes a matter for the Heads of Government at the European Council in Berlin on 24/25 March.</P>
      <P>The Government has set out its view that a deferral of the abolition of duty free for five years is necessary to allow the industry adjust to the change. That position has already been supported by many member states, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. We will continue to lobby all the member states in the coming weeks to obtain their support for a specific request to the Commission to propose a limited extension of the duty free regime.</P>

      <P>The RPII has been in touch with BNFL with a view to arranging a visit to Sellafield to examine information and documentation being made available by BNFL concerning the safety of high level waste storage tanks at Sellafield. This visit will take place shortly and I will review the position when the institute has reported to me on the visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of the RPII visit I continue to seek the acceleration of the vitrification programme relating to high level waste stored at Sellafield. As the Deputy is aware vitrification is the safest form of storage of high level waste and I want the current backlog of such waste vitrified at the earliest opportunity. The institute's investigations of BNFL information held in Sellafield does not <Col N="1377" /> imply that I have softened my stance on this matter. I intend to raise the subject again when I meet Minister Meacher in London on 25 February next.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that the German Government announced in November last year that the nuclear share of Germany's energy supply would be gradually reduced and finally replaced and that this would be achieved by consensus talks with the nuclear industry and without any cost in claims for compensation arising.</P>
      <P>The ending of the use of nuclear power in Germany continues to be reviewed. Discussions on the matter took place in January with the French and British Governments and representatives of the German nuclear industry. The German Government have to take account of a number of issues, particularly in relation to the financial implications of terminating existing spent fuel reprocessing contracts with operators in Britain and France.</P>
      <P>At the end of January, the German Government decided to delay the introduction of draft legislation to amend German nuclear law to phase out nuclear power.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to monitor the situation and to report developments to me. It is not my intention, at this time, to arrange a meeting with the German authorities to discuss the matter.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 25 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Construction of the first light rail line from Tallaght-Abbey Street is expected to commence early next year. CIE is finalising firm budget estimates for this line to take account of the recommendations contained in the inspector's report on the public inquiry.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the extended light rail project approved by Government includes two lines: Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport. A preliminary estimate by CIE for the whole of this phase indicated a cost of £671 million. This estimate included provision for inflation and a substantial allowance for working capital requirements which would not normally be included in a capital cost estimate. When the necessary geotechnical work in respect of the underground section has been completed at the end of this year it will be possible to arrive at a more accurate estimate of the overall cost.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary finance is available to implement the approved project. Funding for the project in 1999 and subsequent years will be addressed as part of the normal budgetary process when the Government prepares its annual public capital programme. A sum of £20 million has been included in my Department's Estimates for light rail this year. The light rail project will also be submitted for EU assistance under the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion Funding.</P>
      <P>Arthur Andersen, consultants, who were appointed to advise my Department on a public-private partnership approach to the light rail project, are expected to submit their report early in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last May I published an indicative timetable for the extended light rail project. A copy of that timetable will be circulated in the Official Report. I am pleased to say that substantial progress has been made since I first published that timetable. I have approved CIE's application for a light railway order for the Tallaght line. The application for the Sandyford line was lodged on 14 December. Preliminary public consultation on <Col N="1379" /> route options for the Broadstone to Dublin Airport section commenced on 18 December and public consultation on the Abbey Street to Connolly Station section has commenced in the past week with the objective of making an application for a light railway order in August. The geotechnical consultancy on the underground section will start shortly and is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Light Rail Advisory Action Group has not reported any difficulties to me in relation to the Luas project. The main priority for the group is to ensure that the development of the expanded Luas network proceeds without delay in accordance with the indicative timetable. The group will report directly to me and its reports will be pub<Col N="1380" /> lished. I expect the first report from the group in the middle of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The planning and preparation process for the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann is making good progress in my Department.</P>
      <P>Subject to market conditions, the IPO is planned for around the middle of this year.</P>
      <P>I have set a number of very particular objectives for the Telecom Éireann IPO, as follows: to maximise the proceeds to be returned to the Exchequer; ensure a successful IPO; promote wider share ownership and ensure value for money on expenditure related to the sale.</P>
      <P>A steering committee chaired by my Department and also representing the Department of Finance and the company and assisted by advisers is meeting regularly to ensure that this major undertaking remains on track. They are working diligently on the many different and important tasks that need to be completed in the coming months. These include legal, management and business due diligence; preparation of the company business plan; preliminary valuation exercises; corporate governance issues; prospectus drafting; issues concerning overall size and structure of the IPO; preparations for research analyst presentations; banks syndicate structure; planning for the domestic retail offer; liaison with the strategic partner, the unions and the employee share ownership trust company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the key decisions relating to the IPO such as the overall size of the offer, the struc<Col N="1381" /> ture of the offer and the offer price will not be taken until much closer to the IPO date.</P>
    <P>At present, the State has an 80 per cent shareholding in Telecom Éireann, while the strategic partners, KPN/Telia, hold a 20 per cent stake which they acquired in 1996. KPN/Telia also have an option to acquire a further 15 per cent shareholding by the end of this year. In the context of the IPO, my Department is currently engaged in discussions with KNP/Telia in relation to their intentions regarding their 15 per cent option and in relation to other relevant matters in connection with the IPO. In March of last year, agreement was reached with the unions representing the employees in Telecom Éireann on an Employee Share Ownership Plan, ESOP, under which a 14.9 per cent shareholding will be transferred to an Employee Share Ownership Trust, ESOT. The current target date for implementation of the ESOP is end March 1999.</P>
    <P>I am also in discussion with the union coalition in Telecom Éireann on the issue of board composition.</P>
    <P>Under the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before this House, the State will be permitted to reduce its shareholding to a minority stake in the company and as I said earlier, the extent to which the State reduces its shareholding will be decided closer to the time of the IPO.</P>
    <P>As one of my key objectives for the IPO is to promote wider share ownership in the country, I can confirm that a significant dedicated tranche of the shares will be available for citizens. The Irish people have contributed much to the development and success of Telecom Éireann over the years and they are entitled to share in the benefits of that success by being given the opportunity to participate in the flotation. I cannot say at this stage what the precise size of the retail tranche will be as this will depend on a number of factors which will not be determined until much closer to the IPO date such as the overall size of the offer and the level of demand from both retail and institutional investors.</P>
    <P>A major advertising campaign is planned in the run up to the IPO to facilitate the general public in acquiring shares. At this stage, plans also allow for listing Telecom Éireann's shares on the Dublin, London and New York stock exchanges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my <Col N="1382" /> response to Question No. 19 on 10 December 1998 and to Question No. 107 yesterday.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of the chairman of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in relation to the introduction of a radon remediation grant scheme. However, as I mentioned in my reply to the above Dáil questions, there are no funds available for such a grant scheme in 1999. Furthermore, the question of funding such a scheme next year is not under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>I reiterate to the House that while the Government is not in a position to provide direct financial assistance to householders, every effort is being made to address the problem of high radon levels in dwellings. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's national radon survey, which has been ongoing since 1992, is due to be completed shortly. To date, the institute has published the results of this survey in respect of 24 counties. The results in respect of the remaining two counties, Mayo and Galway, are expected to be available in April. The survey, when completed, will give a comprehensive picture of the areas of the country regarded by the institute as being high radon areas. This survey has been complemented by recent radon preventative measures introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and local authorities in the form of technical guidance documents relating to the consolidated National Building Regulations, 1997. The guidance calls for radon protection measures to be taken in the construction of all new houses from 1 July 1998.</P>
      <P>The institute also carries out at the request of householders, and for a small fee, a radon measurement service. All householders whose homes have been identified under the institute's national survey or radon measurement service as having high radon levels have been so advised by the institute.</P>
      <P>The RPII has also initiated, at the request of the Minister for Education and Science, a survey of ground floor radon levels in respect of primary and secondary schools in Ireland. This survey, which commenced in September, will be carried out over the next three school years.</P>
      <P>The above approach is a measure of the Government's efforts to create an awareness of radon and to tackle the problem of high indoor radon levels in dwellings and schools.</P>

      <P>I received a copy of the report by the <Col N="1383" /> Wexford Council of Trades Unions on the Rosslare-Dublin rail link. I also discussed the line with a deputation from the south-east region of SIPTU. The question of providing additional funding for the upgrade of railway lines is currently being addressed in two ways.</P>
      <P>First, I am giving urgent and detailed consideration to the report of the high level task force on railway safety which was asked to prepare a report with prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the IRMS Review of Railway Safety in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The report includes a detailed five year safety implementation programme covering both infrastructure investment and improved safety management. I will bring the report and my proposals on it to Government at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Second, in the context of preparing Ireland's application for EU funding in the post-1999 period, my Department made an initial submission to the Department of Finance last June for aid for public transport projects. Upgrading of the Dublin-Rosslare line was included in this submission.</P>

      <P>An additional 150 buses are on order by Dublin Bus and it is hoped that the first of these will come into service from April next with the remainder coming on street by the end of 1999. If I were to specify that some or all of those new buses were to use alternative fuels Dublin Bus would have to commence a new tendering process which would delay both the date for the first deliveries and the overall schedule. There would also probably be cost implications which would reduce the number of buses to be purchased within a fixed Exchequer capital allocation for 1999. Given the existing critical traffic situation in Dublin and the pressing need to provide additional buses to expand peak hour services, I am of the view that neither course of action would be desirable at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of better air quality and a cleaner environment generally is primarily the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. However my Department strongly supports environmental improvement and I do appreciate the benefits to the environment of the use of cleaner alternative fuels such as LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas) or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). There are however a number of questions which would need to be examined, such as possible additional fuel and <Col N="1384" /> vehicle costs, additional infrastructure costs involved in new fuelling and storage facilities and safety considerations.</P>
    <P>My Department agreed to the establishment of an informal working group, with representatives drawn from both Departments, Dublin Bus, the Dublin Transportation Office, and Dublin Corporation's Office of the Director of Traffic to address these issues in the context of the ongoing bus replacement programme in Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Dublin Bus, in a joint venture with Bord Gáis Éireann, are currently operating, on a trial basis, a single-decker bus using CNG.</P>

      <P>The report was considered in the first instance by the high level task force on railway safety, established by the Government, to prepare a report with prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the Review of Railway Safety in Ireland carried out by IRMS.</P>
      <P>The task force submitted its report to me on Friday last and I am giving it urgent and detailed consideration. The report includes a detailed five year safety implementation programme covering both infrastructure investment and improved safety management. It also makes recommendations on appropriate arrangements for the funding of safety taking account of the property report and of the non-safety investment needs for the railway.</P>
      <P>I will bring the task force report and my proposals to Government at the earliest possible opportunity and make an appropriate announcement as soon as the Government has taken the relevant decision. Further consideration of the CIE property report will await the Government decision.</P>

The RPII's considered view, on the basis of the data derived from its own measurements of technetium-99 and other radionuclides present in seafood in the Irish Sea, is that the levels of radioactive contamination which prevail at present in the Irish Sea are now very low and do not constitute a significant health risk.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective is the cessation of all radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. I am determined to do everything possible to ensure that the positive commitments made by the UK in July last year at the OSPAR ministerial meeting on reducing radioactive discharges into the marine environment are fully and speedily achieved. I will be meeting Minister Meacher shortly to re-inforce the Government's views on these issues.</P>

      <P>The report, Implementing the Information Society in Ireland: An Action Plan, recently launched by the Taoiseach, allocates responsibilities and goals to Irish public bodies and timescales for the achievement of these goals. The report aims to ensure that Ireland exploits the benefits which the information age, and electronic commerce in particular, offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I will outline progress to date on a number of key goals allocated to my Department by the report, under the broad headings of infrastructure, legislation and markets.</P>
    <P>A task force chaired by my Department is currently negotiating the development of new high capacity telecommunications/electronic commerce links between Ireland and major commercial centres in Europe and the US through an alliance of State and private interests. The Minister for Finance announced the provision of IR£12 million in the budget to support this project which will dramatically enhance Ireland's international connectivity to global Internet networks. The project is well under way and our ultimate objective is to see this capacity come on stream in late 2000.</P>
    <P>Recognising that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required broadband infrastructural investment, I have recently made available European Union co-funding to projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services in these regions.</P>
    <P>Legislation to facilitate electronic transactions, covering the establishment of certification authorities and giving legal recognition to electronic signatures, is currently being drafted by my Department and will be published before the summer recess. This legislation will be based on the broad principles outlined in the document, Framework for a National Policy on Cryptography and Electronic Signatures, which was published last year.</P>
    <P>In addition a Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, which will provide for an upto-date and balanced regulatory regime in relation to the development of telecommunications infrastructure, is currently in preparation in my Department.</P>
    <P>The final decision on the contents of the Bill will be made in consultation with my Cabinet colleagues. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill during the current Dáil session.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming sale of Cablelink and the initial public offering of Telecom Éireann will help foster competition in the domestic telecommunications market. Electronic commerce requires cost competitive telecommunications services &ndash; this we believe is best achieved through competition.</P>

I will use this meeting with Minister Meacher to re-inforce the Government's concerns about the agency's proposed decisions. I will be asking Minister Meacher to rescind the agency's decision in regard to the MOX plant, and to substantially reduce the discharge authorisation limits, particularly as regards technetium-99, in keeping with the commitments given by the UK Ministers at the OSPAR meeting in Portugal last July.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> A specific panel of officials has not been established, as both Administrations are prepared to make officials available as required to assist the review. No fixed timeframe has been imposed on the process, nor have decisions been made on how the findings will be reported or published. The review will seek to focus on the questions which the inconclusive nature of the original accident investigation report of 1970 was unable to answer. In that regard, my officials are liaising with a group representing relatives of victims of the accident in order to take on board whatever questions that group may have.</P>
    <P>I cannot predict, however, how successful this review will be in shedding new light on these questions. My Department has always maintained that any persons who have new information or data on the cause of this accident should bring such material to the attention of my accident investigation officials and that remains the position during the course of this review.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta intends to develop a revised charging structure at State airports and <Col N="1389" /> engaged Price Waterhouse Coopers to assist. Their proposals are to be completed in March of this year and will be submitted for my approval.</P>
      <P>In considering any proposal in relation to airport charges, I will take all relevant factors into account, including the impact any change in the level of charges would have on airlines, and, consequently, on the travelling public. I will also have regard to the prospects of achieving a postponement of the loss of duty free sales within the European Union and to the pressing need to maintain intensive capital investment at Dublin airport, with a view to easing congestion. I will be open to hearing the views of interested parties on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Aer Rianta decided not to introduce a new cycle of discount schemes for air<Col N="1390" /> port charges at Dublin airport in 1999, and I am assured that the considerable benefits of the existing discount schemes will continue to apply until 2004. I believe this represents a prudent interim position for Aer Rianta, pending further decisions on airport charges by me in due course.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has informed me that there was no formal discount scheme at the State airports prior to 1994; a published growth incentive discount scheme was put in place by the company in that year. I append a table to this reply, as submitted to me by Aer Rianta, indicating the benefit arising from the company's discount schemes for each participating airline for the years 1994 to 1997. The figures provided by the company in respect of 1998 are provisional and may be subject to future adjustment.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 38 on 10 December 1998.</P>
      <P>The first peer review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety is due to take place in Vienna during the period 12-23 April, 1999. The meeting will consider the country reports produced by each contracting party which demonstrate how they are complying with the obligations of the convention.</P>
      <P>The peer review process allows for the submission by a contracting party of written queries on the country reports of other contracting parties. While country reports are not confidential, questions and comments communicated during the review of national reports are. The findings of the peer review process will be published.</P>
      <P>The Irish representative will have considerable flexibility to probe the UK delegation on matters of concern and in particular our delegate will have the opportunity to raise matters under the UK's legislative and regulatory framework and assessment and verification of safety. These aspects are dealt with under Articles 7 and 14 of the convention. Although Dounreay itself is not a nuclear power plant and as such is outside the convention's scope, the Deputy can be assured that our representative will be conscious of the Dounreay experience in pursuing these areas during the UK review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the provision of telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Recognising that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required broadband telecommunications infrastructural investment, I recently sought proposals for projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services which might be co-funded by European Union funding. Unfortunately no suitable proposals were received relating to Cavan or Monaghan.</P>
      <P>However, my Department, together with Forfás, is currently preparing estimates of further funding requirements to ensure nationwide broadband connectivity. All regions will be considered.</P>

It was entirely a matter for each individual concerned to consider his or her position and I left the matter with each of them.</P>
      <P>Four of them agreed to relinquish their positions while one decided to remain on the board.</P>

      <P>I met at their request representatives of Marathon, Northern Ireland Electricity and IVO/Elf on one occasion each as part of the ongoing consultation process relating to the implementation of EU Directive 96/92/EC on the completion of the internal market in electricity. I have also met various other parties including the board and management of ESB, the ESB group of unions and IBEC.</P>
      <P>My Department officials have met with a wide range of interests. I have appointed Mr. Phil Flynn as my special adviser in this important and complex area.</P>
      <P>Two public consultation documents were issued, in May 1997 and in May 1998, both of which attracted a significant degree of interest and comment. A public forum debate on the implementation of the directive, organised by my Department, took place in January 1998.</P>
      <P>Both Marathon and Northern Ireland Electricity have made submissions in response to the consultation documents. They are far too detailed to reproduce here but I am arranging to send the Deputy copies of their comments.</P>
      <P>I will endeavour to summarise the main requests made by potential independent power producers including those mentioned in the Deputy's question. In general, they have requested the early provision of relevant information, in particular in relation to connection and use of system charges and the electricity trading and settlement arrangements. On the latter issue, there has been no uniform request for a particular type of system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prospective entrants have also requested information on the regulatory regime and have also sought reassurance that they will be able to com<Col N="1395" /> pete on a fair basis. I have indicated to them that it is my intention to implement the directive in such a way that viable competition can take place for eligible customers in the 28 per cent segment of the market which is being opened initially, rising to 32 per cent in 2003.</P>

      <P>The Whiddy Island oil storage terminal is operated by Bantry Terminals Limited (BTL), a subsidiary company of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC). Following the installation of an £18 million single point mooring facility, and having obtained the necessary licences and permits, BTL returned the terminal to operational status early last year.</P>
      <P>In April 1998 two cargoes of crude oil amounting to 140,000 tonnes were landed at Whiddy on behalf of the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), augmenting the 205,000 tonnes of crude oil already held there as part of Ireland's strategic oil reserves. In addition, stocks of finished products are now held at the terminal on behalf of both INPC and NORA.</P>
      <P>The reactivation of the terminal offers the possibility of securing commercial storage business at Whiddy. BTL has already negotiated a number of commercial contracts with international oil companies. The addition of this commercial business brings the total volume of storage under contract to over 60 per cent of the terminal's one million tonne capacity.</P>
      <P>BTL's objective is to increase the customer base and bring the terminal up to full operating capacity. To this end, the company is currently pursuing a number of opportunities for further commercial contracts with good prospects of success.</P>

      <P>Further improvements will be possible once the city centre signalling project is completed. Had it been possible to complete this work in the pre 2000 programme it would have been included in the application for EU and Exchequer funding. However this was not possible for two reasons. First, there is a limit to the amount of work that can be carried out simultaneously given the need to maintain a reasonable level of suburban services during construction. Second, there is a substantial lead-in time for design and pre-planning work in relation to the city centre signalling project which meant it could not have been completed prior to 2000.</P>

The Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which passed all Stages in the Seanad in December last and is due to be introduced into the Dáil soon, is designed to deal with the issues highlighted by the institute.</P>

    <P>Under the Radiological Protection Act of 1991, the institute's licensing powers are restricted to ensuring that X-ray equipment is properly calibrated and maintained. The institute cannot take account of the competence of the personnel who operate the apparatus before granting a licence. The Bill to be debated in the Dáil soon will provide that the grant or retention of a licence for the use of X-ray apparatus will be subject to the <Col N="1399" /> applicant or holder meeting relevant competence requirements established for nuclear medicine and dentistry administered by the Medical and Dental Councils.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to the House on this issue on 10 December last, I set out in full the range of actions pursued by my colleagues in Government and I to have the proposed abolition of duty free facilities reconsidered. Our position is that there should be a deferral of the abolition of duty free for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, on 28 January, I addressed a symposium on duty free at the French National Assembly in Paris, and gave a very clear and <Col N="1403" /> strong message of support for the campaign to retain duty free. The Commission, which was represented at the symposium, was left in no doubt as to Ireland's, and many other member states', views as to the negative effects of abolition and of the widespread political opposition to its plans. I also stressed that this is no time for complacency and that it will be an uphill struggle to secure an extension for duty free. It is the Government's intention to work with all 15 member states to keep up the momentum for a reconsideration.</P>
    <P>When the matter was raised at the Vienna summit in December last, the European Council asked the Commission and the Finance Ministers to examine, by March 1999, the problems which could arise with regard to employment and to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling the problems, including the possibility of a limited extension of the transition arrangements. The European Commission, at its meeting in Brussels yesterday, adopted a report on the ending of intra-EU duty free. I am disappointed with the Commission's report. It is not, in my view, an adequate response to the clear request of the Vienna council for a short-term extension of the transition arrangements for ending duty free. The Commission has made no proposal in this regard. The next step is for the Commission's report to be considered at the ECOFIN Council on March 15. If the Finance Ministers of all member states do not agree on a renewed request to the Commission at that meeting then it becomes a matter for the Heads of Government at the European Council in Berlin on 24/25 March.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has set out its view that a deferral of the abolition of duty free for five years is necessary to allow the industry adjust to the change. That position has already been supported by many member states including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. We will continue to lobby all the member states in the coming weeks to obtain their support for a specific request to the Commission to propose a limited extension of the duty free regime.</P>
    <P>As regards discount schemes, Aer Rianta intends to develop a revised charging structure at the State airports and has engaged Price Waterhouse Coopers to assist in that task. Their proposals are expected to be completed in March of this year and will be submitted to me for my approval.</P>
    <P>In my consideration of any proposal in relation to airport charges, I will take all relevant factors into account, including the impact any change in the level of charges would have on airlines, and, consequently, on the travelling public. I will also have regard to the impact of any change in EU policy on duty free. As always, I will take into account the views of interested parties before reaching a final decision on airport charges.</P>

      <P>The recent progress on the Dublin light rail project is as outlined in my press statement of 29 January. I attach a copy for the information of the Deputy. It includes an indicative timetable for the various stages of the project. The timetable is subject to the satisfactory completion of the relevant statutory processes and technical evaluations.</P>
      <P>Since the issue of the statement public consultation has commenced on the Abbey Street to Connolly section in the past week. My press statement is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, today announced that she has approved the application by CIE for a light railway order in respect of the Tallaght to Abbey Street line. This paves the way for construction to commence early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the conditions proposed by the Inspector in his report on the public inquiry into the application. The draft light railway order is now being revised to reflect this decision and will be signed by the <Col N="1405" /> Minister shortly. In making her decision the Minister expressed her gratitude to Judge Sean O'Leary for the professional and thorough manner in which he carried out the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated: &ldquo;There has been significant progress on the light rail project since the Government decision of 5 May last year. I am pleased that progress is in line with the indicative timetable which was agreed at that time.</P>
    <P>When I announced the enlarged light rail project in May, 1998, some individuals claimed the project was being mothballed. Some even claimed it would never be built. Today's announcement underlines the Government's commitment to light rail and our determination to deliver the project on schedule,&rdquo; the Minister declared.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are on schedule and making significant progress right across the project, both on the southside and northside,&rdquo; the Minister said.</P>
    <P>The Minister also outlined other developments in the overall light rail project: CIE has submitted an application for a further light railway order in respect of the Sandyford to St Stephen's Green line on 14 December 1998 and Judge Sean O'Leary has been appointed to carry out the public inquiry into that application; a public consultation document, setting out the various route options for the light rail <Col N="1406" /> line from Broadstone to Ballymun and the Airport was launched on 18 December 1998; preliminary studies on the underground section from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone are due to commence within weeks; a public consultation document is about to be launched setting out the route options for the Abbey Street to Connolly Station line. An application for a light railway order for this line is due to be submitted at the end of August this year. This will again be followed by a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>In addition, Arthur Andersen who were appointed as lead consultants to advise on a public private partnership approach to the light rail project are due to report in the next few weeks.</P>

Indications are also given of the work programme in respect of the extension from St. Stephen's Green to Ballymun and Dublin Airport using the old Broadstone railway alignment and with an underground section in the city centre.

      <P>I have approved the application by CIE for a light railway order and in doing so I accepted the conditions recommended by the inspector who held the public inquiry. The light railway order is now being amended to reflect my decision and I expect to be in a position to sign it formally shortly.</P>
      <P>The conditions include a requirement that, prior to the commencement of the demolition or occupation of any of the properties at numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 Arran Quay Terrace, CIE must submit a detailed scheme to me showing its proposals for the redevelopment of Arran Quay Terrace. These proposals are to include, <i>inter alia,</i> the outcome of any application for planning permission made in respect of the proposed reconstruction; details of any agreements with the residents of the terrace and details of the relocation of such residents within the area, if desired by the residents. No action in respect of the occupation of these properties or their demolition will take place prior to my approval of the foregoing plan or any amendment thereto which I may request. Furthermore, prior to the demolition of any property on the Arran Quay Terrace site, CIE is to submit to Dublin Corporation proposals relating to the protection of the amenities of the houses backing onto Arran Quay Terrace at Coke Lane with a view to concluding an agreement with Dublin Corporation. In default of agreement between CIE and Dublin Corporation this matter will be determined by me.</P>
      <P>When the inspector's report was received, copies were sent at my request to each of the residents in Arran Quay Terrace. There has not, I understand, been any formal contact since then between CIE and Arran Quay Terrace residents. This is understandable pending signature of the order. However once the order is signed CIE will be in touch directly with the residents.

The Government's primary objective is to ensure that the telecommunications sector develops in a manner that ensures the availability in Ireland of internationally competitive communications' services and infrastructure. Government action in this regard includes the introduction of full competition in the telecommunications market from 1 December 1998; establishing of an independent Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to ensure full and fair competition in the telecommunications market; the sale of Cablelink and the initial public offering of Telecom Eireann; the introduction of primary legislation to promote infrastructural development; establishing the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications, with experts of international repute, which reported to Government in December advising on how to position Ireland to capitalise on the electronic commerce opportunities; signing of a US-Ireland Joint Communiqué on Electronic Commerce which identifies shared principles and points of common interest held by Ireland and the US in relation to the development of electronic commerce; the publication of a Framework for a National Policy on Cryptography and Electronic Signatures; a Bill on electronic signatures is currently being worked on in my Department and it should be published later this year; the development of a proposal to establish a public private partnership to enhance Ireland's international connectivity to global telecommunications' networks; seeking proposals to deploy EU structural funding to develop advanced communications' networks; developing a proposal to establish a North-South Digital Corridor between Belfast and Dublin which would complement existing infrastructural investments in high speed rail and road transport between the two cities; pressing for low cost internet access for Irish businesses and consumers to bring us into line with other countries with an established Internet presence; and developing a policy approach to the introduction of digital broadcasting in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Specific arrangements are in place in relation to the co-ordination of transport in Dublin and Cork. The Dublin Transportation Office is the statutory body charged with the co-ordination of transport in the greater Dublin area in the context of the integrated transportation strategy prepared by the DTI. The local authorities and the CIE operating companies in the Cork area have long-standing co-ordination arrangements which had their genesis in the Land Use and Transportation Study (LUTS) first published in the late 1970s.</P>
      <P>There has also been ongoing co-ordination of transportation investment through the medium of the Operational Programme for Peripherality 1989-93 and the current Operational Programme for Transport 1994-9. These programmes provided for a co-ordinated investment strategy involving the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as lead Department, my Department and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. This co-ordinated approach to investment will continue in the preparatory phase for the new national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted two ten month special beef premium applications on 3 December 1997, one in respect of five animals and one in respect of eight animals. Article 4(G) <Col N="1413" /> of Council Regulation (EEC) NO. 2066/92 states, <i>inter alia</i>, that the total number of animals qualifying for special beef premium is limited by the application of a stocking density on the holding.</P>
      <P>The stocking density limit for 1997 was two livestock units per hectare and based on the declared forage area of 11.83 hectares the person concerned was entitled to qualify for premia on 23.66 LUs. He applied for premium on 168 ewes which amounted to 25.2 LUs, that is 168 multiplied by 15 LUs.

      <P>Subsequent to the lodgement of his application form, this applicant contacted the area aid unit to state that the application form submitted by him did not reflect the total area of land he wished to claim. After further examination of the application in question it was accepted that the applicant wished to claim the same area of land as he claimed in 1997. Following the processing of the applicants revised claim, an overclaim of greater than 20 per cent was determined.</P>
      <P>The area aid application of the person named has now been finalised with a penalty being applied to the forage area. The result of the overclaim is a 100 per cent penalty on all area aid based payments in 1998.</P>

      <P>Under section 4 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the provision of educational and training services in agriculture. In conformity with this provision, Exchequer funding for these services is channelled through Teagasc. Accordingly, the provision of maintenance grants to the private colleges is a matter for Teagasc to consider when deciding on the allocation of its financial resources. I understand that Teagasc has recently decided to allocate £90,000 to the private colleges in 1999 to carry out certain essential works.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has also made a submission to my Department seeking funding over a five year period to meet the capital development needs of all the agricultural training facilities, including the private colleges. However, as these needs will be influenced by the level of future demand for training, Teagasc has, at my request, commissioned a study to establish the likely level of such demand. I propose to await the outcome of this study, which is expected to be completed within a matter of months, before making a final decision on the funding proposals.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a motion calling on the Government to outlaw fox hunting was tabled at a meeting of Mullingar Town Commissioners on 15 December last. As I indicated previously, I am not disposed to banning fox hunting. From a welfare perspective, however, there are practices associated with this activity which caused me concern. I conveyed this concern to the bodies which represent organised fox hunting in Ireland. I am accordingly pleased to note that the Irish Hunting Association, which encompasses such bodies, announced in August last rules and procedures which apply in particular to the practices of digging out, bolting and earthstopping. I regard this as a positive development and I have welcomed the fact that the fox hunting bodies have responded to my expressed concern in relation to such practices.</P>
      <P>The rules and procedures apply to all hunts which are members of the affiliated bodies of the Irish Hunting Association. These include the Irish Masters of Foxhounds Association, the Irish Foot Harriers Association and the Irish Masters of Harriers Association. I have received specific written assurances on behalf of each of these bodies that they are committed to ensuring compliance with the enforcement of these measures and to imposing severe sanctions on anyone found not to have complied with them. I accept these assurances as having been given in good faith and have made clear the importance which I attach to ensuring that there is indeed full compliance by all concerned. I would expect that these rules and procedures are being observed during the current season by all members of the Irish Hunting Association.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the concerns of consumers in relation to genetically engineered food. My Department is the competent authority in Ireland for EU legislation pertaining to the genetic modification of foodstuffs. Regulation (EC) No 258/97 came into force in all member states on 15 May 1997. This regulation applies to the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients. Food and food ingredients which have not, as of 15 May 1997, been used to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia</i>, within its scope. The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must be officially approved or <Col N="1420" /> authorised before being placed on the European market. The regulation also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 concerning the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms ensures that the provisions of Regulation 258/97 apply to foods and food ingredients consisting of or derived from GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation 258/97. These controls provide protection to consumers and I am keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland's Scientific Committee has established a GMO and Novel Foods Sub-Committee which serves to advise me on issues in this area together with affording a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food.</P>
      <P>Last August, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published a consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment. The purposes of this consultation paper were to explain the regulatory process, identify key issues of concern and establish the views of all interested parties. The public consultation process is still under way and I await the outcome with interest.</P>

      <P>Infant mortality relates to deaths in the first year of life. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths in the first year of life per 1,000 live births. The principal causes of infant mortality <Col N="1422" /> include prematurity, low birth weight, infections, congenital abnormalities i.e. defects present at birth and sudden infant death syndrome or cot death. Infant mortality is affected by complex and multiple factors. It is recognised internationally that one of the major determinants of infant mortality is social and economic circumstances. The infant mortality rates in respect of Cork County Borough (Cork City) and the country as a whole, for the years 1992 to 1997 are:&ndash;</P>

    <P>The figures for infant mortality for the Southern Health Board areas of Cork County Borough (Cork City) have been examined by the Southern Health Board going back to 1987. From this examination the Cork City area appears to have had higher infant mortality rates than the national average. However, in 1997, the infant mortality rate for Cork City dropped to 4.6 per <Col N="1423" /> 1000 which is below the national average of 6.2 per 1000. The Cork City area also has higher levels of low birth weight babies &ndash; a risk factor in itself for infant mortality.</P>
    <P>While well developed health services are important in this regard, of even greater significance is to address the associated social and economic factors such as poverty, nutrition and smoking, all of which contribute to poorer health status and consequently higher infant mortality. The Southern Health Board has examined the trends in infant mortality rates and is currently conducting a more detailed investigation into the deaths in question. In particular, the board is <Col N="1424" /> examining the cause of each infant death. I understand from the Southern Health Board that the first phase of this investigation is now nearing completion and I look forward to receiving the outcome of this study in due course.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems (such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck). To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people (aged 65 or over) must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves. As indicated in my reply of 3 February 1999 to Parliamentary Question No. 144 raised by the Deputy, as the person referred to in the Deputy's question is living with her daughter, she does not qualify for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>Consultation with customers is an integral part of my Department's work and the Department's customer action plan includes targets in relation to customer consultation for each service area of the Department. The objective of the consultation process is to ensure that services and supports continue to be delivered in a way which is responsive to the needs of customers and to obtain the views of customers in relation to future planned developments in this area.</P>
      <P>Customer consultation takes place through customer surveys; customer panels where customers meet staff locally about issues of mutual concern; comment cards available in local offices; liaison with customer representative organisations and with the voluntary and community sectors. It is not possible to quantify the cost of such customer consultation which is carried out as part of the normal work of staff. From time to time the Department also commissions independent surveys of customers, and of the public generally, to assess the level of service and highlight areas where improvements might be made. The last such major survey was carried out in 1996 at a total cost of some £48,000. It is intended to undertake a further such survey later this year. Finally, an element of customer research may form part of studies which are commissioned on particular schemes or services operated by the Department. This element, while in most cases it would form a relatively minor part of the overall research, is also a valuable source of customer reaction.</P>
      <P>Consultation with customers will continue to have an integral role in the Department's drive for continuous improvement and in determining the future delivery of services.</P>

      <P>Santry Demesne was originally an area of scientific interest (ASI). When the procedures adopted in designating ASIs were found to be contrary to constitutional rights in the early 1990s the sites were subsequently subjected to a comprehensive review. In 1994 Santry Demesne was proposed for designation as a Natural Heritage Area (NHA). The original boundary of the proposed NHA was established on 5 December 1994 following a review of the site and this was advertised in the newspapers on 17 December 1994. Following a site visit in September 1997 it was decided that, as some land included in the site was not of conservation value, the boundary should be modified. This led to a reduction in the area of land included in the site from some 33 hectares to approximately 17 hectares.</P>
      <P>The areas removed from the proposed NHA include the following (a) hedgerow composed of mature trees lining a ditch, (b) overgrazed woodland, (c) an open stand of trees containing Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp, Populus alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, Pinus spp, Tilia cf. platyphyllos, Castanea sativa, Aesculus hippocastanum; also found here were Cynosurius cristatus. The area also included dense bramble, thickets, and saplings of Fraxinus and Crataegus monogyna growing through these. The ground flora is composed of rough grassland species which are not representative of woodland ground flora.</P>
      <P>It is considered that there was no scientific basis for the inclusion of those areas in the proposed NHA. I have arranged that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, will forward a map directly to the Deputy, indicating the area currently proposed for NHA designation. I propose to introduce an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976 at an early date which will provide powers for the designation and protection of NHAs.</P>

      <P>The following research on public opinion was undertaken by my Department in 1998. The expert working group on childcare commissioned a study entitled &ldquo;Consultation with Children and Parents&rdquo;. The expert working group felt that it was important to consider the needs of children and parents as part of the development of a national childcare strategy and this consultation focused on children in two rural and two urban childcare settings. The results of the consultation were circulated to all members of the expert working group to assist them in their deliberations. The cost of this consultation was £2,206.</P>

      <P>Teaching practice is not a paid activity in any institution and is viewed as training rather than employment. It is an integral part of the curriculum of the degree programmes in education and there is no special financial assistance available to students for this aspect of their course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> I would point out that the four year second-level teacher education programmes in the University of Limerick are approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Under the terms of that scheme, grant holders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as an integral part of their course may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of St. Joseph's national school, Halverstown, County Kildare on 30 September 1997 was 14 pupils with the result that the school is staffed in the current school year by a principal teacher only. The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to prioritise primary education in the allocation of resources. The programme specifically states that one-teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher. In the current school year, a total of 67 schools are operating as two-teacher units as a consequence of my supportive initiatives for one teacher schools. In the context of finalising staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1999-2000 school year, I can assure the Deputy that the Government will fully implement this promise and I intend making a further move in this respect in the coming school year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the work of Marie Clay in the reading recovery programme in New Zealand. The programme has made successful interventions with young children of about six years of age on an individual basis. The programme is intensive and expensive.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of research findings on the issue of appropriate preventative and support interventions in the education of children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. My Department has initiated a range of supports for these children that include personnel, financial and curricular supports for schools and classes.</P>
      <P>Financial supports include enhanced capitation for teaching and learning materials for designated schools, grants for teaching and learning materials for schools in the breaking the cycle project, grants for start-up equipment in early start centres and annual top-ups. My Department also provides grants for parental development so that parents can become involved in supporting their children's education generally and become involved as classroom supports in schools in the liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>Ex-quota teacher provision includes concessionary posts in many designated schools, remedial teachers, co-ordinators in groups of schools in the rural dimension of breaking the cycle, a 15:1 pupil-teacher ratio in junior classes in urban schools in breaking the cycle, support teachers and early start teachers and child care workers.</P>
      <P>Curricular provision for children from disadvantaged backgrounds is catered for in the inherent flexibility in the primary school curriculum which makes it amenable to a differentiated delivery to suit the needs of individuals and groups. Differentiation at second level is being addressed through changes in the junior and senior certificate provision and in the transition year programme.</P>
      <P>I am very aware that formal and informal assessment is a regular component of day-to-day activity in classrooms. In this way pupils' attainment is assessed and their needs are identified so that they can be met in appropriate ways.</P>

      <P>A critical aim of the curricular reforms within the second level school system is to enhance the relevance of programmes to emerging economic and social needs, to provide a range of choices which cater for the diverse needs, interests and abilities of the school population, and to encourage more young people to remain within the system to completion of senior cycle second level education. Within senior cycle, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programmes, now being followed by over 32,000 pupils, are designed to strengthen the vocational and technical dimension of curricula and to provide opportunities for experiential learning and the development of enterprise, critical thinking and analysis skills. For those who leave the system early with qualifications, Youthreach, provided jointly by FÁS and the vocational education committees in an out-of-school setting, provides an integrated programme of education, vocational training and work experience.</P>
      <P>At post leaving certificate level, the opportunities to pursue vocational training leading to national certification have increased dramatically in recent years, and there are now some 23,810 students on these programmes. Means-tested maintenance grants were introduced for PLC students for the first time in 1998.</P>
      <P>Under the vocational training opportunity scheme and the back to education allowance scheme, second chance education and vocational training is provided for adults over 21 who are at least six months unemployed. In addition, my Department has recently published a Green Paper: Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning which will be a focal point for extensive consultation and debate on the future development of the adult education sector in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the ongoing need for young people and adults in the workplace to continue to upgrade their skills in a climate of globalisation and rapid technological change. Educational institutions have a central role to play in this process in developing flexible responses to changing needs in partnership with industry and the community. In that context, my Department will be developing part-time options under the VTOS, Youthreach and PLC programmes on a pilot basis during 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation will also be published shortly on the development of a national qualifications framework. Key objectives in this area are to provide a forum for the ongoing partnership of education, training, and social partner interests, in setting national standards of achievement, for the estab<Col N="1434" /> lishment of formal progression pathways to higher levels of education and training, and for the development of mechanisms for the accreditation of prior learning and work-based experience. These developments are critical to forging a continuum of provision to support lifelong learning.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>My Department maintains ongoing liaison with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on a range of welfare, labour market and employment issues as part of the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy. In that context, a range of measures are in place to provide financial support towards the cost of educational participation. These include the provision of extra staff and resources to schools in disadvantaged areas, grants towards the cost of books and materials for needy pupils, the alleviation of examination fees in cases of hardship, the introduction of means-tested maintenance grants for PLC students, and substantial increases in recent years in the payment of grants towards the running costs and equipping of schools. This is supplemented by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs schemes for the payment of back to school clothing and footwear allowances, child benefit and family income supplements where applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996, which is designed to ensure that work does not put a young person's education at risk, minimum age limits are set for the employment of children (persons under 16) and young persons (persons aged 16 and 17). The Act sets rest intervals and maximum working hours and prohibits the employment of under 18s on late night work. Breaches of the Act may be <Col N="1435" /> brought to the attention of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment by an employee or other concerned person, or may come to notice through routine inspections carried out by that Department. A parent or guardian of a child may also make a complaint to a rights commissioner. An employer is obliged, under the Act to see a child or young person's birth certificate or other evidence of age, and to get the written permission of a parent or guardian before employing under 16's.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has sent details of the legislation to all post-primary schools, third level colleges, youth organisations, relevant trade unions and employer bodies, and a booklet covering the Act is available to members of the public. In addition, a monitoring group has been established by that Department to review the operation of the Act and advise on how it might be better implemented.</P>
    <P>Under an EU funded Youthstart initiative, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' skills work and youth (SWAY) programme is developing and disseminating a range of information to young people in schools, youth clubs and Youthreach centres designed to inform young people of the need for lifelong learning, the importance of a formal recognised qualification, the demands and rights in the workplace, and the role of trade unions. The programme is provided through a partnership of education, training, guidance, youth service, trade union and employer interests.</P>

      <P>The leaving certificate applied examination already has a workable and accountable system of continuous assessment. The programme is modular in nature. The examination is based on a credit system, with a maximum of 100 credits. For the present cohort these credits can be accumulated as follows: satisfactory completion of modules (based on completion of key assignments), 40 credits; credit for student tasks taken at four stages over the two year programme, 27 credits; and final examinations, 33 credits.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is assessment at many different stages over two years. The range of assessment modes also includes orals, aurals, and practical work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme has a workable and accountable assessment sys<Col N="1436" /> tem mainly based on the system which applies for the six or seven leaving certificate subjects usually taken by pupils who follow the programme. In addition the students are assessed in the three link modules &ndash; preparation for work, work experience and enterprise education &ndash; by means of assessment of a portfolio of course work over two years (60 per cent) and a terminal written examination (40 per cent).</P>
    <P>Many students take two to three technical leaving certificate subjects and these are assessed by means of practical or project examinations in addition to final written examinations. Examinations in Irish and in those modern languages studied involve oral, aural and written assessments.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning disability, including those with dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teacher posts in the primary system and 350 at second-level. There are 39 remedial teachers at primary level and seven at post-primary level in County Meath. I recently announced my decision to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second-level schools with effect from September 1999.</P>
      <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
      <P>In 1998 my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities (ACLD) to assist their administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major development in special education services under which all children, including those with dyslexia, are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides a free educational psychological service to all post-primary schools and to 15 primary schools in County Meath. The psychologists provide assessments and advice to teachers and parents in respect of students with specific learning disabilities. I recently announced my decision to proceed with the establishment of a national educational psychological service. <Col N="1438" /> Recruitment of additional psychologists to this service will begin shortly and it is envisaged that the service will be readily available to all schools within the next five years.</P>
    <P>In areas where my Department does not currently have an educational psychological service, parents may apply for an assessment to be carried out by the relevant health authority. I have noted the Deputy's comments in relation to the burden falling on parents who wish to have assessments carried out. I am arranging to have this matter raised with the health authorities to see what steps can be taken to alleviate this difficulty.</P>

      <P>Waterford Institute of Technology's initial proposal in this regard indicated that the existing campus lands were inadequate for future <Col N="1439" /> developments and particularly for outdoor student recreational facilities.

      <P>In the circumstances, on 5 June 1998, I gave the go-ahead for the acquisition of an additional 50 acres of lands by the institute. As the vendor was prepared to sell 170 acres of the property as a single lot only, I allowed the institute, as an exceptional matter, to acquire the entire lot subject to a feasibility study being undertaken of the 170 acre site to identify the 50 acres of lands to be retained; moneys received from the disposal of surplus lands being refunded to the Exchequer; freehold title to the lands being confirmed and full vacant possession being obtained.</P>
      <P>The total purchase price of the lands amounted to £2.45 million.

      <Col N="1440" /> The institute has agreed, for security and other reasons, that the property be handed over on a phased basis. The residence and 42 acres of adjoining lands are to be handed over immediately, and the vendors will remain in occupation of the balance under a license agreement granted by the institute for a specified period.</P>
    <P>Development proposals for these lands are dependent on the approval of the development plan for the main campus which is at present being examined in my Department; the findings of the feasibility study on the lands at Carrig- anore to establish the area most appropriate for meeting the institutes space requirements; the outcome of planning applications to the local authority for possible developments on the main site and these lands and also the results of the Department's normal economic studies relating to both developments to ensure that value for money will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The present position is that my Department is awaiting the submission of the feasibility study by the institute.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for my Department to forward two maps to the Deputy. One shows the location of the property in relation to the city and county, and the other is an outline of the property itself.</P>
