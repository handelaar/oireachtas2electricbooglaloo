      <Quest>if he will report on his recent meeting in Ireland with the Premier of Newfoundland, Mr. Brian Tobin</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Tobin and Mrs. Tobin, visited Ireland from 17 to 23 April. The main purpose of the premier's visit was to lead a business mission to Ireland. He was accompanied by his Ministers for Industry, Trade and Technology and Justice and Finance.</P>
      <P>The business mission took place pursuant to the memorandum of understanding concluded between the Government of Ireland and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1996. This memorandum of understanding was concluded during the period of office of the Administration headed by Deputy John Bruton, in recognition that this province of Canada has the highest proportion of people of Irish descent of any area of settlement world-wide, and because of the commonalties and the potential for mutual benefit for the two participants. The mission was organised by Ireland Business Partnerships, which were set up in Newfoundland by Premier Tobin to implement the Memorandum of Understanding. It was done in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, with considerable input from Enterprise Ireland. The mission, which also involved the St. John's Board of Trade, included a wide range of companies with a particular focus on information technology, environmental technologies, tourism and film-making. Pre-matching of companies had taken place so that each company had a tailored itinerary of focused meetings in pre-identified areas, in numerous locations around the country, including Galway, Waterford, Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hosted breakfast for the Premier and senior members of his delegation on Monday 19 April. <Col N="602" /> I reiterated to them the commitment I gave when I took office in 1997 to continue to progress the objectives of the Memorandum of Understanding. On Wednesday 21 April I hosted a State reception at Dublin Castle for the Premier, the visiting business delegation and those on the Irish side with whom they are now discussing or doing business. Prior to the reception the Premier and I signed a re&ndash;affirmation of the Memorandum of Understanding. A number of business deals and agreements between Irish companies and organisations and companies from Newfoundland and Labrador were also signed at that time. I am also informed that following on from the week-long intensive series of meetings between Newfoundland and Irish companies, a number of further significant agreements are likely to result to the benefit of both sides.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Premier, I undertook to support a strong reciprocal business mission to Newfoundland &ndash; probably later this year. It is envisaged that this mission will be led by the Minister of State with responsibility for International Trade, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
    <P>The feedback from the businesses participating in the delegation was very positive. Premier Tobin himself was delighted with the outcome of the Mission which he described as the most successful business mission by a Newfoundland and Labrador delegation to any destination ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there will be a reciprocal mission going to Newfoundland led by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. Is any work being done on possible co-operation between Ireland and Newfoundland regarding the development of our respective offshore oil and gas resources given the development of the Hibernia field off Newfoundland and similar developments off the west coast of Ireland? Are technological co-operation possibilities in this area being explored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The environmental technology people on the delegation had discussions with their Irish counterparts. I know there will be further contact and people who deal with this area will be on the Irish delegation. As a result of their vast experience and success with large offshore oil fields and lead and zinc mining in the Canadian provinces, the Canadian delegation was anxious to discuss this and it was mentioned to me on a number of occasions. They had private meetings on this matter while they were here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to explore the possibility of closer co-operation between Ireland and Newfoundland in the area of fish farming, given the serious depletion of natural fish stocks off Newfoundland? There is a need both here and there to develop fish farming so that there will be an alternative source of supply for our products, which are in great demand worldwide.</P>

      <P>I will raise that with the Minister of State. The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, has been to Newfoundland for discussions but I will also mention it to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.</P>

      <Quest>if he will publish the letters sent on 16 April by the Secretary to the Government to former Judges Hugh O'Flaherty and Cyril Kelly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the letters sent from the Secretary General to the Government to former Judges Hugh O'Flaherty and Cyril Kelly on Friday 16 April, 1999 were placed on public record by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his statement to the Dáil on 20 April, 1999. As I said in response to questions in the Dáil on the Sheedy case on 28 April, the letters are in the public domain. However, in order to be helpful, I arranged to have the letters laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and this has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government satisfied it had the right, as the Government, to write this letter in view of the fact that under Article 32.2.5º of the Constitution the only function attributed to the Government is that of informing the President of a decision already taken by the Oireachtas but that any decisions concerning impeachment are a matter for the Oireachtas and not the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to write the letters was taken at a Government meeting; the Attorney General was at the meeting. The Government believed it was correct to write the letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government considered, in retrospect, if it might have been better to have allowed the matter to be dealt with by motion in the Oireachtas whereby the judges concerned would have had an opportunity to answer questions in a constitutionally legitimate fashion rather than deal with it outside the Oireachtas as the Government did by letter? This has made it difficult for the judges to provide the explanations which they would, no doubt, have readily provided if the matter had been dealt with by motion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such consideration. At the time it was considered appropriate and proper for the Government to write to the former judges and that is the action which was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that all such matters must be judged by their results? The result of the course taken by the <Col N="604" /> Government is that the Oireachtas is experiencing great difficulty in getting the information which would probably have been readily available if the matter had been dealt with differently, by means of motion in Dáil Éireann. This would not have precluded any pension arrangements being made; it would simply have allowed the matter to be dealt with &ndash; I believe in accordance with the Constitution &ndash; by the Dáil and Seanad and not, as the Government has done, by Executive action which seems not to be envisaged in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter asked the two judges to state their positions. I do not see how it would have made any difference if it were done subsequently or in any other way, by motion of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not recall that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty has stated that he would have dealt with the matter if it had been dealt with by means of a motion? Therefore, the Taoiseach is incorrect in saying that the Government was merely asking the people concerned to state their positions. In specific terms, the Government asked them to resign. That resignation precluded any consideration of the matter in the House by means of motion which would have allowed to be considered the question of why these decisions were taken. It might also have meant that the House might not have sought the resignation of both judges &ndash; a different and acceptable outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter stated that the Government had decided at its meeting to forward the report of the Chief Justice to the Oireachtas Committee. It went on to say the Government would &ldquo;consider, at its meeting next Tuesday, proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, pursuant to Article 35.4.1 for your removal, on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report, amount to misbehaviour within the meaning of the said provision of the Constitution&rdquo;. The letter was telling the judges what would happen in the Oireachtas the following week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Government's letter stated that the Government had already made up its mind that the judges' behaviour amounted to misbehaviour within the meaning of the Constitution, that the Government had prejudged the issue and that was what was being stated in the letter? In so doing the Government prevented the judges from appearing in the House and giving answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see it in that way. Natural justice must apply and it would have been wrong not to inform the judges of the Government's action. Natural justice dictated that they <Col N="605" /> be informed of the Government's action and they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, did the Attorney General advise on the content and form of the letter and in his advice, did the Government debate whether it was appropriate for the Executive to take the action it took or if that was the prerogative of the Oireachtas, as set out in the Constitution? Second, in view of the fact that the Government appears to have acted unilaterally and to have pre-empted the powers of the Oireachtas, why did the Taoiseach not see fit to consult the leaders of the Opposition parties in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Government said in the letter is: &ldquo;I have been asked to advise you that the Government will consider at its meeting next Tuesday proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses.&rdquo;  The Government was pre-empting nothing. The letter was sent on Friday and the Government was stating that, at its meeting on the following Tuesday, it would consider resolutions for the consideration of both Houses.  That was the proper procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government believe that it pre-empted the role of the Oireachtas in this matter? While I am aware that it was unprecedented, why did the Government not formally consult the leaders of the Opposition parties since the Oireachtas is the body that would have initiated the sanction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the meeting I contacted Deputies Bruton and Quinn or their representatives to tell them precisely what the Government was doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was information, not consultation, which is slightly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letters indicated what the Government, not the Oireachtas, would do the following Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he could not tell us what was in the letters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the Government's intent in sending the letters? Was the purpose to ensure the judges would resign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose was to let the justices know what the Government would consider at its meeting the following week. That was in line with natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider, given that the decision was one for the Oireachtas, not the Government? It would have been more appropriate to allow the judges to present their case in the Oireachtas rather than <Col N="606" /> present them with a letter such as this which effectively had only one suggested conclusion. On reflection, will the Government agree &ndash; this is an issue that we need to look at for the future &ndash; that it might have been wiser to allow matters of this kind to be considered in the House rather than in a letter in view of the fact that the outcome of the Government's handling of the matter, however motivated, is that the House is having great difficulty in establishing a means of getting the information as to why one judge acted as he did? This is information that would have been readily and constitutionally available if the matter had been dealt with by motion rather than by letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letters indicated that the Government would consider tabling resolutions at its meeting the following Tuesday. If one follows Deputy Bruton's logic, we should have tabled the resolutions without informing the justices. That would not have been in line with natural justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach receive a reply in writing or through an intermediary from the former Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty or Mr. Justice Kelly? When is it proposed to publish the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary General to the Government did not receive a reply from Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty to the letter of 16 April. He tendered his resignation the following day. The Secretary General received a letter from the solicitors acting on behalf of Mr. Justice Kelly on 19 April asking which facts identified by the Chief Justice's report amounted to misbehaviour. In a separate letter Mr. Justice Kelly brought to the Government's attention the fact that he had reserved judgment in certain cases and had yet to deliver them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's justification of this letter on the grounds that natural justice had to be served, surely if the object was natural justice, a reply would have to have been issued by the Government to any request for information from Mr. Justice Kelly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a note to say there is a reply on this file, but I will check whether one was issued. He subsequently resigned. I do not have a note saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree his response to my question to the effect that he is not aware of any reply having been issued demolishes his own defence that it was considerations of natural justice which justified the course of action he took rather than the alternative of a motion of impeachment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree because Mr. Justice Kelly resigned almost immediately after sending the letter. A reply was not going to be much good to him, although he may have got a reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explore a little further the issue of natural justice. Surely if natural justice was the issue, the judges should have been invited to respond to the report of the Chief Justice which was sent to them? Does the Taoiseach accept it is far more likely that this letter would have been interpreted by the judges when received, as well as the lack of any such invitation to respond, as being a threat that something would happen the following Tuesday if they did not resign in the meantime and that, in effect, meant that they or anybody else did not have the opportunity to find out the full facts of this case and why they did what they did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said many times that Friday that the judges had the right to respond and be heard and to put their position, but they did not avail of that right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach say that a private letter, to which a reply looking for information was received in one case but which was not supplied, could possibly add up to natural justice given that justice is something which is supposed to be dealt with in public? It would have been better to have dealt with the matter in the House where the proceedings are public and where questions on why things were done could have been answered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the letter was sent to these eminent gentlemen, they knew what the <Col N="608" /> Government would consider the following Tuesday, a motion&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They knew because the letter said the Government would consider that on the Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They knew if a motion was tabled in the House they would have been able to respond. That was made absolutely clear. The motion would have been cleared by the Government and put to the House and they would have been able to come and put their case, but they did not; they resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair to say that they also knew that if the House moved on foot of a motion proposed by the Government such a motion, upon being passed and becoming a resolution, would result in both judges losing all emoluments and pension entitlements forthwith? Were they, therefore, engaged in dialogue and discussion leading to proposals, which we understand from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform remain proposals rather than commitments? At what stage, if they were confronted with the probability of a motion of impeachment becoming a resolution, consequent to which they would have lost all their pecuniary entitlements, were discussions entered into with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their behalf and understandings or proposals arrived at that pensions in the order of £40,000, £30,000 and £15,000 would commence forthwith?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was already put on the record by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he spoke in the House on 14 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that Mr. Justice Kelly did not reply to the letter, other than to look for information which he was not given, is it not the case that these negotiations effectively precluded a motion being considered in the House whereby the information being sought by the House would have been provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>No. For some reason Deputy Bruton is trying to twist around the situation, something which will not work. The fact is these good gentlemen were informed, in line with natural justice, that the Government would consider <Col N="609" /> putting down resolutions the following Tuesday. This would have allowed them, if they wished, to come to the House and state their case. They did not do so, but rather resigned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My address to the IMI national conference focused mainly on the need to upgrade our infrastructure, especially through the next national development plan; the importance of R&amp;D investment in the information age; and the need to continue development of the social partnership model at both national and workplace levels to meet the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
      <P>At the most recent plenary meeting of Partnership 2000, these and other topics were explored under the broad themes of enterprise, jobs and small business and modernising the public service. Among the key issues raised by the social partners were the need to address skills shortages and planning bottlenecks to facilitate the delivery of major projects; the desirability of further consultations before finalisation of the national development plan; the need for a more co-ordinated and fully integrated approach to promoting life-long learning; and the need to press ahead with regulatory reform.</P>
      <P>On planning bottlenecks, the meeting noted the priority being given to the preparation of a consolidated planning Bill and the assignment of additional staff to An Bord Pleanála. On skills shortages, the recent announcement of 5,400 extra high technology places and the launch of the FIT initiative were welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the national development plan, the meeting was advised of my intention, as I stated in my IMI address, to consult the social partners <Col N="610" /> over the coming weeks so that finalisation of the plan will reflect a broad agreement about the development needs of the economy and in so doing provide a further boost to the social partnership process. To that end, meetings with each of the four pillars, involving the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and myself, are currently being arranged.</P>
    <P>On regulatory reform, the meeting was informed that, as I indicated to the House last week, I expect to be in a position to put detailed proposals to my colleagues in Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Bruton's question on the Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment, the Departments concerned have been meeting the social partners. Arising from this, a standing committee, under the chairmanship of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been formed. Its main purpose is to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the extent to which active labour market measures under the present agreement have had a special focus on the long-term unemployed, particularly those 35 years of age or over.</P>
    <P>The most recent meeting of the standing committee took place on 27 April and a further two meetings are planned for 17 May and 9 June. The next meeting of the Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment will take place later this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that at the end of his speech to the IMI he stated the time being taken to establish public-private partnerships is far too long? If this is so, why has the Government decided to deal with the Luas project by means of a public-private partnership? Is it not a delaying tactic to prevent Luas going ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach not say the establishment of public-private partnerships take too long? The words he used were that the time being taken from drawing board to implementation is too long. Given that he is head of the Government, what is he doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not talking about the problems with public-private partnership, but about projects which have existed for years. I cited six such projects, none of which was a public-private partnership. As the Deputy knows, we are taking action. Unlike the previous Administration, we increased the capital programme by 28 per cent last year and by 30 per cent this year. We have established a unit on public-private partnerships and have identified projects worthy of being pro<Col N="611" /> gressed. We have an interdepartmental PPP advisory group and we are trying to progress some of the projects which should have been undertaken some time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast with previous Administrations and bearing in mind the experience of Members, does the Government see merit in debating the plan before it is finalised, or will it be presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> which will be sent to Brussels following a series of statements in the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be discussed, but it may be a little early because its preparation has not advanced much since the Berlin talks. I will raise it with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is being debated widely by the social partners throughout the country, why is it premature for us to debate it in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The local development and infrastructural issues are being debated by the social partners. A debate could take place but the Minister for Finance would not be in a position to offer much information at present. The plan must undergo the regional process before it is returned to him so that he can put it together. A debate at this stage would probably be too early, but if the Deputy wants one now before the Minister has prepared the plan, perhaps that would be a suitable time. On the last occasion it was debated near the end of its preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of serious shortages among certain categories of <Col N="612" /> workers, such as bus drivers and the nursing profession? What action is the Government taking to relieve these shortages, such as training the unemployed &ndash; approximately 7 per cent of the population &ndash; or encouraging the immigration of people with the required skills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of initiatives is being taken. The standing committee under paragraph 424 of Partnership 2000 works with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS and other organisations and the social partners to identify people who are long-term unemployed. It is now dealing with people over 35, interviewing them to see what skills they need and examining what has happened under the activation programme to try to assist them in gaining jobs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct there is a skills shortage in many areas. Through a series of initiatives the Minister for Education and Science has substantially increased the number of third level places. There is also the fast track information technology &ndash; FIT &ndash; scheme which is operated mainly by technology companies, FÁS and some Departments to train about 2,500 unemployed people for the technology industry and guarantee employment for those who sit the course. That is up and running and has proven extremely successful on the basis of pilot studies conducted last year. The initiative on the over-35s has also proven successful. Long-term unemployment has dropped from about 9 per cent to 4 per cent, but there are still a number of people who can benefit. Everyone on the register is being examined, but the standing committee is at the stage of dealing with those over 35.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's replies and his speech in Killarney on 23 April when he said that a number of projects shortlisted for public-private partnership funding would be announced shortly, will he indicate when they will be announced as it is now over two weeks since that speech was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach drawn the attention of the relevant Ministers to the National Competitiveness Council report which condemns the fact that 11 per cent of 16 year olds are not receiving any education and are out of the system? Does the Taoiseach agree that at a time when skills are so important it is a national scandal that still more than one in ten young people aged 16 do not attend school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a separate question on this. However, I read the competitiveness report. While participation in second level education is increasing continually, students are still dropping out of the system. With a number of schemes like Youthreach, the falling PTR and the fact that <Col N="613" /> there are resource teachers and other teachers in the education system, I hope they can achieve their stated aim to hold more than 90 per cent of the people concerned in the education system and provide training, courses and apprenticeships for the others because there are sufficient jobs available, particularly for young people who are coming on to the labour market.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach aware that, according to the Central Statistics Office, between 1987 and 1997 profits grew almost two and a half times faster than wage increases and that over the same period workers wages as a percentage of gross national product declined by 25 per cent, a figure unprecedented anywhere else in the industrialised world? Would he agree that in looking forward to future agreements workers are justified in believing, when they consider the past 11 years, that their wages were kept low while employers' profits were allowed to rip? Would he agree in that context that it is this discrepancy between wages and profits which has resulted in the dispute of the scaffolders, who are among the lowest paid workers in the construction industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Given that even the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> pointed to the contradiction between low wages in the construction industry and the price of houses, would the Taoiseach join in a call on the Construction Industry Federation to immediately enter serious talks with the scaffolders and to agree decent wages increases from the massive profits which its members have accumulated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach aware that there is great suffering and disruption because of the refusal of the CIF to talk to the scaffolders and to agree a decent wage increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to refer to an individual dispute but, as I said last week, the CIF raised the dispute at the recent meeting of the social partners. Its representatives spoke about the adverse effects on employment, investment, delays in work and competitiveness. While it would not be appropriate for me to get into the specifics of a dispute, I still hope that all the representatives of the scaffolders and the construction industry employers will use the means to achieve an agreed solution to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> In reply to the question, I do not agree with the Deputy. What happened in this country in the past ten years is that whereas 18 per cent of the people were unemployed &ndash; more than 325,000 people at one stage &ndash; 45,000 people had emigrated, there was negative growth of 2 per cent <Col N="614" /> and Ireland was at 60 per cent of the EU average. Now we are at 100 per cent of the EU average and people are getting an opportunity to work and be educated. There are far more people in third level education. There are 1.6 million people working as against 1 million at that time. Long-term unemployment has been halved. Unemployment has been reduced by one third. The Deputy's argument is based on the past. I do not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding that the scaffolders' dispute was discussed at the plenary session of Partnership 2000, the Minister should intervene in this important dispute as a matter of urgency and encourage the parties to come together with a view to resolving it.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that house prices now represent a definite barrier to re&ndash;entry into the Irish workforce? Since the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is intent on keeping the country safe from non-Irish immigrants, the only place towards which we can look to maintain growth rates is the stock of unemployed people. In that context, does the Taoiseach accept it is necessary to take specialised measures to deal with the training and re-training requirements of the unemployed? It is a dichotomy that at a time when we have an emerging skills shortage which threatens to halt growth rates in the economy, 199,300 people are still unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there are skills shortages in some areas, particularly high level ones, but I do not believe it is as bad as it is made out to be. People are receiving training and re-training through bodies such as CERT, FÁS and other private schemes and are taking up employment as a result. Employers are finding that the level of qualifications which they thought were necessary for some positions are not really required. Some people who have been unemployed for six or seven years are now gaining employment. Employers should look at the pool of long-term unemployed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveys show a substantial decrease in long-term unemployment from 9 per cent to 4 per cent. Our level of long-term unemployment has fallen more rapidly than anywhere else in the EU. However, more remains to be done; as long as <Col N="615" /> there is even one unemployed person, we should seek ways to train him or her.</P>
    <P>Good quality jobs are now available for which people are not trained. The schemes which have been implemented by the Partnership 2000 groupings and standing committees are certainly worthwhile. People are being interviewed individually and are being advised and trained. The more education a person has, the better chance he or she has of gaining employment. Some people think courses are not a good idea but people do get jobs at the end of them. We can further reduce unemployment levels. Irish people are returning to Ireland in great numbers and more and more employers in the high-tech and construction areas are chasing Irish people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a barrier in some locations, certainly in the greater Dublin area. However, I noticed recently that when Coca Cola advertised positions in their Ballina plant in an area in which they expected only 200 people to be available for work, some 4,500 people applied for 300 positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw a teaching position advertised recently which the employer foresaw a difficulty in filling. However, some 150 people applied for the job, 100 of whom applied from outside the country. People are returning to Ireland. However, we should continue to train and assist those who are currently unemployed to provide opportunities for them. That is happening; the efforts of the standing committee set up under paragraph 424 of Partnership 2000 are designed towards that and are particularly aimed at people who are 35 years of age and older. Records still show that the older people are and the longer they have been in receipt of long-term unemployment benefit, the harder it is for them to gain employment. That is also the case in the United States, Canada, Australia and elsewhere. Some employers say they cannot find people to fill vacancies but able bodied people up to 55 years of age and older are available and are capable of filling those vacancies. Not everyone needs to be 25 years of age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcome the action being taken to assist those who are currently long-term unemployed, does the Taoiseach accept, given the statistic cited by Deputy Bruton, that our real problem is that up to 11 per cent of 16 year olds are leaving second level education? While we may be dealing with those who are currently long-term unemployed, we are ignoring the future long-term unemployed if we do not address that statistic. Does the Taoiseach agree that part of the problem is that these children are being turned off the education system not at <Col N="616" /> second level but at primary level? All of us who represent Dublin recognise this. Will the Taoiseach initiate a total review of the factors for such a high percentage leaving prior to 16 years of age and the steps which can be taken to change the curriculum so that school and education mean something real to people who opt out and become the future long-term unemployed? Is our education system capable of dealing with children who find the current system unattractive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fewer people are leaving the education system than ever before. The figure was 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not much comfort to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I set up the Youthreach scheme in 1987, the figure for early school leaving was 30 per cent, but it is much smaller now. We lose potential labour when young people leave, there is no doubt about that. In the recent Education Bill, the Minister, Deputy Martin, identified that. To combat that, the PTR is being reduced, remedial and resource teachers are being provided and liaison teachers meet families, not just pupils, to encourage them and to promote education. Those are good ideas. When children leave, or do not find the curriculum compatible with their lives, they may take part in training workshops. These are nearly empty compared to this time five years ago. All those ideas are in place.</P>
      <P>Education is the best way out of unemployment. The more qualifications, skills or training people have, the better the chances they will have in the future. A range of measures such as the National Employment Action Plan, the Education Bill and resources being put into education are working. That is why the State now has 1.6 million people working and the unemployment figures are one third lower than they were six years ago. We must, however, keep working at it as long as there is unemployment. The European Social Fund and other State resources are used to work on that task but we must keep at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>All these ideas, while they may be in place, will not resolve the problem unless there is leadership. The only person who can give leadership in such a situation, because it cuts across every Department, is the Taoiseach. Will the Taoiseach prepare a plan which will co-ordinate the activities of all agencies and Departments to ensure the skills available to people can be used by them? It will not happen if it is left to various Departments to deal individually with these problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The over-riding priority of the Government remains the earliest possible implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. We are working closely with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to achieve this. In the year since the Agreement was concluded, we have seen considerable progress in the implementation process.</P>
      <P>The institutional, equality and human rights aspects of the Agreement were passed into law at Westminster last November. On 16 February, the Assembly approved the report of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the number and demarcation of Government Departments, which the Executive will oversee. On 8 March, four supplementary international agreements, providing for the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council, the six all-island implementation bodies, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council, were signed in Dublin by the Secretary of State and myself. These agreements were approved by, and the legislation arising from them was passed in, the Oireachtas and at Westminster later that week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> Work on the implementation of other aspects of the Agreement is also continuing. The Human Rights Commission is up and running in the North. The legislation to establish a human rights commission in this jurisdiction will be introduced in the current session of the Oireachtas. The Patten Commission on the future of policing, the Criminal Justice Review and the International Commission on Decommissioning are all continuing with their work.</P>
    <P>All the necessary provisions are, therefore, now in place for the institutions under the Agreement to go live once the current impasse over the formation of the Executive has been resolved. The Government has had in recent weeks, including yesterday, an intensive series of valuable bilateral, multilateral and round table meetings in Belfast with the political parties. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have also been in constant contact, including holding meetings in London with the main pro-Agreement parties. It is likely there will be further meetings at ministerial level this week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>As I have consistently emphasised, the key to resolving the current impasse lies in the building up of trust and confidence on all sides to enable people to take the steps that are needed. A solution can only be found if everyone demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to move from their present positions. I welcome, therefore, the growing level of direct contact and dialogue between the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin and am hopeful that these discussions can help in finding an agreed solution.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the pro-Agreement parties are totally committed to finding an honourable resolution of the impasse, leading to the early establishment of the executive. All are also anxious that we move forward sooner rather than later. That is equally the position of the two Governments. We simply cannot afford to allow matters drift toward the summer, with the potential for outside events to undermine support for the Agreement.</P>
    <P>No one underestimates the challenge we face in completing the implementation of the Agreement. I remain hopeful that, with determination and goodwill all round and building on the considerable progress already achieved, the outstanding difficulties can be successfully overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is disappointing and unacceptable that the bodies of missing persons is being used as a type of chess piece by the provisional movement to be introduced in some sort of hopeful way when it suits it and it wants good publicity and then put on the backburner? There is something particularly distasteful about this. Will the Minister join me in putting on the record his condemnation of this approach by the provisionals? Furthermore, will the Minister agree that whereas it is true that decommissioning is not a precondition in the <Col N="619" /> Good Friday Agreement, it is a condition? It is stated in the Agreement that by this time next year arms will have been decommissioned. Implicit in that is that the process for decommissioning will have commenced before now. Will the Minister outline the steps he is taking to make it clear to the provisional movement that this House and the people North and South who voted for the Agreement are clear in their minds that there is no place for the gun in politics and that we expect these weapons to be decommissioned as a condition, if not a precondition, in the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Deputy's view that there is no place for the gun in Irish politics. As has been said elsewhere, there cannot be an armed peace. As far as decommissioning is concerned, we accept, as the Deputy rightly points out, that there are no preconditions to decommissioning. The Agreement does not contain a precondition that there must be a start to decommissioning before Sinn Féin can take its place in the executive. Given the size of its mandate and under the terms of the Agreement, Sinn Féin is entitled, as the Deputy is aware, to two places in the executive. It is equally a reality &ndash; I believe I answered this question on a number of occasions in the House recently &ndash; that the UUP has been interpreting the Agreement in a different way. Its understanding is that participation by Sinn Féin in the executive requires a resolution to the decommissioning issue.</P>
      <P>This Government has to face and overcome two realities. We have got thus far by finding solutions with which all sides can live and we have to do the same in regard to the current impasse. I have always said that decommissioning has to happen and that there can be no place for weapons in a democratic and peaceful Ireland, as the Deputy pointed out. The issue now, however, is one of timing and interpretation &ndash; how we get from the present to a point where all the guns are gone and what must happen as we proceed along that route. I agree with Seamus Mallon on this issue that only an inclusive solution to the current difficulty will work and that it is only through the Agreement and its implementation that decommissioning will happen. It simply will not occur otherwise.</P>
      <P>In relation to what has been happening in the recent past, there have been visits by me and the Minister of State, with the Taoiseach, to Downing Street where most, if not all, of the pro-Agreement parties were present, visits by the Minister of State to Stormont over recent weeks&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best. I am appalled by the human tragedy inflicted on the population of Kosovo by the criminal and barbaric acts perpetrated by the Serb authorities. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates that more than 700,000 persons have either fled or been deported over the past six weeks from Kosovo into the neighbouring countries of Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro. The number of internally displaced could now be around 800,000. Practically the entire Albanian population of Kosovo is affected as the Belgrade authorities maintain their policy of depopulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am gravely concerned about the fate of those Kosovo Albanians remaining in Kosovo. There are reports of mass executions, individual arbitrary killings, the use of civilians as human shields, rapes, torture and other ill-treatment of civ<Col N="621" /> ilians. Refugees have also been killed as a result of military action, including by NATO.</P>
    <P>The arrival of such large numbers of refugees in the neighbouring countries risks not only overwhelming the humanitarian efforts to assist them, but also triggering political and economic destabilisation throughout the region. Added to this is the problem of providing humanitarian assistance, in terms of basic food and medical supplies, to those still inside Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The Government's position, and that of our EU partners, is very clear. At the last General Affairs Council on 26 April it was agreed that this policy of deportation and destruction of a people could not be allowed to succeed and that those who planned, authorised and executed it should be held personally accountable and brought to justice before the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague. The OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission and other international organisations are gathering evidence from refugees on behalf of the international tribunal. However, statistics on the scale of these crimes have not yet been made available.</P>
    <P>Maximum pressure from the international community on President Milosevic and his regime must be maintained. Within the EU, a number of measures to broaden and tighten existing EU sanctions have been agreed, together with a ban on the delivery of oil and oil products to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from member states. I assure the House that Ireland is strictly and fully implementing both these measures, and those decided by the UN Security Council, and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>As a result of the crisis in Kosovo, suffering and death is also being inflicted on the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole, including innocent civilians. The human cost and consequences of the policies of the Belgrade Government are unacceptable and further devastation and destruction must be avoided.</P>
    <P>Questions are also being asked about the efficacy of the NATO bombings. There are concerns about the high level of what is somewhat euphemistically described as &ldquo;collateral damage&rdquo;, including civilian deaths and damage to the Yugoslav economy. It seems incredible that just as international peace efforts are beginning to gather momentum, the Chinese embassy should have been hit. I am also concerned at the damage caused to a hospital in Nis and the use of cluster bombs against civilians. In light of recent developments, NATO should reconsider its strategy of bombing infrastructural targets and centres of population in Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>Human life and human rights must not be devalued. This is a dimension to which the UN Secretary General and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights have referred in recent statements. It was also at the heart of deliberations at the recent session of the UN Commission for Human Rights during which our views were made known.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> The overwhelming majority of the international community is agreed that a political solution is urgently needed. The primary imperative has to be the swift movement to negotiations and political dialogue. It is essential that the United Nations has a key role and also that Russia is involved. At the meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers in Bonn on 6 May, the basis for a political solution was agreed in the form of seven guiding principles. These build on the five principles identified earlier by the EU and the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>These principles are: the immediate and verifiable end of violence and repression in Kosovo; the withdrawal from Kosovo of military, police and paramilitary forces; the deployment in Kosovo of an effective international civil and security presence endorsed and adopted by the United Nations, capable of guaranteeing the achievement of the common objectives; the establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo to be decided by the Security Council of the United Nations to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all the inhabitants in Kosovo; the safe and free return of all refugees and displaced persons and unimpeded access to Kosovo by humanitarian aid organisations; a political process towards the establishment of an interim political framework agreement providing for substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries in the region the demilitarisation of the KLA and a comprehensive approach to the economic development and stabilisation of the crisis region.</P>
    <P>The G8 is preparing elements of a United Nations Security Council resolution and will draw up a plan of further concrete steps towards a political solution. I welcome this very positive development. However, the difficulties inherent in implementing these principles should not be underestimated. It is essential that the authority of the United Nations in dealing with this major international crisis should be restored and the Government will actively support these efforts. I also note as a step in the right direction the announcement yesterday by President Milosevic of a partial withdrawal of Serb security forces from Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Turning to Ireland's contribution to humanitarian assistance, the Government is conscious of the great humanitarian needs of the Kosovar refugees and the host families in the region. It has given £2.6 million in emergency assistance since the conflict in Kosovo began, including £2.4 million within the last month. The funding has been channelled through a number of Irish NGOs and UN organisations for their humanitarian programmes. In addition, the costs of bringing refugees to Ireland are being met by the Exchequer. It is estimated that these costs will amount to between £13 million and £14 million in 1999. <Col N="623" /> While the response of the international community to appeals for assistance by the UN and other humanitarian agencies has been generous, there is no doubt that further assistance will be required and we intend to respond positively.</P>
    <P>EU ministers recently approved the mobilisation of a further 250 million euros for the relief effort. Of this, 150 million euros has been earmarked for the European Community Humanitarian Office. This is in addition to the 32 million euros already disbursed in the region by ECHO on behalf of member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland has agreed to take up to 1,000 refugees and I am happy to report the arrival of the first group to Ireland last night. I congratulate all those who worked so hard to put arrangements in place to ensure a warm welcome. The Government is doing everything possible to help them adjust to their new environment. Preparations are well in hand for subsequent arrivals over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Next Monday EU Foreign Ministers will again consider how best the European Union can support efforts to bring about an early political solution, address the humanitarian crisis, and plan for regional reconstruction through a stability pact for south-east Europe. The Government will also be active in support of complementary activity through the United Nations and the OSCE. The challenge is no longer simply the achievement of our objectives for Kosovo &ndash; it is to ensure peace and stability in the entire Balkan region and to strengthen the international system which is facing its biggest challenge since the ending of the Cold War.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in expressing concern at the way in which we are now constrained in hearing ministerial replies to questions. I appreciate that this is an order of the House but it needs to be urgently addressed. It is unsatisfactory that a Minister is cut off in the middle of a reply to serious questions in the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tenor and tone of the Minister's reply in so far as he was able to give it. Perhaps he might add the remainder of the reply in a supplementary answer. Given that the bombing of Serbia has failed to protect the people of Kosovo, does the Minister agree that, at the very least, it is necessary for a pause in the bombing to enable efforts to achieve a diplomatic settlement gather momentum? Would he also agree that it is important that any diplomatic settlement which will inevitably emerge will not include immunity, or as we currently call it impunity, for any individual or official or unofficial forces, Serbian or otherwise, guilty of attacks on civilians?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to state a number of principles and will then return to the Deputy's reasonable supplementary question. The principles identified by the EU and the UN Secretary General, which answer part of the Deputy's ques<Col N="624" /> tion, are: the immediate and verifiable end of violence and repression in Kosovo; the withdrawal from Kosovo of military, police and paramilitary forces; the deployment in Kosovo of an effective international civil and security presence, endorsed and adopted by the United Nations and capable of guaranteeing the achievement of the common objectives; the establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo to be decided by the Security Council of the United Nations to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all the inhabitants in Kosovo; the safe and free return of all refugees and displaced persons and unimpeded access to Kosovo by humanitarian aid organisations; a political process towards the establishment of an interim political framework agreement providing for substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and other countries of the region, the demilitarisation of the KLA and a comprehensive approach to the economic development and stabilisation of the crisis region &ndash; effectively the stability pact proposed by the EU.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will set out Ireland's continuing efforts, particularly those on the humanitarian front. Next Monday, EU Foreign Ministers will again consider how best the EU can support the efforts identified by Deputy De Rossa to bring about an early political solution, address the humanitarian crisis and plan for regional reconstruction through a stability pact for south-east Europe.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the bombing end once and for all. I would like those in Belgrade to listen carefully to Mr. Chernomyrdin, the UN Secretary General and others. The difficulty is the mind, manner and demeanour of the individual with whom we are dealing. Mr. Milosevic does not appear to understand or appreciate the terrible obscenity he has created in Kosovo, the ongoing human misery he has created in other parts of his country and the extension of human misery which continues in Albania, Macedonian and Bosnia.</P>
      <P>I would like to see peace return but on the conditions outlined in my supplementary reply to Deputy De Rossa's question. As regards the Serb military machine and what has been happening in Kosovo, I hope the diplomacy will not include immunity from prosecution for those guilty of rape, killing or mass murder. Those responsible must be answerable at the bar of public opinion for the crimes and horrors they have committed.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister like to ease himself from between the rock and the hard place in which Government policy on this issue has been stuck? Will he confirm that, from 1 May 1999, the EU has the power to direct the Western European Union on the Petersberg Tasks which include those involving combat forces in crisis management on a case by case basis, particularly regarding enforcement? Will he agree that, in order for the bombing to stop, there has to be a <Col N="625" /> plan for an implementation enforcement force to go into Kosovo to ensure the safe return of refugees to their homes?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister raised this matter, or does he intend to raise it at the EU General Affairs Council? Does the EU intend to give any policy direction to the Western European Union regarding this matter? Given that the UN Secretary General has taken an initiative involving Mr. Carl Bildt and Russia is also taking an initiative involving Mr. Chernomyrdin, does the Minister agree that the inactivity of the EU, particularly the General Affairs Council, concerning a matter on its doorstep is scandalous? If the EU has not considered this matter, why not? Will he undertake to raise the issue of enforcement and the EU's direction at the meeting next Monday?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the position of the Government quite clear in this House on a number of occasions. It is our intention that, in the light of the current public debate and following the European elections, in which parties will no doubt take the opportunity to set out their approaches, Ireland will join Partnership for Peace in the second half of this year. Prior to joining, a decision in favour of participation in PfP would be submitted to this House for its approval and would make clear the nature and scope of our proposed participation in PfP. The nature and scope of our participation would be reflected in our national presentation document, which would be presented to NATO upon signature by Ireland of the PfP Framework Document of January 1994.</P>
      <P>Important preparatory steps have been under way. First, both the Taoiseach and I have opened up public debate on this issue. Second, the Government will soon publish an explanatory guide on PfP. Third, we have decisively clarified the legal and constitutional issues. A referendum on this matter is not required as PfP would not be in conflict with our neutrality, would have no implications for sovereignty and would not impose Treaty obligations. This is the view of the Attorney-General, whose conclusions in the matter I shared with Deputies in a letter of 8 April to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government, of which Deputy Mitchell was a member, took the view in their 1996 White Paper that membership of PfP does not involve membership of NATO, assumption of any mutual defence commitments or any commit<Col N="626" /> ment or obligation in relation to future membership of NATO. It is also clear from the 1996 White Paper that the then Government did not contemplate a referendum on PfP and foresaw participation in PfP being subject to parliamentary approval. The then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs of that Government, Deputy Spring, stated in Dáil Éireann on several occasions that there was &ldquo;neither a basis nor a need for a referendum on participation in PfP, which imposes no Treaty obligations of any sort, no mutual defence commitments and which has no implications for our policy of military neutrality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While each country's requirements are unique to that country, it is the case that none of the neutral states in PfP have felt either a constitutional or a political need for a referendum. This is so even in the case of Switzerland, a country with a constitutional basis to its neutrality and a strong tradition of holding referenda on many issues. Consultations with the NATO Secretariat concerning Ireland's participation in PfP will take place at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is the Minister in a position to indicate to the House what the presentation document is likely to contain in terms of the areas where we are likely to seek co-operation through Partnership for Peace? When will this presentation document be presented to the House for consideration? Will legislation be required in relation to joining Partnership for Peace? What is the timescale in the latter part of the year, which the Minister has already indicated will be the general timescale? Will he confirm that, on joining Partnership for Peace, Ireland will appoint an ambassador to NATO, just as all the other neutral countries and Switzerland, to which he has referred, have done? If that is the case, would the Minister see merit in appointing an ambassador to NATO now so that the concerns of this House about what is happening in Kosovo and in the Balkan region generally can be communicated directly and effectively to the Secretary General?</P>

      <P>Regarding the presentation of Partnership for Peace, let me reassure the House that in advance of any decisions the House will be consulted and there will be a full, open, transparent debate on the subject. On the question of time limits, my timetable is still in place and I envisage, all things being equal, that the programme will include the possibility of our making the applications that are necessary in or about September-October. In advance of that, we will have a debate in the Dáil to discuss all the issues. There is a legitimacy in the Deputy's point of view, and there is a concern out there about the lack of clarity as to Partnership for Peace and NATO.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The burden of debt on many developing countries is an urgent challenge to the entire international community. Excessive and unsustainable debt levels have severely hindered the development prospects of many countries and this is a burden which has been disproportionately borne by the poorest. I am deeply concerned about the effects of debt. I intend that Ireland should participate fully in international measures to tackle the debt crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries. Our policy has always been, and will continue to be, to provide development assistance in the form of grants rather than loans. <Col N="628" /> While Ireland is, therefore, not in a position to take a lead on the issue of debt cancellation, we strongly welcome those measures &ndash; either cancellation or rescheduling of debt &ndash; which have occurred. We also recognise that these measures have not proved sufficient.</P>
    <P>Our concern about the effects of the debt crisis led the Government in September of last year to agree to a comprehensive debt relief package committing funds of over £31 million to ease the debt burden on the heavily indebted poor countries. This comprises £9.5 million committed to debt relief in two of the priority countries for Irish Aid, Mozambique and Tanzania and £22 million to be given to multilateral debt alleviation, mainly through the joint World Bank-IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Country &ndash; HIPC &ndash; Initiative. The Government also adopted a number of principles to guide our future policy on the debt situation of developing countries, intended to make the debt issue central to our future aid strategy. These principles include a commitment to strongly encourage the international community to take a generous and flexible approach to debt alleviation. Ireland will continue to use every opportunity to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden on developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid programme is focused on poverty alleviation and addressing basic needs, including nutritional needs. We are strongly committed both to providing emergency food aid to those affected by natural and man-made disasters and to ensuring longer-term food security for all developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Ireland is working closely both with programme countries and with international bodies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Food Programme and International Fund for Agricultural Development to combat hunger in the developing world.</P>
    <P>While economic well-being is of course central to development, we cannot ignore the need to tackle injustice and misgovernment in the developing world. Human rights, good governance and the rule of law are all central considerations in the development process.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The problems of many least developed countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, remain overwhelming debt; marginalisation from global trade and financial flows; AIDS; depletion of natural resources; and the consequences of violent conflict in many countries. Ireland is committed to playing its full part in assisting least developed countries to address these challenges.</P>
    <P>In the negotiation of a new Lomé framework between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, we are strongly supporting a strengthened framework of co-operation, including total access to EU markets for virtually all products from least developed countries to be achieved as soon as possible after 2000.</P>
    <P>The current financing for development discussions at the UN will have an important bearing <Col N="629" /> on how the international community approaches the needs of developing countries over coming years. Equally, the forthcoming WTO Millennium Round will be of decisive importance in addressing the needs of the least developed in gaining access to world markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been closely committed to promoting justice in the developing countries. Support for human rights, democratisation and governance activities is fully integrated into the development programmes of the priority countries for Irish Aid, ensuring that all aspects of human rights form an essential part of the policy dialogue with partner countries. Irish Aid also funds activities carried out by NGOs and other bodies to promote human rights and democratisation in non-priority countries. Ireland has also consistently used multilateral fora such as the Commission on Human Rights to promote justice and help build a global partnership for human rights.</P>
    <P>The litmus test of our commitment towards the alleviation of poverty and injustice in the world in practical terms can be judged by our own ODA budget. On the basis of figures obtained from the 1998 OECD annual report for aid flows in 1997, Ireland, on the basis of its ODA to GNP ratio, ranks tenth out of 21 donors listed. On the basis of the latest figures available, Official Development Assistance &ndash; ODA &ndash; for 1999 will reach £171 million, the highest amount in the 25 years of the existence of an Irish aid programme. This amount will represent an estimated 0.33 per cent of GNP, up from 0.31 per cent in 1998. It is estimated that ODA will reach at least £186 million in the year 2000 and at least £213 million in 2001. Only seven years ago in 1992, ODA was a mere £40 million. There has, therefore, been over a four-fold increase in ODA in that seven year period and there will be in excess of a five-fold increase by 2001. No other donor country can claim such a rate of expansion in the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Will she agree that the multilateral budgeting that she has put in place is really a whitewash to make it appear that somehow we are taking seriously our objective of reaching 0.7 of 1 per cent of GNP, the European target, when that is not the case, and that the only way to take this seriously is to legislate for it and put it beyond the annual Estimates wrangle? Will the Minister of State agree it is time to do that because it is obscene that we continue to grow in wealth at the level we are growing and do not take our obligations seriously to the extent we should given the wealth we have? Does the Minister of State see merit in appointing a European debt commission to look at countries worldwide on a case by case basis where we regionally would be prepared to forgive debt in the hope that other regions might follow suit. I am not talking about forgiving debt in countries where there are dictators&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the ODA budget is a litmus test of our commitment to development co-operation. The Deputy is aware our aid budget was the subject of some discourse earlier this year. On the basis of figures obtained from the 1998 OECD annual report for aid flows in 1997, Ireland, on the basis of its ODA to GNP ratio, ranks tenth out of 21 donors listed.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the latest available figures, ODA for 1999 will reach £171 million, the highest amount in the 25 years of the existence of the Irish aid programme.

It is estimated that ODA, on the basis of the new agreed multi-annual budgeting, will reach at least £186 million in 2000 and at least £213 million in 2001. Only seven years ago, in 1992, ODA was a mere £40 million. There has, therefore, been more than a fourfold increase in ODA in that seven year period, and there will be in excess of a fivefold increase by 2001.

      <P>I understand there are four minutes for supplementary questions and answers. I would have finished if I had used my four minutes.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that, in the interests of transparency of expenditure in this area, a redesign of the layout of the Estimates would be beneficial? Does she agree, in particular, that religious orders and NGOs have given better belt for the buck &ndash; for want of a better term &ndash; than Government to government aid, particularly our aid of some very doubtful governments? Does she agree we should put a line in the Estimates showing the contribution made directly to religious bodies and NGOs, so that the House can monitor the money going directly to them?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree there is merit in the European Union examining the efforts of recipient countries to attain democracy and reform their societies and, on that basis, giving such countries priority consideration for debt forgiveness over dictatorships, where people seem to get away with putting the money in their back pockets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be an interesting experiment to examine the extent to which our overall ODA contributions could be <Col N="631" /> enhanced by adding in voluntary contributions by the public to various Irish NGOs and charities. It would be interesting to see the level of that resource, in terms of international development co-operation.</P>
      <P>There will, however, always be a need for a bilateral programme. We provide significant resources for our NGOs and international agencies for development co-operation and humanitarian assistance. It is a very important part of capacity building in the Third World that we have long-term development partnership programmes with key priority countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa; otherwise, we would just be dumping aid in a way which is not sustainable in the long-term. Our aim is to build the capacity of these partner governments and countries so they can become responsible for their own economic development. That is a major part of our planned approach to development co-operation.</P>
      <P>There is an international consensus that the debt alleviation measures introduced by the IMF and the World Bank have not gone deep enough and have not been as effective as they might have been. We are in agreement with recent proposals by the Canadians and Americans, and the Cologne initiative, to seek to reform those initiatives at European level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 94, 124 and 125 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned in his reply to the Priority Question, the Govern<Col N="632" /> ment has already given a total of £2.6 million in emergency assistance since the conflict in Kosovo began. Some £2.4 million of this was channelled through the Irish NGOs and UN agencies in the past month. While the response of the international community has been generous, we are conscious of the great humanitarian needs of the Kosovar refugees and of the host families in the region. The refugees and displaced people are living in camps or with host families. The latest estimates from the UNHCR on the number of displaced Kosovars indicate that 406,000 are in Albania, 230,900 are in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, 61,700 are in Montenegro and 17,600 are in Bosnia. This makes a total of 716,000 refugees. The conditions in the camps are unsustainable due to overcrowding, their location near the border, which raises security considerations, and the onset of summer weather, which can lead to a deterioration in sanitation and health conditions.</P>
    <P>The Government of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia is conscious of the sensitivity of receiving large numbers of refugees into a country with a volatile ethnic mix. In an effort to relieve the situation, Albania will accept 60,000 refugees who are already in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. In addition, the UNHCR has stepped up its emergency evacuation programme to countries outside the region, which, of course, includes Ireland. The first group of refugees arrived here last night and arrangements are being made to welcome further groups over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the crisis is having a huge negative impact on the economies of the region and the international community is examining ways to mitigate the effects on trade and socio-economic infrastructure in those countries. The EU fully recognises the dramatically increased burdens placed on these states and is determined to provide the necessary financial and economic support. Ireland, together with the other member states, is contributing financial support through the European Union and a new package of assistance, amounting to 250 million euros, was agreed in April by the Council of Ministers. This funding will be disbursed over a number of months.</P>
    <P>Irish Government funding which, as I said, is being channelled through the Irish NGOs and the UN agencies, goes both to the refugees and to local families and communities. It is clear that further substantial assistance will be required in the months ahead, whatever happens at a political level. Arrangements will have to be made for the winter, which is particularly harsh in the Balkans. In addition, there are 600,000 to 800,000 people still internally displaced in Kosovo, whose needs will have to be met. At the beginning of April, the consensus of international opinion, shared by the UNHCR was to focus assistance in the region itself. However, when conditions deteriorated in Macedonia, the UNHCR triggered an emergency evacuation programme, calling states to accept refugees and give them temporary protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The humanitarian agencies are constantly updating their appeals for assistance on the basis of assessed needs in a very uncertain and changing environment. While they are getting a positive response from the international community, it is clear more support will be needed in the coming weeks. The Government intends to play a full part in helping to meet these needs. I intend to visit the region very soon to see the situation in the camps and local communities and to assess the needs. I am in constant touch with the UNHCR. The conditions in the Macedonian camps, in particular, are causing grave concern. Tensions and frustrations due to overcrowding and reported complaints of heavy handed management of the camps by the Macedonian authorities, themselves overstretched, led to disturbances yesterday. Some 2,000 refugees a day have been evacuated to third countries in the past four days.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian effort will, no doubt, be discussed at the EU Development Council meeting on Friday, 21 May, when an updated report will be made to Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well on her visit to the region. It is appropriate that such a visit should take place. I hope a parliamentary delegation will be facilitated in visiting there soon. Senator Lanigan and I were chosen to go but it was not safe to do so at that time.</P>
      <P>How did the Government arrive at the figure of 1,000 refugees to be accepted into Ireland? On what basis was the number decided? I join the Minister of State in welcoming the first group of refugees here. How were the venues in Kerry and Cork chosen to locate this group? Was it that very few places offered? Were places contacted and asked to make facilities available? Why were Cork and Killarney chosen on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of 1,000 refugees was proffered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at a meeting of Justice Ministers on 7 April. At that time, some countries had not offered to take refugees. It was the view of many countries, and of the UNHCR, that we should not contemplate a mass evacuation programme. However, on 23 April the UNHCR, on the basis of a massive deterioration of conditions &ndash; in the Macedonian camps, in particular &ndash; decided to trigger an emergency evacuation programme.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has confirmed, that on the basis of our assessment of requirements as we continue to implement reception facilities and services for those 1,000 refugees over the coming weeks, we will remain open to a proposal to receive more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards why Kerry and Cork were chosen, since 23 April when the UNHCR asked us to start taking in refugees, an interdepartmental group of officials has been trying to identify, <Col N="634" /> inspect and prepare accommodation to receive the refugees. Locations have been chosen on the basis of availability, vacant possession, suitability for family groups of not less than 50 or 60 and compliance with fire safety regulations. The properties in Millstreet and Killarney were the first suitable ones ready according to the criteria we outlined.</P>
    <P>The next group, which will arrive on Thursday, will be located in Kildare barracks and in Baltinglass. Until a future assessment is made, every effort is being made to prepare accommodation in other centres around the country so that we can take up our quota of 1,000 refugees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. In that context, I suggest the statement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night was crass. The idea that Ireland is not in a position to take more than 1,000 refugees is an unhelpful and ungenerous approach to the problem. Albania, a country that is on its knees, is having to cope with up to 600,000 refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not, in a declaratory sense, put a limit on the number of refugees we will take in. We have stated we are willing to reassess the situation. All our efforts at present are going into providing appropriate reception facilities for the 1,000 refugees that will be flown here in the next couple of weeks. We cannot put a limit or a ceiling on the generosity of the Irish people in this regard, particularly when the situation in the camps in Macedonia is deteriorating daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in constant communication with the UNHCR and, on the basis of an ongoing assessment of requirements, we stand ready to take more refugees. There has been some misrepresentation of what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said. Inevitably, as the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for this humanitarian effort, I would have a different emphasis in this regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has his own preoccupations and his own views on the matter. I do not accept, however, that he was ruling out the acceptance of further refugees by the Government. I am sure there is no resistance and that there is full public support for a generous response to further requests from the UNHCR. Even in the absence of such requests, on the basis of my assessment of needs in the camps following my visit there, I <Col N="635" /> would be in a position, with the Minister, Deputy Andrews, to bring proposals to Cabinet in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted my home town of Baltinglass will be one of the centres to take some of the initial groups of refugees. A large number of army officers, perhaps between 30 and 50, have had experience in the Balkans in recent years. They have much expertise to offer. In view of that, will the Minister of State approach the Minister for Defence to determine if some of them could be seconded to assist the refugees to acclimatise in various centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the experience and expertise of army officers in logistical operations such as this. I have already secured the secondment of several army officers to the refugee agency to help with its operational needs. Several Government Departments and State agencies have been involved, working around the clock, and are co-operating very well to put this operation in place. That effort is ongoing. On Thursday, a new group of refugees will arrive and will be housed in the former army barracks in Kildare, and in Baltinglass. I hope to avail of the services of various army personnel in that matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the efforts of the Minister of State and the Minister in this matter. However, given the speed of response of some other countries and some of the delays that have been encountered &ndash; the Minister of State hinted at some of them in her interviews &ndash; is there a need for a more proactive approach on an ongoing basis to deal with these humanitarian disasters that, unfortunately, occur all too frequently? What do we need to do to ensure we can respond more speedily? For example, Norway has already taken 2,000 refugees.</P>

      <P>The main difficulty we encountered was identifying and inspecting appropriate accommodation which had vacant possession and complied with fire safety regulations. The specific needs of refugees are well known. They need to be kept in family groups and they need to have access to local services. They also need access to the management teams associated with them for the provision of trauma counselling, psychological services, education and training.</P>

    <P>Not every type of accommodation is suitable. We are making contact with a mix of private sector property owners and various churches with a view to making appropriate accommodation available. Some public property owned by the <Col N="636" /> Department of Defence is also being used. We may have to use mobile homes because they represent the fastest way of accommodating large numbers of people. It is a quicker route than refurbishing old, disused buildings.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in my earlier replies, the issue of duty free is a taxation matter which falls, in the first instance, within the remit of the ECOFIN Council and, therefore, of my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the Department of Foreign Affairs, including through its embassies in the capitals of other member states and the permanent representation to the European Union, has availed of appropriate opportunities to advance the case for a re-examination of the decision to abolish duty free. Several of our embassies have also been involved in assisting and facilitating industry representatives in establishing contacts in the other member states.</P>

      <P>On how many occasions has the issue of duty free throughout the European Union been addressed by the General Affairs Council? What position did the Minister take during those discussions? How many jobs does he estimate will be lost in Ireland as a result of the abolition of duty free? Why is it taking so long to resolve this matter? Does the Minister agree that being an island economy, Ireland will suffer disproportionately to other economies and that job losses here will be very significant? What is the Minister's best estimate? Does he see the abolition of duty free sales going ahead as a <i>fait accompli</i> or does he hold out realistic hope for it? When will the matter be finally decided, I hope, in favour of the retention of jobs here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued very strongly along the same lines as the Deputy on the proposed abolition of duty free sales within the European Community. I do not wish to mislead the Deputy regarding the number of times I raised this matter with the General Affairs Council but I can get him a note on the time or times I raised the matter in that forum.</P>
      <P>With regard to the duty free sales industry, Ireland has suggested potential job losses in Ireland as a result of the abolition of duty free sales, of the order of 11,000. The Department of Finance commissioned a KPMG consultants' report on the employment consequences of the abolition of duty free sales. This report was published by the Minister for Finance in March 1998 and he presented the results to his colleagues at the ECOFIN meeting in May 1998. The report concluded that the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales would not impact on employment levels overall but its impact was likely to be of a specific and local nature, mainly in the maritime sector. KPMG reported that not all the 466 jobs in the aviation sector would be at risk and few jobs would be lost by airlines. The total number of jobs reported as being at risk in the maritime sector is 700, a figure made up by Greek, British and Irish nationals. There will not be job losses in sea routes that continue. Indirect employment job losses were not considered. The budgetary impact of abolition was estimated as a Revenue gain in the region of £30 to £40 million.</P>
      <P>The duty free sales industry estimates the direct impact on employment across the EU as 50,000 directly affected jobs. However, the sector estimates that as many as 140,000 jobs may be indirectly affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tell the House, as he has not done so yet, if he sees the abolition of duty free sales going ahead, and if so, on what date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see duty free sales being abolished and if so, on what date? Why is there such a conflict between what the trade unions are saying about job losses and potential job losses and the results of the report the Minister read? Surely the number of people who will lose their jobs, given the amount of duty free products sold, is substantially higher than the figures the Minister has given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In March last year the Transport Council agreed on the initiative of the Minister for Public Enterprise to ask the EU Finance Ministers to have a study commissioned on the effects of the abolition of duty free sales. Last November the Commission published a paper identifying specific instruments available to member states to cope with the possible consequences of the abolition of duty free sales. This focuses on known EU rules and procedures and according to <Col N="638" /> the Department of Finance is &ldquo;of little relevance and no novelty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question as to whether duty free sales will cease or be abolished, the issue will be considered again by ECOFIN on 25 May. On the basis of discussions so far there seems no prospect that agreement can be reached on a further stay of execution for duty free sales. Any further discussion is therefore likely to focus on the Commission's communication.</P>
      <P>The Commission report was considered at the ECOFIN meeting of 15 March and France, Spain, the UK, Greece and Ireland expressed support for the Presidency proposal, while the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Denmark and Finland were opposed to it. The Council took note of the Commission's report and the industry was invited to examine the Commission submission and report back to ECOFIN. Duty free sales was not discussed at the European Council in Berlin on 24 and 25 March. It was referred to by the British Prime Minister at the informal meeting of heads of State or Government in Brussels on 14 April but there was no further discussion of the matter.</P>

      <P>What is the Minister's opinion as to whether duty free sales will be reprieved? Have any studies been done on the likely impact the abolition of duty free sales will have on the cost of travel between Ireland and the rest of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the answer to the Deputy's second question off the top of my head but if one is available I will communicate it to the Deputy. Regarding the possibility of the survival of duty free sales, according to the figures and substance of the replies I have, I would not be optimistic. However, that is only my opinion and perhaps there are people with a deeper knowledge of the subject with a more optimistic view.</P>

When such a contradiction occurs elsewhere, it is normal practice for the person to whose attention the contradiction has been drawn to come into the House to seek to clarify it. All <Col N="645" /> the Taoiseach has said so far is that a full reading of the text would not give one the impression that there is a contradiction, and that was said on his behalf last night.

The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has made the renewal of local government a priority issue since taking office. Indeed the Department was renamed the Department of the Environment and Local Government as a reflection of this commitment. The Minister is unavoidably tied up on other parliamentary business today, but I think all Members are aware of his longstanding commitment to local government which is very much mirrored by the Bill.</P>

    <P>The Bill seeks to give recognition to local government in the Constitution and so strengthen and enhance its democratic legitimacy as a funda<Col N="650" /> mental element in our system of democracy. It also recognises the role of local authorities in providing essential services and in supporting and promoting the development of local communities. Local authorities are the only bodies, other than the Dáil and the President, which are directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage. It is this uniqueness compared with all other public sector agencies which merits recognition in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is also very fitting that the referendum to accord such recognition will be held in the centenary year of local government. The local elections on 11 June 1999 will serve not only as the date on which the electorate will have the opportunity to elect 1,600 local authority members but also that on which we will move to safeguard the future of local government. Such recognition will give local government the boost it deserves and will bring our Constitution into line with our continental neighbours. The date 11 June will indeed be a red letter day, a symbol of our commitment to move ahead with the renewal of local government. However, it will also have a very clear practical effect in that in future local elections will be protected by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a good time to reflect on the significance of local government. We have come a long way from the fledgling county councils established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, which was described as 'virtually an unwanted gift to the Irish people'. County councils played their part in the emerging county loyalties which have become such a strong feature of our cultural identity spurred on by sporting and other commitments. Such intangible factors have served to underscore in a very real way the legitimacy of our current local government system &ndash; loyalty to county, town and city.</P>
    <P>Local government has seen tremendous change this century and has had to adapt and cope with this change both in bad times and in good. It has played an important role in modernising the State through the provision of infrastructure, such as water and waste water facilities, roads and bridges, and in providing almost one third of our housing stock. Local authorities have had to adapt not only to think in terms of these essential services but to facilitate and assist private development through proper planning and development, to promote the renewal of urban areas and to protect rural areas. They also promote the community interest generally and the cultural identity of their areas. Local authority operations affect each and every one of us every day of every week. Perhaps it is their everyday nature that obscures their true value, be it clear drinking water, street lighting, refuse disposal, the fire service or developments in areas such as the arts, libraries, parks and tourism support. We can be proud, but not complacent, of local authority achievements. All of us must be prepared to learn from past mistakes, be it at central or local level.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be involved in the programme for the renewal of local government which is now <Col N="651" /> taking place and of which this Bill forms a part. In this regard the Minister has several times acknowledged the work of former Ministers over recent years in moving forward with the development of local government. The programme of renewal now under way builds on that work. The Government's renewal programme is aimed at tackling several key areas to ensure our local government system will be able to face the challenges of the 21st century. The programme of local government renewal is aimed at putting local authorities at the heart of their communities, strengthening and widening the opportunities for participation in local government, enhancing the policy-making role of councillors and promoting a customer service approach and greater efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Renewal and reform cannot and will not take place without financial reform. That is why we made such efforts last year to bring the Local Government Act, 1998, to fruition. The local government fund has been in operation since January and will play a pivotal role in promoting accountable and cost-effective local democracy. The new system will deliver significant additional resources to local authorities. Moneys from the fund will be, as far as possible, made available to local authorities as general grants over which they have discretion as to their use. Therefore, it will largely be a matter for the authorities to decide how this extra money is to be spent and they will be accountable for their decisions to their local electorate.</P>
    <P>A range of other initiatives are also well under way to modernise management structures, improve financial management systems, provide more integrated local authority and public services with a pilot programme of one stop shops and in individual service areas. A major planning Bill will also be published this year.</P>
    <P>I like to think that this programme of renewal which is now being implemented and which will be underpinned later this year with a major local government Bill reflects both continuity and change: continuity in that a system of local government has endured for a century and has the capacity to flourish in the next century; in so far as the positive elements of our local government system which are good and strong are enabled to flourish, such as the close relationships between councillors and the public they serve and the dedication and commitment of councillors and staff; change to enable local authorities to develop further to provide better services for everyone, to reposition themselves with a central role rooted in their links with local communities, in their capabilities to engage with and support the local community, and to harness the dynamism, resources and commitment in society and to channel them in the interests of the common good at local level.</P>
    <P>The integration of local government and local development systems is a central feature of the <Col N="652" /> renewal programme. The recent task force report on the integration of the two systems charts the way forward not just for local government and local development but for the delivery of public services at county and city level. The proposed county and city development boards will be led by local government. In this process, councillors will have the opportunity to play a decisive role to bring about a more effective and inclusive era of local governance. This will bring together not only local government and local development but the State agencies, the social partners and the local community. Recruitment by local authorities of directors of community and enterprise who will support the new boards is under way and the boards will be provided for in the forthcoming Local Government Bill.</P>
    <P>The renewal programme will be underpinned by a major Local Government Bill which will consolidate and modernise local government law and implement a range of reforms. It aims to provide a modern statutory framework for local authorities so that they will have a sound context in which to work. The Bill will also strengthen and enhance the role of the elected member and promote the greater involvement of communities in local government. Work on the Local Government Bill is well in hand. Constitutional recognition will provide the clear context within which work on the Bill will be completed and it will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>Constitutional recognition for local government has been recommended by various reports and commentators over the years, including the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the Constitution Review Group and recently by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. It was also proposed by the previous Government. I am pleased, therefore, that on foot of this Bill the proposal will be put to the people by way of referendum on 11 June.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment, if carried by referendum, will insert an additional article &ndash; 28A &ndash; in the Constitution. Paragraph 1 of this new Article recognises the role of local government in providing a local democratic forum, in carrying out the wide range of functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiatives the interests of local communities. In effect, this recognises the principle of local government as envisaged in the European Charter of Local Self Government.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of Article 28A recognises the institutions of local government, the directly elected local authorities, the members of which will be elected on the day the referendum is held. It provides that local authorities are established by and operate subject to law.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 deals with local elections. Over the years local elections have been deferred at different times by different Governments, sometimes for lengthy periods. Such deferral has served to devalue our system of local government. Paragraph 3 will guarantee local elections will be held no later than the fifth year after the previous elec<Col N="653" /> tions were held. It will be no longer possible, by legislation therefore, to postpone local elections for lengthy periods . For example, this means the next elections after this year will be held in 2004 whereas we have had intervals of up to nine years in the past.</P>
    <P>The world has changed dramatically and, as the pace of change quickens, so must local government respond to meet the needs and aspirations of local communities. Local authorities must, in consultation with other relevant agencies, plan for and provide the essential infrastructure necessary to sustain our economic growth and protect our environment. They must also stimulate and support action to meet local needs and aspirations by engaging with and involving local communities in the process of local government, a central aim of the strategic policy committee system. Our objective is to ensure the system is perceived to make a difference and has a level of legitimacy and direct accountability which will reinforce its validity. The forthcoming Bill will also reflect these aims.</P>
    <P>We are on the cusp of the new millennium and there is no doubt but that it will bring considerable changes and advances to our lives. It is important, therefore, that our democratic institutions, especially local government, will be renewed to face these changes and to bring the public along with them. I am confident this programme of renewal, underpinned by legislation and reinforced by constitutional recognition, will more than adequately prepare local government for the challenges which lie ahead. I urge every voter to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the proposed amendment as set out in the Schedule to the Bill. If the Bill is passed by both Houses, that proposal will, in the words of Article 46 of the Constitution: &ldquo;...be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people...&rdquo; on 11 June this year. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill. As the Minister of State pointed out, this was a step proposed by the previous Government and I am glad to see it before us. It is proper that our system of local government should be specifically recognised in the Constitution and that is more relevant since, having listened to what the Minister and his colleagues have said, I believe we may be on the verge of long overdue development in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should find a way of phrasing the constitutional amendment to emphasise that, like our system of national government, our system of local government is one of representative democracy. In other words, we elect people to do certain things on our behalf within the confines of the Constitution and the law. That is an aspect of local government which unfortunately has tended to fade into the background. I hope we will change that and I am a little encouraged after hearing what the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said. He made some remarks about this in a different context at a <Col N="654" /> meeting of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government this afternoon. I would like to see it made clear in the text of the constitutional amendment to be put before the people that local government is a system of representative democracy and I will propose a suitable amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to make that clear.</P>
    <P>It is important we do it now because the Minister of State referred to two Bills we all await with great interest. One is the Local Government Bill, to which the Minister of State referred, and the other is a planning Bill. One is a general Bill to deal with structures, procedures and powers of local authorities and the other a more focused Bill to modernise our planning legislation. The Minister of State will not be surprised to hear me say that, in the context of each of those two Bills, I will seek with the support of my colleagues on this side of the House, to restore to the elected members of local authorities functions proper to people elected in a system of representative democracy.</P>
    <P>There are some indications we are in a slight muddle about this at present. Perhaps that is characteristic of a transition period because we undergoing some transitions in local government which I hope will produce results. So far, the scheme of strategic policy committees has yet to settle down. We will shortly go through the process of setting up county and city development boards. I know there are a number of rather knotty issues to be sorted out in the context of that work, but it is important to emphasise that we have a system of representative democracy. That is not to say we should not have close consultation with groups which represent various interests in our communities, give them a voice or assist them. It is important that we put the onus of responsibility for decision making on the people who are elected to do so. I hope there will be a large turn-out on 11 June when people will vote specifically to elect people to do things on their behalf. We should expand the scope of what those elected people may do on behalf of the people who elect them.</P>
    <P>The proposed constitutional amendment also deals with the frequency of elections. In general, I approve of the Government's proposal, although I have some hesitations about it. I have always believed it is unwise and undesirable to defer local elections. I say that in the knowledge that last year in the Chamber I suggested to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, that he need not worry about the reaction from this side of the House if he proposed to hold the local elections in 1999 rather than in 1998. I could see many advantages and a good deal of logic in aligning the date of the local elections with the date of the European elections.</P>
    <P>Why does the Government believe it must leave a window in the period from June to December up to the end of 2004 for the next local elections and for subsequent local elections? It is <Col N="655" /> not obvious to me why that should be so. The Government may have a reason which will clearly commend itself to us, but I want to know what it is.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the text of the proposed constitutional amendment to prevent this or a future Government from holding local elections earlier than five years after the date of the previous local elections. Again, the Government may have a reason for doing that, but it is certainly not obvious to me. It would be logical to state that local elections will be always held on the same day as the European elections. That would have the effect of providing, without any qualification, for a five year interval. I wonder why that is not being done. I doubt the Government wants to retain the option of having local elections sooner than five years after this year's elections, but the question arises from the way the text is drafted.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government not take this opportunity of having a constitutional referendum to align the age of qualification to be a candidate in a presidential election or general election with the age of qualification to vote. While this would involve an extra ballot paper for voters on 11 June, it would be an appropriate time to do it. As far as I know, there is a good deal of support in the House for that proposal. If my memory serves me correctly, there is a Private Members' Bill on the Order Paper to this effect which, of course, has not been reached due to the pressure of other business, but this is a good opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>Although I appreciate that some changes and improvements have been made to the operation of the local government system and more seem to be in prospect, I take the Minister's encomiums about the local government fund with more than a grain of salt. It is all very fine to state that as far as possible this local government fund will be disbursed in the form of general grants which allow local authorities to make up their own minds about how they spend the money. In reality, of course, the proportion of the local government fund which is available to local authorities in that way is rather limited and the proportion of the total funding which is available to them in the form of general grants, over which they have full discretion, is also rather limited. That is not entirely desirable.</P>
    <P>It is a happy coincidence that the local elections are taking place on the same day as the European elections. That serves to make a political point that there are different functions at different levels of government. It is no accident that many of the functions which are carried out by local authorities in all of the important environmental areas are carried out to apply the provisions of a great many EU directives at national level. It is important to recognise the important link between local government and European policy in its widest sense, which makes it more than symbolically important that these two elections are being held on the same day. However, it raises <Col N="656" /> the question of our commitment to the principle of subsidiarity. We are far from expressing that principle as clearly, widely or comprehensively as we might in the context of local government. As I said, that is one of the reasons I will be proposing an amendment to the text of the proposed constitutional amendment on Committee Stage, but it is also one of the reasons I am happy we are taking this step at this stage and making this amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party believes the principle of local democracy should be enshrined in the Constitution and that the system of local government should be underpinned by the Constitution. We also believe the intervals between local elections should be fixed at not more than five years. During the debate on the Local Government Bill, 1991, I recall seeking to have legislative provision made to that effect so that local elections could not be postponed in the way they have in the past. It is, therefore, with some regret that I say we cannot support the Bill and will oppose it on Second Stage. I have given this matter much consideration. There are a number of reasons for this stance. The first is one of principle which has to do with the way we treat the Constitution. It is not acceptable to put before the people an amendment to change the people's Constitution which is getting only the slightest consideration in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Second Stage will be debated for less than two hours this evening, to be followed by Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow morning which will be guillotined at lunch time. There will not be an interval between Committee and Report Stages; indeed, there will not be a separate Report Stage. The entire Bill will then be rushed through the Seanad and on to Áras an Uachtaráin before midnight tomorrow to be signed by the President in order that the amendment can be put before the people on 11 June. That is not the way to treat the Constitution. The people should not be presented with a proposal to change the Constitution which has received very little consideration and about which there has been little public debate.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the proposed wording of the amendment. The wording is ambiguous, particularly in the first two of the three sections of the proposed Article. The kindest thing that can be said about it is that it is meaningless; at worst, it may have the unwitting effect of undermining local democracy and government rather than strengthening it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just one month from now, on 11 June, the half of the electorate which will turn out to vote will be given three ballot papers, four in some cases. They will be given one for the European elections, one for the city or county council &ndash; in some cases a separate ballot paper will be issued for urban district councils or town commissions &ndash; and, if this Bill is passed, one on the proposal to amend the Constitution. This constitutional referendum will bewilder many voters. Some vot<Col N="657" /> ers will have heard little or nothing about it before polling day, many will not know what it is about and, once again, citizens who value their Constitution will resent the apparent attempt to change it with little or no advance notice and with hardly any public debate.</P>
    <P>We value our Constitution and are aware of its importance. We know it can only be changed by direct decision of the people and we know that any proposal to change the Constitution must be fully considered, explained and debated. The proposals put before this House by the Government today do not satisfy any of those conditions. The Bill, Second Stage of which is being debated today, was only published on 30 April with an interval between publication and Second Stage which does not even satisfy the accepted minimum two week interval for new legislation.</P>
    <P>The subject matter of this amendment may be one on which there is general political agreement. The Labour Party strongly supports the granting of constitutional recognition to local government; we particularly support the proposition that the Constitution should provide for a minimum five year interval between local elections. This requires the insertion of new text in our Constitution and we need more time to consider that text even if the underlying principles are generally agreed to.</P>
    <P>When the Minister first announced his intention to hold this referendum in conjunction with the local elections, I requested that Opposition parties would be consulted on the proposed wording prior to the Bill's publication. No such consultation occurred and the Bill and its wording are the product of the Government's unilateral thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>Following the Bill's publication, the Minister contacted me and offered to discuss the wording with me. I thank him and his officials for the valuable meeting we had last Friday morning. However, the Labour Party still has a fundamental difficulty with the way in which this proposal is being advanced. We strongly believe that amendments to the Constitution should be fully examined by the Oireachtas before being put to the people. This House has a particular responsibility to ensure this is done. It is not acceptable to go to the people with a proposed amendment to the Constitution on which all parties may, in principle, be in agreement but which has received the most scant of examinations in the Legislature. What does this amendment say? What does it mean? Will we be any wiser following the debate this evening? How well informed will the public be by the time it votes on this proposal on 11 June?</P>
    <P>The Government is at fault for not having presented this proposal on time. The current Minister has been in office for almost two years and, in spite of the postponement of local elections, has still not produced any legislation to reform local government. Now, at the last minute, to amend the Constitution, he has introduced a Bill which has been badly thought out and for <Col N="658" /> which insufficient time has been provided for adequate debate.</P>
    <P>While the primary responsibility for the hasty, poorly considered amendment rests with the Government, the media must share some responsibility for keeping people in the dark. It is very disappointing that, to date, virtually no media attention has been given to the proposal to amend the Constitution. People have a right to know what changes are being proposed to the Constitution and what arguments are being made about it. It is the media's job to inform people of this but so far it has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a virtual press encampment outside the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights in Kildare House, with people looking for a constitutional crisis where one probably does not exist. However, in this House in which there is a real proposal to change the Constitution, nobody appears to be interested.</P>
    <P>The wording of any proposal to amend the Constitution is critical as it must stand the test of time and of the courts. We must be clear about what the words mean and about the manner in which they may be interpreted. We know from experience that the words inserted in the Constitution may turn out to mean something quite different to what was originally intended. Those who insisted in 1983 on the particular wording of the constitutional amendment on abortion did not envisage that the Supreme Court would subsequently interpret it in a way its advocates hardly intended.</P>
    <P>Today, we are presented with a proposed new Article 28A of the Constitution which is divided into three paragraphs. This is the first time an article of the Constitution is being enumerated as an &lsquo;A'. I do not like that as it is suggestive of afterthought, putting an agusín in the Constitution. What do the three sections mean? Paragraph 3 sets down a maximum interval between local elections. I welcome this and have called for it for some time. Eight years have passed since we have had local elections for city and county councils and the previous elections to urban district councils and town commissions were held following a nine year interval. We must not allow that to happen again. The proposed Article 28A.3 will prevent this. What exactly does it provide for? Does it provide for a maximum interval of five or six years? At the meeting I attended last week with the Minister's officials, I was informed that the clause reading &ldquo;not later than the end of the fifth year after the year in which they were last held&rdquo; means five years. I would like the Minister to confirm that.</P>
    <P>What exactly do paragraphs 1 and 2 mean? Do they amount to anything and how will they be interpreted? Article 28A.1 begins by stating that the State recognises the role of local government. What is the significance of such recognition? The term &ldquo;the State recognises&rdquo; appears elsewhere in the Constitution, not in relation to an arm or structure of Government but to concepts outside <Col N="659" /> of Government. In Article 41.1.1 the State recognises the family. In Article 43.2.1 the State recognises the principles of social justice. It is nonsensical for the Constitution to declare that the State recognises local government &ndash; an arm of the State recognising it. If the Constitution was to state that the State recognises the principle of local democracy it would mean something, but the phrase which is presented to us does not mean that.</P>
    <P>What is being recognised? We are told that the role of local government is being recognised. What does that mean? It is clear from the text that the role, powers and functions and, if we look at Article 28A.2, the very existence of local authorities which the Constitution will recognise, are confined to those conferred by law. At most, all that is being recognised by this proposed constitutional amendment is what is provided for in law. That makes the proposed constitutional provision superfluous.</P>
    <P>The proposed wording does not set down any principles for local government, such as the principle of local democracy or subsidiarity. The wording means that the Constitution will be pliable as regards local government. Whatever local government legislation is enacted will automatically be constitutional under this provision. A legislative measure to weaken local government would be made constitutional by this proposed amendment. A Bill to take powers and functions away from local government would be constitutional because the Constitution will recognise the role of local government as prescribed in law. Law is something which changes. Instead of strengthening local government, Article 28A.1 in particular could probably be used to undermine local democracy and to weaken the constitutional rights of the citizen. Since whatever is prescribed in law is being given constitutional status, any local government law will now be constitutional. This will deny the citizen the right to challenge any local government legislation on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>Where does it leave the issue of abolishing councils? Under the Local Government Act, 1941, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has the power to replace an elected council with a commissioner where the council fails to adopt an annual estimate. Would such an abolition be constitutional now under Article 28A.1 or would it be unconstitutional under Article 28A.2, which states explicitly that there shall be directly elected local authorities? </P>
    <P>What about equality of representation? At present, the ratio of councillors to population is about 1:1,200 in counties such as County Leitrim but it is almost 1:10,000 in Dublin city. Each of these councillors has the same status and the same voting entitlement in elections to Seanad Éireann. Is this inequality of representation constitutional under our existing Constitution? Does the amendment confer constitutionality on a <Col N="660" /> legislative and electoral arrangement which is clearly unequal and unfair? </P>
    <P>I support the constitutional recognition of local government. If, however, we are going to provide in the Constitution for the recognition of local government and for the recognition of the principle of local democracy, we should do it in a meaningful way. We certainly should do it in a way which does not expose the text of the Constitution to an interpretation which was probably not intended by its proposers.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution is a document for the setting down of basic principles upon which law is based. It is not a document for the expression of political platitudes. The constitutional amendment to be put to the people should provide for a recognition of the principle of local democracy, and not only of local government but also of regional government &ndash; a requirement of the European Convention on Local Self Government which this constitutional amendment appears to address.</P>
    <P>There has been a debate in this State about what constitutes regionalisation and how regions are to be formed. The Government attempted to form and reform regions in a totally <i>ad hoc</i> manner. Clearly there should be a constitutional basis for our approach to regionalisation in this State. This is the place to provide for that.</P>
    <P>The constitutional amendment should state who is entitled to vote. Nowhere in the Constitution does it state who is entitled to vote in local elections. As we know from practice, the entitlement to vote in local elections is wider than it is for Dáil or presidential elections. The Constitution should set that down. It is important that it should do so now as we are likely to become a State with a multi-cultural population. It should also, as Deputy Dukes mentioned, state who is entitled to stand for election to local government. I see this as an opportunity to extend the entitlement to everyone who is entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>It should deal with equality of representation. I acknowledge that there are geographical and demographic considerations which must be taken into account in local democracy, but inequalities exist in the local government system &ndash; the disparity in representation between some parts of the State and others and the type of local authority which represents the population. There are towns which have town commissioners with populations which are much higher than other towns which have urban district councils. That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidiarity, to which there has been a great deal of lip service, should be provided for in the Constitution. A set of principles which underpins local government should be inserted into the Constitution to which legislative provisions can then be subsequently addressed.</P>
    <P>We needed much much more time to address these issues than the Government allowed. I see enormous dangers in putting a constitutional referendum to the people which the House has not properly teased out. There are many issues which may arise in the course of the debate. The Mini<Col N="661" /> ster said it would be a nice idea to have the referendum run in conjunction with the local elections and it would have been if he had produced the legislation on time, but he did not and, consequently, he has left us with too little time to give proper consideration to this proposal in order for it to be put to the people on 11 June. There is no urgency to have the referendum on 11 June.</P>
    <P>The practical provision in the Bill &ndash; to have a five yearly interval for local elections &ndash; will not come up for some time. Even though we would all like to have a constitutional amendment on local government run in conjunction with the local elections, the requirements of proper debate and reasoned consideration of the proposal being put outweigh the convenience and desirability of that. This proposal should be debated more fully by the Oireachtas and a longer period should be provided for the public to absorb what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities are holding their final meetings before the local elections. At the very least, elected members of local authorities should have a reasonable period of time within which to consider the proposed constitutional amendment to underpin local government. There is no point in coming into the House, as the Minister of State has done, and making platitudes about the importance of the elected members. The fact is the elected tier of local government will not have a real opportunity to properly consider the constitutional amendment which is about their own existence.</P>
    <P>The lack of time given for consideration of this amendment to the Constitution leaves us with no option but to oppose the Second Stage reading of the Bill. I say that with considerable regret because I support the principle of giving constitutional recognition to local government and including in the Constitution the five yearly interval for the holding of local elections, but we should not play fast and loose with the Constitution, as I believe the Government is doing on this occasion. Our Constitution is too important a document to have amended in the way the Government is proposing this evening, even if it is on an issue on which there is general political agreement.</P>
    <P>We have not had the opportunity, and we will not have it during the limited time available for the Committee Stage debate tomorrow, to give detailed consideration to the wording that is to be put to the people. We have not had the opportunity of hearing the views of interested people outside this House including, for example, constitutional lawyers or those involved in local government who may have valuable opinions on what we are proposing to put in our Constitution. This is not the way to treat the Constitution. This amendment should not be put to the people on 11 June, not because there is any principal objection to it, but because the Government which has produced it has given us far too little time to consider it.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill. It was wrong of various Governments to defer local elections. I thought eight years was the longest deferral, but Deputy Gilmore has reminded me that there was a nine year interval between 1985 and 1994 for the town commission and urban council elections. Long deferrals of eight or nine years devalue the system of local government.</P>
      <P>I agree with the speakers who said we should examine other issues on Friday, 11 June, but there could be confusion if a second referendum were held on the issue Deputy Gilmore put forward in his Private Members' Bill. There will be a ballot paper for election to town commissions, urban councils, county councils, corporations as well as the European elections. I would like to see a Bill at some stage which would state a fixed term for Dáil elections. I understand there is a fixed term in most European countries as well as in the United States. Fixed terms for governments have also been put in place in the emerging democracies in eastern Europe. I hope that issue will be examined at some time in the future.</P>
      <P>I hope this legislation and the other Bills to be brought forward will restore functions which are proper to local authorities and to the councils. In recent years, the administration of water schemes in my county was delegated to the county council. That is welcome. The collection of motor taxation has been diverted to the local authorities, another welcome development.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that the referendum will take place in the centenary year of local government. In County Galway, new local authority offices were officially opened in the past two weeks by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. On that occasion the Mayor of Galway said she usually welcomes visitors to Galway, but she was now welcoming a new building. That building is in the heart of Galway city.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the alignment of local elections with the European elections. This is not the first time that has happened. In 1979, when the first European elections took place, elections to the local authorities were held on that day. In 1994, the European elections were held in conjunction with the urban council and town commission elections. I realise this may be seen as an opportunity to bring out all the voters, something which has not portrayed us in a good light, but it is an opportunity we have availed of in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years, local authorities considered the question of improving existing services and providing new ones. During my term on the county council, I have seen the establishment of committees, such as the arts committee to which the Minister of State referred. The arts committee in Galway has been quick to respond to the famous Galway arts festival and to bring events organised by groups like Druid and Macnas from the city to the rural areas of County Galway. Another area which has seen development is the library services. We have a new library in the city and there <Col N="663" /> is provision for new libraries in other parts of Galway, particularly Oranmore and Loughrea.</P>
    <P>The county council has also played a major role in improving our health services. The council was the original health service provider, but the councillors are represented on health boards and vocational education committees. An interesting committee in County Galway is the inter-county railway committee with representatives from the five counties of Connacht. It has been shown that county councils and councillors have a role in setting up new committees and providing necessary new services.</P>
    <P>The new councils will be busy and there will be a new role for county councillors. There is representation by councillors on the new body for the regional authorities and in the western regional authority there has been much debate over the past number of years on Objective One status for the western region. The western regional authority committee has been to the forefront in pressing for Objective One status which we can now say has been a successful campaign. Last Friday, the Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, attended the official opening of the Western Development Commission. Our councillors are represented on that commission which has its headquarters at Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon. I hope the ambitious £3.7 billion plan which has been published will be debated in this House and supported by all Members. I know it has the support of our local representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to loyalty to county, town and city. That is a noble aspiration but there is not always sufficient co-operation between the city and county councils. There should be co-operation but sometimes there is jealousy when, for example, cities are granted urban renewal status or a similar designation. There is also the issue of cities expanding their county borough status where they have to literally get territory from the county council. We have problems concerning town and urban council boundaries and town commissioner areas. I hope there will be more co-operation in the future between those bodies. I welcome the fact that urban renewal status has been granted to smaller towns in recent years. Later this year I hope the Minister will announce village and rural schemes. This will be a welcome development for smaller towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Councils have done much good work with regard to the national tidy towns competition. More towns and villages become involved in this competition every year. The new councils have an opportunity to become more involved in this competition and the whole issue of litter prevention which the Minister of State, Deputy Danny Wallace, has been active in promoting. I hope resources will be provided to keep our towns tidy.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have also been active on the issue of heritage. Galway County Council recently received an award for its work on heri<Col N="664" /> tage projects. Towns such as Athenry, Portumna and Kilmacduagh, a monastic site, are three areas which have benefited from the input of Departments and local authorities. I congratulate Galway County Council on its award.</P>
    <P>Waste management is a critical issue for local authorities. Every county has been looking at landfill sites even though the Government has stated that landfill will be a last resort. There has been a move towards regional landfill sites. It is time that county councils clearly stated the policy for each county. Information is not being made available &ndash; there are no seminars for making information available to the public on landfill sites, recycling or the separation of refuse. These issues should be dealt with by every local authority.</P>
    <P>Ballinasloe in the largest town in my constituency and is taking refuse from two other counties as well as from County Galway. Some communities fear that without discussion with them, incinerators and landfill sites will be located in their areas. I hope the new councils will look at these issues and that education and information will be provided so that as in most European countries every household will separate refuse into a number of bins. Recycling is the way forward and I would like the new authorities to adopt this approach.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and wish him well. I support the Bill and I hope the question will be carried by the people.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of this Bill in principle but I have some criticisms of the Government regarding the constitutional provision. Unlike my colleague in the Labour Party, my criticism is that there is not enough in the Bill concerning the constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>This proposal was recommended by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution more than two years ago. At the time, the committee carried out an analysis of whether there should be a general recognition of local government or whether specific powers should be mentioned. The committee came down in favour of a general recognition.</P>
      <P>My biggest complaint regarding local government was the regular postponement of elections. The all-party committee was adamant that a constitutional provision should be inserted stipulating that elections be held on a five-year basis. I am glad the Minister accepted that provision and agreed not to pursue his seven-year proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional review group sat for 18 months under Dr. Whitaker and produced 121 recommendations. The all-party committee produced three reports with many unanimous recommendations. In that context it is a meagre result to find only one provision in this Bill. A package <Col N="665" /> of measures should have been proposed to the House months ago so that there could have been an adequate debate. That package should then have been presented to the people on 11 June along with the election ballot papers.</P>
    <P>I have always held that we should avail of normal electoral arrangements to amend the Constitution rather than going to the expense of a special referendum. This would allow us to put forward many of the recommended changes to the Constitution in a cost-effective way. It is ridiculous that the Government did not adopt the views of the all-party committee on that. There were specific proposals concerning issues such as the constitutional recognition of the Ombudsman and minor, technical amendments which could have been put through. In particular, there was a proposal to reduce the age for membership of this House to 18 which was agreed on an all-party basis. There is no reason that package should not have been presented to the House in good time rather than presenting this single measure. That is my main criticism of the Government. I support the proposal in the Bill as it mirrors that of the all-party committee. My criticisms refer to what is not in the Bill &ndash; not what is in it.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the UK, all member states of the EU have a written constitution. Each of those countries, apart from Ireland, gives constitutional recognition to local government. One hundred years after the establishment of local government under the 1898 Act, it is time we inserted such a constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>There was a low opinion of local government at the time of the Free State Constitution. The impression was that local government was amateurish and that there was a high degree of venality in its operations. From a constitutional viewpoint, there was also a view that we should change our system to that of the UK.</P>
    <P>Subsequently there was not any constitutional recognition of local government in the 1937 Constitution. The European Charter of Local Government specifically asks members of the Council of Europe to accept the principle of local self-government and to recognise that role in their constitutions. We are behind time in introducing this provision, but it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>The five-year provision is the most important measure of all. Local government was substantially discredited by the regular postponement of local elections to suit the Government of the day. When it came to the crunch, every Government was more than happy to postpone local elections. It is a disgrace that on 11 June county councillors will be facing the polls for the first time in nine years. That is outrageous. That is why many of us were so keen on having an absolute constitutional requirement to have an election every five years.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dáil elections the constitutional provision is seven years and the statutory provision is five. It would be appropriate to provide for five years in the Constitution in respect local <Col N="666" /> government elections because our culture and tradition are such that it would be unthinkable for any government, even a government virtually on its last legs, like this one, to propose a change in the statutory provision when it was approaching the end of a five year term and, accordingly, to get an extension. The culture in relation to local government on the other hand has been the opposite. It has been virtually unthinkable for governments to go ahead with local elections within the appropriate five year period. That is why it is so necessary that we stick with five years in relation to local government elections as opposed to the seven year provision in relation to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether there should be just a general recognition of local government or a provision which would give details for the system and for the relationship between local government and central government was looked at by the Constitutional Review Group and by the all-party committee. There are arguments for and against, but the Constitution is not the place to provide for specific powers; these are a matter for statute. In terms of the relationship between central and local government, I would not be in favour of having that specifically spelt out in the Constitution because I am in favour of stronger local government, of more devolution, of a dynamic within local government. If specific powers were spelt out in the Constitution we might be providing a straitjacket which would prevent the development of local government. Now that we are putting local government into the Constitution the next step should be to see how we can develop local government and give it a dynamic far beyond what it has at the moment.</P>
    <P>That raises a very difficult problem that has never been fully and adequately addressed, that is, the financing of local government. Since the abolition of domestic rates, it has never been fully addressed by any party or any government. However, that is for another day. I hope it will be fully addressed in time and that we will see that development of local government that has produced such creativity and innovation in other countries where it has also been a safety valve for the expression of local views and has otherwise actually been what it is called, local government. We have not yet reached that stage and it will be some time before we do.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that, unless all the political parties in this House raise the profile of the constitutional amendment, people will be faced with an extra ballot paper on polling day about which they will not have a clue. There is a duty and responsibility, particularly on the political parties when they are talking about the European elections, county council or corporation elections, town commission or urban council elections, to mention this proposal so that canvassers will be reminded that it is worth putting into the Constitution and that they will ask people to support it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not here for the opening of this debate, but I had a quick look at the Mini<Col N="667" /> ster of State's speech and it does not seem to cover the question of how the arguments for and against this amendment are to be presented to the people and whether we are to have a commission in that regard. Perhaps when replying he could give an indication as to his proposals, in the post-McKenna judgment era, on how the people are to be fully informed about the proposed amendment and how the arguments for and against, if there are any against, are to be presented to the people.</P>

        <b>:</b> Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, agus mo bhuiochas don Teachta O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable to rush this amendment through in the way provided for by the Government. I am in full agreement with Deputy Gilmore on that. By pushing this amendment through with such unseemly haste, for the simple reason that it was not introduced on time, a very fine opportunity is being lost to have a proper discussion on local government and how it should be changed and improved.</P>
      <P>The most important provision in the Bill is that future governments cannot play fast and loose with the timing of local government elections. That is something that badly needed to be addressed. It would have been entirely appropriate if, in the presentations of the Minister and of the principal spokespersons of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, there had been some confessions and public wearing of sackcloth and ashes with regard to the postponement of local elections. The four biggest parties in Dáil Éireann were all party to the situation where, on 11 June, it will be eight years since the people last had an opportunity to vote for their local councillors. Fine Gael and Labour postponed those elections. I am surprised that Deputy Dukes did not take a very strong stand against that since he frequently lectures me here on the evils of Stalinism and the lack of democracy in the former Stalinist states which he wrongly labels as socialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a gross infringement of the democratic rights of the Irish people that the local elections have been manipulated in this way for nakedly political purposes. The local government elections should have been held in June 1996, but in 1996 the main political parties in the local councils around the country, in 1994 in the case of Dublin, had introduced the hated local taxes, water charges in particular in the case of Dublin, which introduction was a U-turn by them all on what they had said to the electorate in 1991. Naturally they evoked enormous anger among ordinary people and compliant taxpayers throughout the country and in June 1996 those political parties would have found themselves in the eye of a terrible storm when the electorate would certainly have shown their disapproval of them by voting in their droves for people who would have stood by what they said in opposition to these unjust local taxes. It was because of fear of what <Col N="668" /> the electorate might do that the local elections were delayed. That is an unforgivable manipulation. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats exacerbated the situation by allowing a further delay to June of this year. Undoubtedly, that was motivated by the questions of tribunals, planning scandals and so on.</P>
    <P>As a result of the anger on the ground, the Government recognises there should be no more tampering with the time of local elections. While I disagree totally with the method by which the Government is bringing this forward, that particular provision is to be welcomed. I support the motion to defer this issue so that there can be a longer discussion on it; however, if it is put to the people on 11 June, I will call on them to support it.</P>
    <P>My other main problem with this is the huge missed opportunity in regard to other crucial items affecting local government which the Government should have put on the agenda for constitutional change. I refer here, in particular, to the price of building land. When we discuss the appalling suffering caused by the housing crisis and when some of us call for stringent controls on building land and the need to stop speculation and the scandal of inflated land prices, the constitutional position is thrown up against us. The Kenny report believes a constitutional amendment is not required to control the price of building land and that view was echoed in the report of the four local authorities. However, if the Government feels that is the case, why did it not avail of the opportunity of putting a constitutional amendment before the people which included a provision whereby the price of building land could be controlled by legal means and local land bank authorities could be set up, or could be part of local government, to peg building land in urban areas at agricultural prices? That would dramatically reduce the obscene price of housing at present. Unfortunately, that opportunity was missed.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roim an cuid den Bhille a chuireann iachall ar an Rialtas toghchán áitiúil a chur ar siúl gach cúig bhliain agus tá an íde a thug rialtais éagsúla do na toghcháin áitiúla le fada náireach. Tá an locht faoi sin ar an gcuid is mó de na páirtithe polaitíochta anseo. Tá sé ocht mbliana ó bhí na toghcháin áitiúla deireannacha againn agus bhí na toghcháin a bhí againn i 1991 curtha ar athló chomh maith. Tá sé náireach go raibh na príomh páirtithe polaitíochta sa Dáil páirteach sa chinneadh sin na toghcháin sin a chur ar athló.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart an reifreann seo a chur siar go dtí an fómhar, go mbeadh níos mó díospóireachta agus níos mó ama le go bhféadfaí rudaí tábhachtacha eile a chur isteach sa Bhille. Ba cheart go háirithe go gcuirfí leasú isteach ann chun an Bhunreacht a leaú chun srian a chur ar phraghas talún. Is scanall é go bhfuil an Rialtas ag seasamh i leataoibh agus ag ligint do lucht mór tógála dul i mbun speiciúléireachta maidir le talamh tógála de agus de dheasca sin go mbeadh praghas na dtithe <Col N="669" /> £30,000 nó £40,000 níos daoire ná mar ba cheart dó a bheith.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire mar sin an leasú seo a chur ar athló go dtí an fómhar, go mbeadh díospóireacht cheart ann agus go dtiocfadh an Rialtas suas le leasaithe eile faoi mar a lua mé anois díreach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions which covered a wide range of topics. I doubt I will have time to reply comprehensively to all the points raised, for which I apologise. However, many of the topics are relevant to the local government Bill, so beidh lá eile againn for more in-depth debate and discussion.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the purpose of this amendment is to recognise the principle of local government and to fix the maximum interval between local elections. This gives effect to the recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution, which considered the form any amendment might take. It would be against the prevailing spirit of the Constitution if the amendment were to go into detail about the types of local authority, the range of functions which they may perform or the precise electoral arrangements. These are matters best left to legislation &ndash; such legislation could, of course, only operate within the constitutional framework now proposed.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be here today to introduce this Bill. It is the outcome of a lengthy process with origins in the 1991 Barrington report which recommended that constitutional recognition be accorded to local government. This recommendation was endorsed by the previous Government in its White Paper on Local Government and in various reports and by different commentators over the years, as I outlined in my earlier speech.</P>
      <P>It is especially pleasing and fitting that, in this local election year, the electorate will have the opportunity to ensure local elections are no longer postponed indefinitely. This is a positive development for local government and will help to underscore the many reforms which are now taking place.</P>
      <P>Another noteworthy aspect of the proposed constitutional amendment is the reference to promotion by local government of the interests of local communities by its initiatives. These few short words belie their significance. The days when local authorities had to operate within the straitjacket of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule have been gone for almost a decade. Section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1991, conferred a general competence on local authorities to act in the interests of local communities. This constitutional amendment copperfastens local government's role in promoting the interests of communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the outcome of this amendment, with the implementation of a renewal programme currently under way, will be to boost local authorities as a catalyst of local energy and initiative and as a facilitator and supporter of the combined <Col N="670" /> efforts of individuals and groups within the community. Indeed, that is the ethos behind the current initiative to bring local government and local development closer together, and for local government to regain its central role at local level in bringing together the various players to promote the development of local areas and communities.</P>
    <P>Constitutional recognition is but one element in a major programme for the renewal of local government which is under way. It sets down a clear marker for the Government's commitment. The renewal programme involves a new funding system for local government since January; a move for greater community involvement and real engagement with local interests via the SPCs; a major initiative to improve staffing and management resources and a push for better value for money, financial management, efficiency and customer service.</P>
    <P>A major local government Bill is currently being drafted to underpin the renewal programme and to modernise and consolidate local government law. It will provide for the enhancement of the role of the elected member, with better training and back up, and a new role for cathaoirligh, with a longer term of office and direct elections. There is also recognition of the distinctive status of local government, with the elimination of the dual mandate from a future date. Local government will form the central hub of the new arrangements in each city and county, bringing together the various States agencies, local development groups and social partners to provide the focus and co-ordination for local social, economic and cultural developments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore alleged undue haste as regards the proposed referendum. I wish to make a few points about that. The matter was considered in considerable detail by the review group on the Constitution, whose report was published in 1996 and copies of which have been available to all Deputies. Constitutional recognition was also considered by the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution whose first progress report, published in April 1997, set out a proposed text. Members of this House comprised a substantial portion of the membership of that committee. It is difficult therefore to see how the issue can now be considered almost as if it were an unexpected thunderbolt from the blue.</P>
    <P>Local elections are being held in June and what more appropriate occasion could there be on which to hold a referendum to accord constitutional recognition to local government? This point is further reinforced by the fact that this year marks the centenary of our local government system &ndash; local elections having first been held in 1899. Surely it is a most appropriate time to hold the referendum.</P>
    <P>If the referendum were not to be held in June, when would it be held? Apart from cost implications, which are minimised by holding it in conjunction with local and European elections, no Government in recent years &ndash; including the one <Col N="671" /> of which Deputy Gilmore was a member &ndash; has undertaken to hold a one off referendum on this issue. Now is the obvious time to deal with the matter, in conjunction with the June elections. I make no apologies therefore for bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dukes and Gilmore referred to the period of the fifth year for holding local elections, that is, up to the end of the fifth year. The use of the phrase is intended to give some flexibility, especially as there is discussion at European level to move the date for the European elections to May instead of June. Also, there is provision in European legislation to hold the European elections in July in the event of a major development. It is necessary, therefore, to have flexibility in the Constitution to allow for changes at European level so that both elections can be held on the same day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> As regards the matter raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, a Referendum Commission has been established for the referendum on local government recognition. The primary role of the commission is to explain the subject matter of a referendum to the population at large as simply and effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that the Constitution should have a simple provision on local government and this is what is proposed. I agree also that we should then move on to develop our system of local government. That is what the Government's programme of renewal is aimed at. A major local government Bill will follow this year. I have already outlined a series of initiatives that are now under way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 21, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;limitation of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to change the Title of the Bill to &ldquo;Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Limitation of Expenditure) Bill, 1999&rdquo;; the reason for it is very clear. The Bill seeks to introduce to local elections procedures which are already for force in general elections and by-elections to this House in relation to donations and expenditure and which, next month, will be operated for the first time in relation to European Parliament elections. However, the Bill omits to place a limit on the expenditure of candidates in local elections, in sharp contrast to the limits placed on the expenditure by candidates and parties in general elections, by-elections and elections to the European Parliament. This creates an anomalous situation where, although candidates in general elections, by-elections and European Parliament elections have limits placed on the expenditure in which they and their parties can engage, candidates in local elections would have no limit placed on their expenditure. In theory, a candidate for election to a local authority could spend unlimited amounts of money, if he or she were stupid enough to want to do that, while a candidate in a general or European Parliament election must observe limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" />
      <Col N="674" /> Members will agree that the limits on expenditure by Dáil election candidates are tightly drawn. We have had two by-elections since those limits came into operation and, although I was not involved in that aspect of either by-election, I know from my colleagues who were in charge of running the elections and from the staff who were employed to help comply with the requirements of the legislation that the expenditure limits for by-elections left very little room for extravagance. I am not complaining about this, I merely state it as a fact.</P>
    <P>European election candidates, whose expenditure is limited to £150,000 per candidate, will also find that this limit is tightly drawn. A great many candidates will be quite happy that this limit has been placed on European election candidates. I was a candidate in the first direct election to the European Parliament &ndash; an unsuccessful one &ndash; and while 20 years ago our election culture had not developed to its present point, I found it quite an expensive campaign. In subsequent European elections expenditure levels have tended to go up and, although not entirely relevent, it is in keeping with my personal prejudices to say that no party has resisted this temptation and the left-wing parties have been just as eager to spend money as others. For general elections, by-elections and European elections the expenditure limits are quite tightly drawn and will rein in the natural tendency of candidates and their supporters to spend more and more money on posters, canvassing cards and gimmicks of all kinds.</P>
    <P>The campaign for next month's local elections is in its early stages. Like many of my colleagues, I have already established the budget which we can afford in the various electoral areas, given the numbers of candidates. We all need to spend carefully but I have no doubt that, during the next few weeks, some candidates will become either more exuberant or more anxious and will push up expenditure. Until now there has been no limit on the expenditure by candidates in local elections and any resulting unfairness is unaffected by this Bill which neither imports a new unfairness nor gets rid of an existing one. That is wrong. If we believe that there should be a limit on election expenditure &ndash; and it seems that we do &ndash; there should be a limit on expenditure for local elections in the same way as for general elections, by-elections and European elections. If the principle is valid for one set of elections it is valid for another.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hear the argument that such a limit would be too complicated and its operation would place too great a burden on local authorities and various other people because of the large number of local election candidates. I have tabled amendments to deal with with that argument. I see no reason the Public Offices Commission could not supervise and invigilate this process as it does in for general elections, by-elections and European elections. Even if the Public Offices Commission feels it cannot invigilate the expenditure of every candidate, it <Col N="675" /> could take a random sample of candidates at an early stage and invigilate those. There is no reason, in a more relaxed period after the election, the commission could not go over the declarations made by candidates and their parties and decide whether the limits on expenditure and the provisions of the legislation had been infringed.</P>
    <P>On one hand it is said that this cannot be done without creating the need for more bureaucracy while, on the other, local authorities will be expected to collect all the information about donations and expenditure required to be given to them under the terms of the Bill and then do nothing with it except tell the public that they have the information and that it may be consulted at a designated place. That is nonsense. I see no reason for having a mass of information simply so that people can look at it.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is more to the Bill than this. It places limits on the size of donations which can be accepted by candidates and lays down penalties for contravening these limits. However, the whole procedure is incomplete. It is not a good idea to put an incomplete procedure in place. The procedure set out in the Bill does not lead to anything. It may be interesting to know that X or Y received two or three donations of over £500 during the course of a local election campaign and that he or she spent £7,000 or £8,000 on the election but if that is the sum total, candidates have nothing to fear and all we will have is a mass of useless information in local authorities that will contribute nothing to changing any aspect of the electoral system.</P>
    <P>We should make this amendment and then proceed to consider the rest of the proposals about what the permitted levels of expenditure should be. I have made one suggestion and Deputy Gilmore made another. We are pointing in the same direction. If the Minister is open to suggestions, between now and the end of the debate we can arrive at figures which would represent a reasonable approach, even if they are a little tightly drawn like the other expenditure limits about which I have spoken. We would then have a unity of approach to expenditure on elections which is in keeping with the logic of the system we have put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue which has to be addressed is whether there will be a limit to the amount a candidate may spend in the local elections. Without it the Bill is meaningless. As Deputy Dukes said, there is a limit to what a candidate may spend in an election to Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament. Under the Bill there will be no limit to what a candidate may spend in seeking to be elected to a local authority. What this means is that a candidate who has a lot of money or a wealthy backer or major contributor or contributors who will put up money for an expensive campaign will be at a distinct advantage in local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> The potential to buy a seat is far greater in local elections than in a general election. As we know from experience, the turnout in local elections tends to be considerably lower than in a general election. It is not far-fetched to envisage a situation in a particular local authority where a candidate, highly resourced and running an expensive campaign, is elected for no other reason than he or she had the money to run a better campaign than somebody dependent on local community support.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about the potential for corruption in public life. The potential for corruption is much greater in local government than in central Government. Many of the decisions made at local government level have the capacity to confer considerable wealth on small numbers of people. In the case of decisions relating to land rezoning somebody can be made a multimillionaire on the vote of a county council. For somebody who sees the possibilities, the potential for buying their own member of a local authority and funding them is much greater. There is, therefore, an unanswerable case for spending limits in local elections.</P>
    <P>Why are spending limits not proposed in the Bill? Is the reason administrative? I cannot see where the administrative difficulty is. The Bill puts in place an administrative system for the declaration of amounts spent. Every candidate will have to make a declaration to the local authority within a certain period after the elections and every party will have to nominate a person who will have to account for donations and amounts spent. A system will be in place under which limits can be monitored.</P>
    <P>If the reason is not administrative, is it political? Will the Minister clarify what he said on the matter in the Seanad? In reply to my colleague, Senator Pat Gallagher, the Minister indicated that it was his intention not only to have no spending limits in local elections but to get rid of the spending limits set down in legislation for general elections. Is the Minister pursuing a political agenda to get rid of spending limits and return to the bad old days when candidates could spend any amount they wanted and when the highly resourced were placed at an advantage over everybody else?</P>
    <P>The spending limits I am proposing are £3,000 for a three seat electoral area, £4,000 for a four seat electoral area and £5,000 for a five seat electoral area or greater. Like Deputy Dukes, I am open to discussion on the amounts but limits should be set down in the Bill. What ground rules are we following in this debate? Is this an administrative or a political issue?</P>

      <P>The question of expenditure limits was dealt with on Second Stage and in the Seanad. I do not accept the argument being used by some in treating members of local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas in a similar fashion that this is an administrative <Col N="677" /> or a political issue. One of the problems with the 1997 legislation is that limits were plucked out of the air. There was no research to back up the amounts selected. Already in two by-elections parties opposite had major difficulties in staying within the limits imposed at that time. That is an argument for ensuring that, at local government level at least, we have some&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I thank my colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party for affording me the opportunity to give a Second Reading to my Private Members' Bill, the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Amendment) Bill, 1999. The fact I secured the support of such an experienced group of politicians from different parts of the country is indicative of the extent of the problem of unfinished estates.</P>
      <P>Since I first published this Bill I have received letters of support and telephone calls from people throughout the country complimenting me on and wishing me well with the Bill. There was a consistent message in the communications &ndash; that the scandal of unfinished estates must be removed from planning and housing developments and that the existing legislation is totally inadequate to deal with the problems. I am pleased and encouraged that various local authorities support the principle of this Bill, and that includes politicians across the political spectrum. I hope that will be the case tomorrow night.</P>
      <P>There are three elements to this Bill. It enables the planning authorities to take the previous track record of developers and builders into consideration when considering new planning applications. In effect, the Bill, if enacted, will facilitate the refusal of planning permission if, in the opinion of the relevant planning authority, previous planning permissions were not carried out and completed within a specific period and in accordance will all conditions contained in the permission. That includes the standard of work on the houses, the completion of roads and footpaths, the provision of public lighting, the taking in charge of the estate, the dedication of the open space, when required, and the implementation of the relevant health and safety standards for building workers during the construction period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> The Bill provides for the planning authorities to condition in planning permission the payment of a financial contribution to the planning authority towards the development of community facilities, including buildings and football pitches, for the benefit of the community within which the proposed development is situated. That is what I classify as the community benefit of developments and planning. The Bill also provides for house purchasers who have suffered loss or damage as a result of the failure of the person who secured the planning permission to comply with the conditions of that permission and to enable them to bring and maintain an action for damages and costs.</P>
    <P>Since I first became a public representative in 1983, the problem of unfinished estates has always been on the agenda of numerous residents' association meetings in my constituency. I would hazard a guess that is also the case in the constituencies of many TDs. The most frustrating aspect of the problem as far as I was concerned was my inability, as a public representative, to deal satisfactorily with the issue due to the inadequacy of current planning legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Given that I was frustrated and knocking my head against a wall in endeavouring to deal with the problem, how does one think house owners feel having mortgaged themselves to the hilt? They are struggling to make repayments and find they have to wait in many cases three to eleven years for the estate to be taken into charge. For example, there is an estate in my constituency in which a generation of young people have grown up without the benefit of an open space in which to play; children were obliged to play on the roads. I could give many examples but I do not believe it is necessary as Members of all political hues have their own experiences in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>We are consistently asked by frustrated and angry residents at meetings how can a developer, who has failed to complete an estate within a specific time and who has refused to comply with planning conditions, apply for and be granted a further planning permission on another site, whether in the same county, down the road or elsewhere. We all know of cases where builders, in such circumstances, have left a trail of havoc in their wake, yet there was nothing the planning authorities could do other than initiate enforcement action, which is a long drawn out process.</P>
    <P>In the light of the crisis in the housing market with spiralling and unrealistic house prices, is it satisfactory that a small group, which I classify as cowboy developers, are allowed to drive a coach and four through the existing inadequate planning legislation? That is the question which must be posed to the Minister and the Government and which the people who have suffered down the years ask us. Given the experience of thousands of householders caught up in this situation, I undertook to do everything within my power, as a TD, to highlight this issue and to bring about change, if at all possible. The Minister knows the <Col N="679" /> situation as he is a practical politician. It is time to respond; it is time for action, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Irish people have a tradition of aspiring to home ownership. We are unique in this regard among EU member states. Over 80 per cent of dwellings in this State are owner occupied. Couples and single people are willing to take out huge mortgages to achieve the dream of owning a home of their own. Over the years this has been a great boost to the State as the demand for local authority housing or social housing was kept relatively low. Unfortunately, like many other things, this has changed in recent years as a result of the Government's totally unsatisfactory response to the housing crisis. The average price of a new house &ndash; a three bedroomed dwelling &ndash; for which loans were approved in Dublin has increased from £62,500 in 1992 to over £120,000 in 1999 and still rising. For the unfortunate people who are making efforts to secure a house of their own, the repayments are in the order of £650 per month. In most cases both partners have no option but to work outside the home. What can these people expect in return for the biggest investment of their lives? I do not think it is too much to expect that houses are constructed to an acceptable standard, that roads and footpaths are useable, that public lighting is operable and that open spaces are developed, planted and maintained so that the children of these people can play in safety. I wonder what the Minister's view is on this matter.</P>
    <P>In recent months I came across a case where a builder constructed dwellings which were not in accordance with planning permission. The gradient of the houses is excessive and the residents are experiencing difficulties reversing out of their driveways, and in many cases find it impossible. The planning authorities asked what they could do as the houses had been built. Is it any wonder the house owners are angry and demanding changes in legislation?</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the scandal of unfinished estates is being caused by a small minority of builders. However, this group is not only causing grief and stress to householders, but is giving the building industry in general a bad name. It is my opinion that the CIF and the Irish Homebuilders Association, which are well aware of the problems, should be more pro-active in endeavouring to clean up their industry. In all fairness how can these organisations continue to register builders whom they know fail in their duty to properly complete estates? Both organisations have questions to answer. Given their inaction to date it is imperative that legislation be enacted to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for what I call a community benefit of planning whereby an applicant securing planning permission may be required as a condition to make a financial contribution to the local authority towards the development of facilities such as buildings and football pitches. <Col N="680" /> This concept is enshrined in planning legislation in England and has been of great benefit to the community. It is of particular benefit in the years after a new development has been completed when the children of the new occupants are growing up and need safe, open spaces for sport and recreation, a youth club or community centre.</P>
    <P>Swords, in my constituency, is one of the fastest growing towns in Ireland with a population in excess of 27,000. While the people have witnessed the negative and positive aspects of development, there is a major shortage of football pitches and there is no community centre, apart from the facilities provided by some of the local sports clubs. Let us imagine the developments which could have taken place if developers had been required to contribute £300 per house for the provision of facilities. Small community facilities could have been provided at strategic locations throughout the town, thereby providing a network of high quality sport and recreation facilities for the growing population of Swords. This community benefit of planning could be applied to every town.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions in the Bill are the way to move forward and should be enshrined in legislation. I have no doubt that some Deputies, hopefully a minority, when they walk through the division lobbies tomorrow evening, will endeavour to find fault with the Bill. Some may say that a further financial contribution in terms of granting planning permission would hike up the cost of houses. This point has already been put to me and I reject it out of hand. The cost of housing is the most important social issue in the country. The huge jump in house prices, particularly over the past few years, has nothing to do with such things as a community charge of, for example, £300 levied on a builder. The crisis is much broader, and if the Government was serious about tackling the issues it would adopt the radical proposals contained in the housing commission document recently published by the Labour Party. One recommendation of the commission, namely, the introduction of a price certificate, would rapidly reduce astronomical house prices which are crippling so many young couples. I will not accept the spurious argument that passage of the Bill would increase prices, while the Government has sat on its hands for the past two years as house prices went through the roof.</P>
    <P>Certain developers endeavouring to advance rezoning proposals in a development plan have no difficulty in doing a deal involving a financial contribution towards the provision of sporting facilities. This is catching on throughout the country. It depends, of course, on the success of a rezoning application. I am totally opposed to developers or builders using the legitimate needs of a community as an added incentive or a carrot to influence rezoning. Builders and developers are engaged in using the legitimate needs of communities to enhance their rezoning proposals. In many places they have pitted communities <Col N="681" /> against each other; this is wrong. However, I have no difficulty whatsoever in encouraging a community planning benefit as put forward in my Bill and on the basis of legislation. Let everything be above board and accountable.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to the recent moves to facilitate high density development in an attempt to relieve pressure in the housing market. On the basis of the Minister's proposals, more houses per acre will require a reduction in the size of private gardens and that implies that apartment living may well become an everyday reality for some families. It is imperative that if high density proposals are to work &ndash; there are questions in this regard &ndash; they must be first class developments and tie in with the proper planning and development of the area in which they are located. In this regard we cannot afford to have cowboy developers walking through the system and abusing the concept we are now trying to put forward.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow night I will have an opportunity to close the debate. Not everything in the Bill is perfect. How could it be when it is introduced by a backbencher? However, the principle of the Bill is worthy of the support of the House because it is the demand of the people and the duty of the House to do that. I hope the Minister of State takes on board the concept of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan, on publishing this timely and important legislation. Housing is quickly becoming the most pressing national problem and threatens to undermine the success of the booming economy. The provision of affordable housing is one matter the Government has failed to tackle meaningfully. Even for those fortunate enough to be in a position to secure a home, loopholes in the legislation have resulted in a situation where basic construction work on homes and facilities in housing complexes have been left unfinished and those responsible can continue this practice with impunity.</P>
      <P>The legislation is consumer-driven. It places a legal responsibility on construction companies to carry out the work central to the application for planning permission and which was promised to the consumer prior to the sale of the home. It promotes best practice in the industry and seeks to compel all constructors to raise their standards to those equivalent to the best in the industry. Despite all the efforts of councils, county and urban district, there are still developers who are solely profit-driven and are prepared to ignore the basic legal requirements of their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory limits, both financial and legal, must be set to prevent rogue developers using unfortunate, in many cases, first time buyers as their guinea pigs. These unfortunate people, driven to buy by the tremendous increasing demand for housing and purchasing in almost all cases where estates have not been completed, are dependent upon the responsible attitude of the developer to fulfil the conditions attached to the permission <Col N="682" /> granted by the local authority. In too many cases, unfortunately, they find the developer has no intention of completing the estate within a reasonable time of the purchaser taking up residence.</P>
    <P>I regret my experience in south Kildare is that young families buoyed by the Celtic tiger who have bought houses there now find themselves residing in estates where no green areas have been developed, there is no street lighting and no basic road structure in many cases. These problems cause great concern for the people involved in terms of their safety, that of their parents and those who visit them and in terms of security and safety problems. It is something that must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>As legislators, we must ensure the Celtic tiger does not devour its own in the interests of profiteering by those developers who are only interested in personal gain and who ignore the lawful right of the purchaser to their entitlement to a properly completed home, environment and serviced infrastructure. There are many things Deputies find difficult to put right but this is not one of them. The Government is already on record as recognising that this is an important issue. It should not do what it did when my party raised this issue in the Seanad through Senator Seán Ryan, as he then was, vote down the Bill. It should accept it, bring it to Committee Stage and implement this necessary and reasonable proposal. I have no problem in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also commend my colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan, for bringing this timely legislation before us. It concerns the basic elements of human living in that much of the ability of families and individuals to pursue a good life is concerned with their environment. The House should address the issue of people living in an environment without adequate lighting, where roads are in a dishevelled state for five, six, seven or more years, where there is inadequate green space, where an estate has not been adequately laid out or finished in accordance with the granted planning permission, is developed house by house or a few houses at a time, as happened in my constituency. Our predecessors should probably have dealt with this over the past 36 or 37 years. Bad design and a badly planned environment can have negative effects on our lives. Many of the anti-social and other difficult problems society faced in the 1980s and the early years of this decade resulted from the condition of the built environment. It is in that context I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan said, it may well be that the rogue builders who construct a number of houses, who disappear having only completed a basic snagging list and who spend decades fleeing from the rightful demands of residents' associations are in a minority, but there is an obligation on the House, the Construction Industry Federation and other agencies, such as the Irish Home Builders' <Col N="683" /> Association, to ensure there is a legislative approach to the matter. My colleagues referred to the fine tradition of home ownership, something we have struggled to maintain in recent years because of the massive doubling of house prices and the lethargic reaction of the Government in coping with the crisis.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of Dublin City Council in the Mansion House last night, we struggled to come to terms with the first estates being planned under the affordable housing scheme. One of the difficulties was that neither councillors nor officials knew the exact dimensions, criteria and carry-through of the scheme. I hope when the Minister of State speaks with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, he will bring that to his attention.</P>
    <P>Large areas of my constituency, such as the estates in Clonshaugh and the Grange Abbey estate and environs in Donaghmede, have suffered for 25 to 30 years from the phenomenon of unfinished estates. My area of Clonshaugh has been plagued in that period by the problem of derelict sites and laneways throughout unfinished estates. It has been the responsibility of management committees and residents' associations to try to unravel, usually slowly and painfully, the mistakes made by the builders of the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
    <P>The Grange Abbey estate had for 25 years a massive road reservation through it, with the public sector and the builders who constructed it making no plans or preparations to allow the 500 householders to live in that type of dispersed estate. Estates in the Sutton area have been built house by house resulting in the phenomenon of people paying huge mortgages for expensive houses and, in one case, living for seven years in what was effectively a building site. That is an outrageous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>A major new estate has been developed in Clare Hall on the northern fringes of my constituency, also the northern fringes of Dublin city. It is effectively a new parish for the city and the constituency. Many of the conditions in the original planning permission for that, in many ways, meritorious development relating to boundaries of green areas, railings and the historical monument on the site were not implemented.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill I am happy to commend. Deputy Ryan has certainly done his homework. His Bill provides a legal framework in sections 3 and 4 whereby a rogue builder who has misbehaved and caused heartache to householders over a number of years may be put out of the business if he does not change his ways. Perhaps that is a strong measure but many householders feel this kind of legislation is needed. I commend the Bill to the House and I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Ryan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for introducing this Bill <Col N="684" /> which is important to people in many parts of the country. As the Deputy stated, there is a problem in practically every local authority area. Galway Corporation, of which I was a member for 18 years, once dealt with one builder regarding six unfinished estates. The builder manifested several different titles to his company, which had developed each estate in turn. I recall that complaints about one of the estates went on for 13 years. As a councillor for the area I was regularly asked when would the corporation provide facilities ranging from lighting and grass-cutting to maintenance and my reply always had to be that the corporation had not yet taken over the estate. I was totally unsatisfied in all those years with the response of the local authority, which gave the impression that it was involved in secret negotiations with the builder to exercise some kind of moral suasion to get him on side. I will emphasise a point Deputy Ryan made. There are builders who recognise their responsibilities and who finish estates, but I mention the builder with six unfinished estates because there are a hard core who seem to think that they will get away with it again and again.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me the Construction Industry Federation exercised little influence on such builders. I do not know whether the builders concerned were members of CIF but I know that in at least one case the builder was a member of the federation. The time has come when we will be able to give citizens a guarantee about finishing building projects.</P>
    <P>I agree with another point Deputy Ryan made about the text of his Bill, lest anybody suggest there is the slightest suggestion that the Bill is unconstitutional. Even under the 1963 Act, it is perfectly open to a local authority, in granting planning permission, to take into account the capacity to deliver the project for which application has been made. If there is clear evidence that those proposing the project have failed again and again and are in flagrant violation of undertakings which they have given again and again, why should they be listened to or believed when making a further application?</P>
    <P>The issue at elections is always the same. People say they have paid for their houses, moved into virtual building sites and they cannot get the builder to come back.</P>
    <P>The Bill has three elements. First, the track record of the builder-applicant should be taken into account. Second, there should be a levy for community benefit to sit side by side with the proper planning which the local authority might suggest in regard to provisions. Third, damages should be awarded to those whose contracts with the developer have been broken.</P>
    <P>Anyone who votes against the Bill is voting for the continuation of these abuses and I would invite householders and people who live in unfinished estates to note that fact. The time has come to deal with this problem. If the Government is serious, it will state that it accepts the three principles of Deputy Ryan's Bill. Then if it wants to <Col N="685" /> improve on the text, let it do so on Committee Stage. It would be unforgivable if the Government voted down a Bill which sought to achieve these three objectives.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the argument about what is happening with regard to the current housing crisis, which is denied by the Government. There is a housing crisis at every level of housing from private and public rented accommodation through to affordable housing. Couples with two incomes who must take time away from family life effectively to become mortgage slaves to purchase shelter in a highly speculative market are not assisted by the piecemeal measures introduced on foot of the first and second Bacon reports. For example, to change densities without making public provision for space is to give an additional windfall to the person who is speculating on the site already. People who advise high density development in one part of the country need to look at whether the argument is suitable in another part. In every city and town in Europe people have opted for higher density development where there was provision for public parks and where public recreational and amenity space was developed as opposed to the kind of aggregated small bits and pieces to which we have become used. Let those who are advising higher density development compare like with like properly as it is done in Europe.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious, it will take on board the proposals of the independent commission chaired by Professor Drudy. These begin with a simple recommendation, that local authorities must have the right to establish land banks to enable them to begin to put an end to the present situation where more and more people are being driven into virtual slavery, in terms of the proportion of their income which they must sacrifice, to meet the basic needs of shelter.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill of principle. Let the Government accept it in principle on Second Stage. Let it state how it will amend it, but let it not vote it down without knowing that if it does so, it will be on the side of the rogue builder and against blackguards in dozens of estates throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Ryan on introducing the Bill. Like Deputy Higgins, I hope the Government will be in a position to accept it because we are trying to properly regulate the construction of housing. No doubt a huge amount of money is being made in house building and development by a relatively small number of people. If we do not regulate the market in this way, we are allowing people to make extra money on the backs of ordinary home buyers who are simply trying to make a home for themselves at a reasonable cost. This means that good builders and developers who properly finish houses and estates are in competition with those who do not. It makes sense to regulate this as carefully and closely as possible so that local authorities may ensure that houses and estates are properly finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> My colleagues indicated that people in all parts of the country are suffering. They come to their local representatives having bought a house in good faith. Having seen the planning application and the conditions under which planning permission was given, they must go back and forth between the residents' association, members of the local authority, local Deputies, the local authority and the builder to try to get what was meant to be provided initially according to the regulations. This is a huge waste of time. It is a great worry for people and it is costly. We are simply trying to ensure that there are regulations in place and that they may be implemented by local authorities in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>In buying a home the consumer is probably making the biggest purchase of his or her life. We offer protection to consumers in many other areas which involve relatively small purchases in comparison to buying a home, yet in respect of that central purchase people must constantly lobby their local authorities to have this work done.</P>
    <P>This Bill is well laid out to ensure this matter is properly regulated so that rogue builders may not proceed to develop another estate without having properly finished a previous one. It seems entirely logical and it makes a great deal of sense to the ordinary person buying a home and to people on this side of the House. We simply ask the Government to accept this Bill, which will make a big difference to a huge number of ordinary people.</P>

      <P>I condemn in the strongest possible terms unfinished estates and the builders who fail in their duty to ensure housing estates are properly completed. House purchasers are entitled to expect that the basic infrastructure of roads and footpaths are properly finished and that open spaces are properly landscaped and cleaned up.</P>
      <P>Turning to Deputy Ryan's Bill, I sympathise with his objective as I am sure all Deputies have come across the problem of unfinished housing estates from time to time. From my own experience as a member of Cork Corporation, I recall estates which were left unfinished and in very unsatisfactory condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning system has a critical role in ensuring that developers meet their obligations in these respects. As the Deputy is aware, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, intends publishing a planning and development Bill to reform and consolidate the Planning Acts by mid year. In that Bill he will bring forward the Government's proposals for dealing with the problems arising from unfinished <Col N="687" /> housing estates. As the Deputy is aware, I cannot pre-empt the publication of the Bill by going into its details. However, I assure the Deputy that it will deal comprehensively with the planning system from development plan stage to planning permissions to enforcement. It is also intended that the Bill will introduce important measures dealing with older estates which have been neglected for years and which Deputy Ryan's Bill will not address. Indeed, he has failed to address the most fundamental problem with unfinished estates as it is agreed that the main problem relates to those older estates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It also relates to modern estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the Bill will, of course, be one more example of the Government honouring the commitments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium which stated that &ldquo;it is now time to start the process of updating and consolidating our planning laws to prepare for the challenges of the new millennium&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no doubt but that the minority of builders who leave estates unfinished do a disservice to their trade. The construction industry is a very important part of the economy and its output now accounts for around 20 per cent of GDP. It is unfortunate that such a major industry, in particular the house building sector, is being tarnished in the public mind by builders who operate on a &ldquo;fly by night&rdquo; basis and leave estates with unfinished roads, lighting and public areas. Such estates are a hazard to the safety of the adults and children living on them and seriously detract from the quality of life of residents.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt that builders themselves carry primary responsibility for these matters. I believe, however, that bodies such as the CIF and the Irish Home Builders' Association have a role to play in regulating the conduct of builders. It is in the interests of the building industry that the public has confidence that builders will complete developments to the satisfaction of their clients. In this regard, I would particularly ask HomeBond whether they should continue to register builders who fail in their duty to properly finish estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the strategic review of the construction industry which was published in June 1997 recommended that there should be a registration scheme for contractors in the building industry to ensure consumer protection, quality, health and safety and efficiency in the industry. These proposals are being considered by the Forum for the Construction Industry which is charged with overseeing the detailed implementation of the report. I trust the forum will bring forward proposals on this in due course. The report, entitled &ldquo;Building Our Future Together&rdquo;, also recommended the introduction of a national physical development bond scheme with the fun<Col N="688" /> damental aim of guaranteeing the proper finishing of developments. I understand that draft proposals have been circulated for comment and I would hope that the forum will be able to reach agreement on a land scheme later this year.</P>
    <P>One element in the Government's &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo; is the increasing of residential densities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently issued planning guidelines on increasing residential densities for public consultation. Increased densities can deliver an increased supply of housing from existing land and infrastructure and make more economic use of future infrastructure.</P>
    <P>High quality design is essential in the context of increased density. Higher densities demand better design finishes and amenities to give residents a high quality living environment. Developers have been given fair warning of the standards local authorities will be requiring in planning applications. The finish of estates, including roads, public open space and the arrangements for managing open space, will be of paramount importance in securing public acceptance of higher densities. There can be no question of developers leaving such schemes unfinished.</P>
    <P>Many of the unfinished estate problems arose from older permissions granted without laying down proper stringent conditions. Under section 26(2)(e) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, conditions may be imposed on granting a planning permission requiring the giving of security for satisfactory completion of the proposed development. The development control advice and guidelines, published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in October 1982, dealt comprehensively with this issue. The guidelines emphasised the need for adequate security to enable local authorities to complete the necessary works to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer. The advice has in general been followed and the use of bonds by local authorities has been shown to have been generally effective.</P>
    <P>The Department's advice to local authorities has also emphasised the scope for attaching conditions regarding the phasing of housing estates as a means of avoiding the problem of unfinished estates. This advice was backed up by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1990, which provided for the inclusion in planning permissions of conditions, without attracting compensation, relating to the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The Bill before us contains five provisions. Section 3 (a) amends section 25 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to enable the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make regulations requiring applicants for planning permission to submit information to the planning authority regarding previous developments carried out by that applicant or by a connected person. This provision aims to provide the planning authority with the record of the applicant and connected persons when that authority considers subsequent applications.</P>
    <P>The second provision provides that the planning authority may have regard to any information furnished to it in relation to the history of the applicant when dealing with the application. The planning authority can consider that information as part of the assessment of the application and refuse permission where the authority considers there is a real and substantial risk that the development would not be carried out in a reasonable time and in accordance with any conditions which might have been laid down. This second provision introduces a fairly significant new concept to planning legislation, that a local authority should refuse to grant permission when the authority is satisfied that the conditions would not be fully complied with. This could have wide implications which need to be carefully considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Implications for whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4(1) sets out conditions to which a grant of planning permission can be made subject. The first requires the applicant to enter into a bond guaranteeing that the development will be carried out and completed within a specific period of time and in accordance with all the conditions attached to the permission. It is not clear to me that this is in effect an extension of the provisions contained in section 26(2)(e) of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 4(1)(b) enables a local authority to require a developer to make a financial contribution towards the provision of facilities such as buildings, parks, recreation facilities and open spaces for the benefit of the community. Local authorities already have the power to seek a contribution towards the provision of open spaces. The forthcoming Bill will bring forward new proposals on contributions.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides that a developer and other persons involved in the direction and management of funding of the development owe a duty of care to those who become residents in the proposed estate, to ensure that the development is carried out and completed in accordance with all the conditions of the grant of permission. Section 5(2) states that a person who suffers loss or damage by reason of the failure or refusal of another person to comply with this duty of care can take an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in like manner as any other action in tort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> As the law stands, a person who does not comply with a condition of permission is guilty of an offence. In addition, under section 27 of the Planning and Development Act, 1976, any person may seek a High Court or Circuit Court injunction seeking that development be carried out in conformity with the planning permission. The provision in Deputy Ryan's Bill does not add to the existing law.</P>
    <P>The solutions put forward in this Bill, especially sections 3 and 5, pose complex legal questions. The Bill raises significant issues related to planning and company law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, while the definition of &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; from the Ethics in Public Office Act may be suitable in the context of disclosure of interests, it may not be a suitable base for making decisions on planning applications. Could the brother or sister of a rogue developer be held accountable for that brother or sister's past failure where the two companies are unconnected? I acknowledge the perception that problems arise from the practice of setting up separate companies for each development. Although the principals of the companies are the same people, the companies are separate legal entities. In looking at these issues we will need to consider if the extensive provisions of the Companies Acts on reckless trading and the disqualification of directors are of relevance.</P>
      <P>It could be easy to circumvent the proposals as land can be held in the name of company A and the applicant for planning permission can be in the name of company B. However, the real developer is company C which had been in breach of previous planning permissions. Once company B obtains planning permission, it can transfer the same to company C.</P>
      <P>Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála will have to ensure that the principles of natural justice are not infringed when deciding that it is reasonbale to infer &ldquo;that the development in respect of which permission is sought would not be carried out and completed within a reasonable period of time and in accordance with any conditions to which it might be subject&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed examination of the constitutionality of this proposal is needed as any blanket right to refuse permission on the basis of a previous breach of any planning condition could constitute an unjustified attack on a person's constitutional <Col N="691" /> rights. Section 5 also raises substantial legal issues which need careful consideration.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the main problems relate to older estates and it does not appear that any new legislation can do much for them as there is a limit to what can be done by way of retrospective legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan does not attempt in the Bill to deal with the problem of older estates. It would only apply to planning applications received by planning authorities after the Bill is enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution lies in planning permission which has all necessary conditions attached and which is enforced by the local authority. The provision of an adequate bond also means that where a local authority must finish an estate, there would be sufficient moneys to meet the costs of the works.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan's Bill is well intentioned and I sympathise with his objective. His Bill, however, is a piecemeal approach to solving this problem. I am convinced that the problems of unfinished estates can best be dealt with in the context of the comprehensive review of planning legislation which is close to finalisation. Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Department and the Office of the Attorney General are all working hard to ensure that we can bring forward a Bill which will give us a better planning system, one that will cope with our changing times.</P>
      <P>The issues which Deputy Ryan raised today and previously in the Seanad are being addressed seriously so we can come forward with effective solutions. I share his frustration with estates being left unfinished for many years but, as I have explained, the present planning code ensures that adequate bonds can be lodged with the planning authorities to ensure that estates are finished. A proper enforcement of planning and the use of bonds has meant that estates built in recent years have generally been finished and taken in charge.</P>
      <P>The problem, as Deputy Ryan recognised, relates to older estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>However, this Bill does nothing for existing estates. This Government will ensure that the issue of existing estates will be comprehensively tackled. The Government Bill will also contain major reforms to planning enforcement controls in general. While Deputy Ryan's Bill is worthy, it will not deal comprehensively with the issues which concern him. The proposed Government Bill will deal with a num<Col N="692" /> ber of other points raised by the Deputy, including the issue of the provision of community and social facilities.</P>
      <P>I agree that introducing higher density housing development requires top quality design. The draft housing density guidelines which my Department has published recognise this aspect as critical to the concept of higher density development. My Department recently held a number of seminars with local authorities and has stressed the importance of this issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan mentioned the problem of estates being built in stages. The present law allows for the phasing of development to ensure that each phase is completed before the next phase commences. It is a matter for the local authority to properly enforce the powers it already has. The proposal will not alter that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins pointed out the difficulty in dealing with builders who change company names each time they propose a development. This type of evasion makes it very difficult to take the past record of the builder into consideration. The answer for estates which are being developed is to require an adequate bond to ensure that the estate can be finished to the full extent. The historical problems cited by Deputy Higgins will not be resolved by this Bill but will be tackled by the Government in the Bill it will publish shortly.</P>
      <P>When the Bill is published in the summer, Deputies will agree that the Government has endeavoured to address the issues raised today. Given that this comprehensive planning reform Bill will shortly be before the House, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his Bill.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Ryan for publishing this Bill. Like the Minister I sympathise with his objectives. As public representatives we are all aware of the difficulties faced by constituents when estates are not finished, particularly with roads, footpaths and lighting.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Member of this House, every Government and political party has said in an election manifesto that local authorities will take over estates which are not finished. Our manifesto in 1977 set out such a proposal. The same issue comes up in every election and it is relevant to what the Minister of State Deputy Wallace said about older estates. At that time fly by night builders were working and bonds were not available to local authorities, denying them the opportunity to use that money to complete the estates. I hope the CIF will play a more active role and that use will be made of home bond because the bodies mentioned are important. To be fair to the construction industry, a more enlightened approach is being taken and there are stricter guidelines on planning permission at the start of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Minister of State, I look forward to the planning and development Bill which will be <Col N="693" /> introduced in the House by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. I hope it will deal with the issues we have discussed and which Deputy Ryan has highlighted.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk on the part of the Minister and in the media about high density building as a solution to the problems of estates and planning and development. I represent a mostly rural area and high density building is being put forward as a quick fix solution. In housing estates in smaller towns, one access road is used for different phases of building and that can lead to a great deal of disruption and hardship for the people living in the first phase of the estate. Phasing in developments is not a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Deputy Higgins referred to the question of companies changing their names. That is an issue not just in relation to building but in the whole area of company law in that, by simply changing its name, a company can set up in business again with the same personnel. That is an issue across the business world, not just in the housing area. Hopefully the Government will investigate that matter further in terms of what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the difficulties for local authorities because it is the function of local authorities to deal with estates that are not completed. We know that a bond must be taken out and while the position has certainly improved, there is a serious problem with some of the older estates. I feel sorry for families with young children living in estates where play areas are not completed and real frustration is being experienced. In addition, there are problems in some local authority areas with the safety of playground equipment, insurance and so on. That is a nightmare for the people who have to address the problem.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on the planning and development Bill when it is published.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, that the principles of natural justice to which he alluded do not apply to home owners because, once again, the Government, in response to this excellent proposal from Deputy Ryan, has dodged the central issue behind this Bill. As most Members of the House will be aware, the Bill, in a modified form, was first introduced by the then Senator Ryan in Seanad Éireann in November 1997. It was fascinating to listen to the contribution of the Minister of State tonight&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;by comparison with the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in November 1997. The script has not changed. There is no change in the Government's position and I would encourage it to think long and hard before it comes into the House in response to Private Members' time, whether it is legislation of this kind or motions, and get its act together. If we refer back to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in the Seanad on 19 November 1997 on the then Senator Ryan's Bill, the same arguments are rehearsed but there is no advancement of the intent of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill and it should be supported on all sides of the House. Every Member of the House agrees with and supports its principles and, as Deputy Higgins said in his contribution, if the Minister has substantive difficulty with certain aspects of the Bill &ndash; I have questions about some aspects of it &ndash; let us put it to the committee. That is the reason we have committees of the Dáil. We are not here to railroad legislation through the House at the whim of the Executive. All 166 Members of the House have rights in terms of putting Bills of this nature to the Dáil. It is not just the prerogative of the Executive to determine at its will which Bills it chooses to accept or reject. That is the reason we have a committee system.</P>
      <P>There was no major opposition in the Minister of State's contribution to many of the sections in the Bill because he and the Government have a proud hands-off record when it comes to the construction industry. That was evident last autumn when we dealt with the gazumping issue. I had the privilege of introducing the home purchase anti-gazumping Bill and the same spurious constitutional arguments were made then, that the Bill could not be accepted because it was fraught with constitutional difficulties. That is hogwash. If the will existed to address the problem of gazumping, the Bill would have been accepted. If the will existed on the opposite side of the House to take on a small element of the construction industry, we could easily deal with this matter by way of legislative change, in particular by way of a debate on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, the will does not exist and for whatever reason the Government does not want to take on a certain rogue element in the industry.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister of State to simply rehearse the arguments his senior colleague made in 1997.</P>

      <P>In the Seanad debate in 1997, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said that when the national convention, the convention established to consider the issue of planning, was over, it was his intention to complete the review as quickly as possible and to bring forward legislation. That was November 1997 and it is now May 1999. Where is the legislation? Once again the Minister of State has told us it is on the way but when will we see it? Why was this legislation not introduced <Col N="695" /> earlier? The national convention has long since passed and the Minister has not acted quickly as he told Senators he would in 1997. There has been consistent foot dragging on the part of the Government on this issue.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill and Deputy Ryan should be congratulated on the manner in which he has attempted to change the law in this area. In opposing the Bill, one of the central arguments put forward by the Minister of State was that because the Bill does not deal in a retrospective way with older estates, we should not be concerned about it. I represent a constituency in which the bulk of housing development took place in the past ten to 15 years. I consistently come across developments which are two or three years old in which basic standards have still not been adhered to &ndash; streetlights not working, dubious pavements, and large mounds which are supposed to be open spaces left in an appalling condition. This Bill does not just deal with older estates. It deals with the future as we are setting down basic consumer protections for the purchase of a house &ndash; the most fundamental transaction in which any family will ever be involved.</P>
      <P>Why is it that people feel they do not have the same consumer protection rights when they buy a house as when they purchase a car or a holiday? Why does that basic consumer protection not exist with regard to the purchase of a home? That loophole is addressed in the Bill and that is why the Bill should be supported.</P>
      <P>It is not a case of arguing that this concerns only estates built 25 or 30 years ago. The taking in charge lists of local authorities are growing every day. South Dublin County Council has five categories of housing developments set aside for taking in charge. Many of these developments will be taken in charge in three or four years but this is not good enough when people are making such a massive investment.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State repeated the comments he made in 1997 when he encouraged the Irish Home Builders' Association and HomeBond to establish a register. What has he done about this? He gave the same line in the Seanad in 1997. Why is he saying the same thing in May 1999? What discussions has he had with the Irish Home Builders' Association about establishing a register?</P>

      <P>The people will have their say in a few weeks and the Deputy will have nothing more to say about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister raised a number of arguments concerning section 3, particularly section 3(b). His argument is that one could not have a situation where, in order to obtain planning permission, local authorities would have to trawl the developer's record before determining whether they were fit to build houses. I accept the Minister of State's argument on this issue. I would have proposed recasting this subsection so that the local authority would accept the planning application but would stipulate a time-frame in the permission whereby one could not build for one or two years after this date until all the commitments undertaken to the authority were adhered to. That is the kind of amendment possible on Committee Stage and why the Government is wrong to vote against the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are living in a time of high house price inflation &ndash; prices have increased by 50 per cent or 60 per cent over the past three years. Housing output has dramatically increased as a result of the demand for houses due to demographic changes. There is a need for clearly thought-out consumer protection legislation to ensure that people who purchase a home know what they are getting for their money, that they will not have to chase developers, councillors or residents associations and that all aspects of the planning permission are implemented.</P>
      <P>The Government is wrong to vote down this Bill and to proceed on a course of action which will fly in the face of hundreds of thousands of young couples who have purchased their homes and ensured that the mortgage, which accounts for a substantial amount of their income, has to be paid. The Government should think again about this Bill. It should put it to the appropriate committee of the House so that it can be teased out to ensure proper consumer protection can be provided for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will tackle a growing problem in urban constituencies but also, sadly, in rural counties. The current provisions regarding bonding have failed to ensure that developers complete work on estates. Developers are getting away with blue murder.</P>
      <P>There are many problems with the bonding system. The bond is fixed when planning permission is granted. By the time the council forecloses on the bond the cost of completing the work will have risen greatly and the bond will not cover the cost. Some developments drag on for years which makes the bond non-viable. We will have to consider index-linking bonds.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem that county councils are unwilling to take over the work and foreclose on the bond. Councils are dragging their heels on this issue. Roscommon County Council has never foreclosed on a bond even though there have been a number of problems with different developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Some areas consist of pre-bond estates which house an elderly population who have still not been taken over by councils. In some estates, work on footpaths, roads and public lighting has not been completed. Elderly people in these estates, some of whom are in wheelchairs, cannot afford to pay for the necessary development work from their pensions and the developer has disappeared. Most of these developers are building in some other part of the country and no control is being placed on them.</P>
    <P>Other developers have disappeared completely. I know of one case in which there was no public lighting or footpaths in an estate for ten years. The developer could not be found. Eventually the council provided funds to carry out the work but the developer was gone and there was no bond in place.</P>
    <P>There is no protection for home purchasers. This is the biggest, single investment a young couple will make. There is protection in the banking system and other sectors but there is no protection for young couples starting out in life against the developer going off and starting work on another development.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of cowboys. I will give the Minister of State one example of the type of situation with which county councils are dealing as he does not seem to be aware of the difficulties for which some of these developers are responsible. One developer built two additional houses on an estate without planning permission. He is now using the non-completion of the estate as a gun to the council's head in an effort to get planning permission to build on the green areas within the estate. He also tried to charge families for the building of a wall around the estate. Since then he has had two further developments, both of which have yet to be completed. He has already obtained planning permission for two further developments which he has started. He has still not completed the original estate and the people are involved in a vain attempt to get him to complete the work. The piers of the wall for which he was attempting to charge the young couples are falling down and there is a huge risk that one of them will fall on a child playing in the area. The so-called green area is more like a swamp in Central Africa than a green area in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is the position in which that developer has left this estate. I have spoken with him and he is not worried about it. One might as well be talking to a brick wall. He does not care about the bond. It is small money to him. He has left three estates looking like a war zone and he is not willing to complete them, yet Roscommon County Council has given him planning permission for two additional estates and there is nothing it can do about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us he will do nothing about it. He had an ideal opportunity this evening. He could have accepted this legislation and amended it if necessary. The only way to stop this type of <Col N="698" /> cowboy is to ensure he can be caught with the next planning application as suggested by Deputy Ryan or Deputy Hayes. That is the only way to control these cowboys. It is the only thing that hits their pocket. The bond is only small money to them. They do not care about it. The situation in which they have left numerous young couples throughout the country is nothing short of a disgrace.</P>

      <P>There are outflow pipes from drains and from the roadway running into rivers here, there and everywhere and there is no control whatsoever. In one estate the developer put a mains water pipe along one side and another along the other side. That means when there is a shortage of water and the water is turned off all the silt and dirt comes to the end of the street and, for the next ten or 12 days, the people in the estate have nothing but brown water. That is not acceptable in any area of the country, particularly where there is mains water. The county council has to come out and flush out the pipes using funds it should be using to upgrade rural water systems. We have no control on this type of developer.</P>
      <P>There is one such estate in Ballaghaderreen in the north of the county. The Taoiseach was there during the week opening Dillon House and it is a pity we did not bring him to see this estate. The estate in question has 20 elderly residents. Two of them are wheelchair users and they cannot use the footpath because it was not completed. The residents cannot walk down the street at night because there is no public lighting. The developer cannot be found. He has done a runner. He is probably building in some other part of the country now. These elderly people come to me and other local councillors looking for public lighting and for the footpath to be completed. The council says it is the responsibility of the developer and that until the works are completed it cannot take over the estate. All that is left is for the residents to pay money to put in the services. I would like to see the Minister ask old-age pensioners for £500 or £600 to put in a footpath and another £500 or £600 for public lighting, which should have been put in when the estate was developed. There was a development charge in place which was included in the cost of the houses. However, there was no bond in place as this happened before bonds were introduced. This type of thing is happening up and down the country. It is frustrating for councils and for county councillors. Unless we have the legislation to back us up there is nothing we can do against these cowboys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Ryan's legislation. It targets what we are looking for, but the Minister is not willing to accept it. He should look again at this legislation, before his colleagues come in here <Col N="699" /> tomorrow night, to see if there is any way he can accept it. It is crucially important for those young couples and for other young people who pay up to £120,000 or £140,000 for a house in Dublin and £70,000 or £80,000 in any rural county only to find that the developer has gone on to flog another 40 or 50 houses, making huge profits, and they are left high and dry with nothing they can do about it. It is infuriating that these builders can put in a further application for planning permission. After causing problems for 20 or 30 young couples, perhaps with young children, they can do the same thing to another 20 or 30 families in another part of the county or in the next estate.</P>
    <P>This is what we are dealing with and nothing is being done about it. The Minister talks about promised legislation but we have seen the delays there are in bringing legislation to this House.</P>

He asked me what we could do. I told him we could foreclose on his bond. He said that is only &ldquo;Mickey Mouse&rdquo; money, that he would make that in another couple of months and that he was not concerned about that. That is the man who built two extra houses in an estate and it took council officials two more years to discover that. That is what we are trying to deal with. However, the council's hands are tied in trying to target these cowboys, to root them out, make sure they get out of the county and out of the country and go somewhere else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this vital matter. Junior hospital doctors are working under conditions and for hours which give rise to grave concern about the protection of the doctors themselves and, most particularly, about the protection of their patients. The European directive on working time was adopted in 1993. It allowed for certain exceptions, although there was not an onus on member states to make any. One of the exceptions was for doctors in training.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the Organisation of Working Time Act was incorporated into Irish law. That Act exempts doctors in training from all provisions of the Act, including rest breaks, night work and total overall working time limits. This means that doctors can, and do, end up working an intolerable number of hours. There is evidence of doctors working up to, and even over, 100 hours per week. Regularly, junior hospital doctors do not get proper coffee breaks or a chance to eat their lunch. They may head into a day's work, having been on call the night before following a day's work and having had only two hours sleep. If they want to take a holiday they must make reciprocal arrangements with colleagues by providing cover for them. If someone is sick, another doctor must fill the gap.</P>
      <P>The current lack of exemption from protection for these doctors is totally unacceptable and poses an unjustifiable risk to patients. It is only a matter of time before a major medical error is made by some unfortunate junior hospital doctor suffering from exhaustion. That is the nightmare junior doctors are conscious of on a daily basis and one which must be addressed within the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that any worker, particularly workers who are dealing with matters of life and death, should be deprived of their legal right to rest breaks and working time limits. We do not make the demands on lorry drivers or factory workers that we currently make on junior hospital doctors manning our acute hospital services.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister will say in his reply that the matter of the NCHD working hours is dealt with in the general agreement negotiated between the IMO and health employers, which limits work to 65 hours, save in exceptional circumstances. However, it is quite clear this agreement is totally inadequate. The exceptional circumstances let-out has been grossly abused. It must be remembered that this agreement has no legal backing and there are no legal remedies as exist under the Working Time Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is a tradition in the hospital service of junior doctors working long hours, conditions are very different today and are more pressurised, <Col N="701" /> demanding and open to litigation than ever before. We have a system in our public acute hospital service that is near breaking point. Junior hospital doctors are working at the coalface all the time. They staff the accident and emergency units and cope with the full range of health demands. Although they are still in training, they are expected to carry a ferocious burden of work and responsibility. That they do so with such skill and dependability is a great credit to themselves and their training.</P>
    <P>In November 1998 the EU Commission published a proposed revised directive. This would limit junior doctors to 48 hours, from a seven year lead in period during which the hours could be negotiated up to 54 hours per week. It is now clear the British Government is trying to water down the directive, with a prolonged lead in period of 11 years or longer and reduced protection for doctors and patients. There have been worrying indications that the Irish Government has been supportive of the British approach. Despite repeated calls from junior doctors and the IMO, there has been no public statement from the Government on its position. We are in the dark.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in the House because it is vital the Government makes a clear, unambiguous statement on the EU draft directive and pledges its commitment to resist any attempt at dilution from any quarter. In raising this issue, I am urging the Minister to declare that the injustice being meted out to junior hospital doctors and the risks inherent for patient care will be tackled without undue delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and allowing me the opportunity of clarifying the Government's position on the issue. There have been several highly inaccurate reports in the Irish and British media on Ireland's position on the inclusion of junior doctors in the working time directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> The Deputy will be aware that trainee doctors, along with several other groups, were excluded from the provisions of the original working time directive adopted by the EU in 1993. Following adoption of the 1993 directive, the European Commission embarked on a consultative exercise with the sectors concerned and the member states on how a broadly similar level of protection to that provided by the 1993 directive could be afforded to the excluded groups, while taking account of the specific requirements of the industries and services concerned. In the case of hospitals, this involved attempting to balance the need for reasonable working hours for doctors, while recognising the 24 hour nature of hospital services, and the need to guarantee continuity of care for patients. In Ireland's case, we needed a framework which would allow us to move from our present position of having a maximum working week of 65 hours for junior doctors to the 48 hours contained in the 1993 directive. We have never disputed the need to move towards 48 hours per week as a maximum. We simply wanted to achieve this in a manner which would not endanger patients and which would not throw the entire medical workforce career structure into chaos by recruiting large numbers of trainee doctors for whom there would be no reasonable prospect of securing career posts. The Deputy will be aware that the future structure of the hospital medical hierarchy is already being looked at by the Medical Manpower Forum.</P>
    <P>The European Commission published its proposals for an amending directive to the 1993 directive in November 1998. The Commission proposed a transition period for junior doctors of seven years from the date of adoption of the new directive. During this period the maximum permitted working week would be 54 hours. We regarded this proposal as unrealistic and not capable of being achieved. I have to point out to the House that European directives have the force of law and are not aspirational. We should not agree to proposals which we cannot implement and adhere to. The Commission's proposals have been the subject of discussion in a social questions working group under the aegis of the Labour and Social Affairs Council. Several member states have expressed dissatisfaction with the Commission's proposals. In an effort to secure a consensus on a proposal to be put to the Council, the German Presidency has brought forward a series of compromise proposals. The latest proposal envisages a total transition period of 11 years from adoption of the directive. Member states would have three years to implement the directive in law. For the remaining eight years, doctors would have a maximum working week of 60 hours for the first two years, 56 hours for the following two years and 52 hours for the remaining four years, with 48 hours being reached at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> Ireland did not support the UK Labour Government's proposal for a 15 year transition period, although we understood the reasons it sought this concession. We will fully implement whatever measures are adopted by the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for missing my allocated time slot. I am obliged to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for debate.</P>
      <P>The budget day announcement that the community employment programme was to be reduced by 2,500 places has begun to cause serious grief around the country, especially in the poorer urban areas. Worthwhile projects are being damaged and some threatened with termination. Little regard is being had for the social dimension of many of the schemes. Participants are being sent back into the unemployment queue without the necessary training. Many have been very long-term unemployed and it is completely unrealistic to expect the CE scheme to have succeeded in six months where the education system failed over ten to 12 years.</P>
      <P>The position up to now permitted the retention of a proportion of the over 35s for more than one year. The manner of implementation of the Government cuts has now terminated that option. This very often excludes participants least equipped for the modern day workforce &ndash; people out of the workplace for a long time, people with little formal education and, in many cases, with low self-esteem.</P>
      <P>The typical part-time course over 12 months means that such people remain in most cases unequipped for today's typical employment. Therefore, we are only aggravating their frustration if they are to return to the unemployment queues.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I heard at first hand from a couple of dozen supervisors working in the Crumlin area their frustration that, despite their experience at the coalface, they have not been consulted about the changes taking place. This is all happening on the ground in advance of the Government making a decision on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the future shape of CE.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt, of course, but that some of the panic on the ground is because there are no evident plans by Government to substitute the core functions being carried out by many CE participants. For instance, how many school principals around the country believe they will lose their school caretaker or classroom assistant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If projects undertaking meritorious environmental work are threatened, are there plans to enable local authorities to perform this work? What is to happen to the many community arts projects that rely on CE participants? Worthwhile child care projects may be threatened, yet <Col N="704" /> the State has no alternative plans. Most of all, it is the impact of the new rules on individuals' self-confidence that is at issue.</P>
    <P>If the Government is contemplating significant changes to the community employment programme &ndash; as distinct from changes on the basis of financial considerations &ndash; then the Tánaiste should set out her thinking. There ought to be provision for proper consultation with the sponsors and participants. There is a special case to be made in respect of meritorious projects in seriously disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Government must clarify which core functions will be funded in the orthodox fashion in future and, second, if it is prepared to put additional investment into the specialised training needs of the long-term unemployed, including CE participants.</P>
    <P>Earlier, my colleague Deputy Wall handed me a letter from Pastor Robert Dunlop who had written to him in distress that he is losing the CE scheme that was responsible for the upkeep of his church. That is typical of what colleagues on all sides of the House will be experiencing all around the country. I look forward to the Minister explaining what direction CE is taking. He should commit himself to consulting with the people who are working at the coalface.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of clarifying the Government's position on this matter. I am aware of the issues the Deputy has raised personally with the Tánaiste. In addition, I have received representations from many Members of this House, particularly members of my own party, on this issue.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is as a transitional programme to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. Community employment has operated at a level of around 40,000 participants for several years. The appropriateness of maintaining participation at this level, at a time of increasing tightening in the labour market, has been under consideration for some time and was specifically addressed in the recent Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluation of the programme.</P>
      <P>That report recommended that the participation level should be reduced on a phased basis by 6,000 to 8,000 places. It also recommended a number of other reforms aimed generally at improving the targeting and outcomes of community employment. This year there has been a modest reduction in the number of places on community employment, from a level approaching 40,000 at end 1998 to an average of 37,500 in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report was not merely about the size of the community employ<Col N="705" /> ment programme but about the degree to which it was effectively targeted at those at greatest disadvantage in the labour market, and about the quality of training, development and progression supports for participants. It is the Government's intention to proceed with a menu of reforms to community employment, having regard to the Deloitte &amp; Touche recommendations, and on foot of consultation with the social partners. There has already been a degree of discussion on the future of CE at official level with the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000 and a consultative group on labour market measures has been set up under Partnership 2000, which is discussing proposed changes to CE in a structured way. That group has nearly completed its work.</P>
    <P>There are two main reasons for the reduction in the number of community employment places this year. There is currently dynamic job growth in the economy, with a good proportion of new jobs going to unemployed and long-term unemployed persons. The November 1998 quarterly national household survey showed a drop in unemployment, year on year, of 33,000. This trend is reinforced by short-term figures. The live register at end-April 1999 stands at 199,000 &ndash; down 33,000 on the April 1998 figure. So the number of unemployed and long-term unemployed persons is declining, even as the workforce grows.</P>
    <P>Several studies, including the most recent by Deloite &amp; Touche, show that unemployed persons benefit more from programmes more closely linked to the labour market. Consequently, in the Estimates and budget this year we have created an additional 10,000 places at a 1999 cost of £22 million, more directly linked to mainstream FÁS training, and from which participants stand a better chance of getting a job. The Estimates provision for the community employment programme is £308 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is completing discussions at official level with the social partners on the reform of community employment. I would like to stress that community employment is and will continue to be a very substantial active labour market programme, but we want to target it more and more at the most disadvantaged in their attempts to re-enter the labour market.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that a reduction in the size of the CE programme takes place in the context of a dynamic labour market where the rate of unemployment has fallen to 6.8 per cent and the long-term unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9 per cent. We are also implementing a twin track strategy of trying to prevent long-term unemployment while proactively assisting long-term unemployed persons to get jobs.</P>
    <P>The results from the preventative strategy to stop persons falling into long-term employment <Col N="706" /> are very positive. Of the first cohort of 18-25 year olds approaching six months on the live register, who were referred to FÁS for a guidance interview in September 1998, 80 per cent had left the live register at end-March 1999. Of the 6,010 persons referred to at end-March 3,586, or 60 per cent, had been interviewed by FÁS. Of these, 1,343 were placed by FÁS &ndash; the majority in jobs and the remainder in training or education.</P>
    <P>The preventative strategy is being extended on a phased basis to 18-25 year olds who have been 18 months on the live register, with effect from March 1999, and to 25-34 year olds who have been 12 months on the live register, with effect from May 1999.</P>
    <P>Alongside the preventative strategy we are, overall, bringing a much more targeted and strategic focus to the provision of active labour market programme places through targeted measures to tackle long-term unemployment. These include the development of a dedicated social economy programme; expansion of the local employment service and reorganisation of the employment services to ensure optimal delivery of appropriate supports to the unemployed and socially excluded via FÁS and the LES network; implementation of the FÁS positive action programme on training for the long-term unemployed to substantially increase the proportion of unemployed persons in mainstream FÁS training programmes; enhancing the incentive for persons who are long-term unemployed to participate in training by increasing the weekly top up payment on the training allowance to £25; extension of jobs clubs to provide support for unemployed and long-term unemployed persons who are ready to enter the job market; extension of specific skills places and the development of bridging programmes to allow persons who are long-term unemployed to access mainstream FÁS training.</P>
    <P>A secondary objective of the community employment programme is to support the community and statutory sector, and the programme will continue to do this. Any reduction in the number of participants is a matter for FÁS. In making such reductions they will have regard to the quality of the programme for participants and to local needs.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the reduction in the numbers of persons on community employment programmes, it is the Government's intention to introduce a dedicated social economy programme later this year. I know this is an important issue and one raised by Deputy Rabbitte. The social economy programme is being introduced on foot of agreement between the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000. It is intended to support the development and regeneration of disadvantaged communities. The dedicated social economy programme will have a budget of £40 million when fully operational. It will complement community employment but will provide <Col N="707" /> a good deal more flexibility for organisations making use of it. Within community employment there has always been a tension between the interest of the participant in progressing to open labour market employment and the interest of the sponsor in continuity of staffing and service. As the focus of the social economy programme is primarily community regeneration and development it should more closely match sponsor needs.</P>
    <P>The overall objective in reforming the community employment programme is to have a smaller programme more focussed on older persons with less of the carousel effect whereby people alternate periods of employment on CE with periods when they return to the live register and with greater progression supports to help participants move on to open labour market jobs or to skills training if appropriate. The reduction in the number of places will impact on sponsor activity but to an extent the development of the social economy programme will address needs here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is total confusion on the implementation of the new rules governing turf cutting on SAC bogs and there is wholesale opposition from bog owners to the Department directive which provides that each bog owner must seek a permit to cut his or her domestic supply of turf. Many bog owners see this as a gross violation of their property rights and feel that their constitutional entitlements are being trampled upon.</P>
      <P>A number of technical questions were asked by the SAC Alliance, which is a group that co-ordinates the activities of all the bogs of Ireland. That group feels it is getting very poor information, if any, from the Department of Agriculture and Food, which is leading to all sorts of misunderstandings. I accept that there have been major changes in the sense that bog owners will be allowed to cut for ten more years on their own property in certain conditions. However, many of their questions have not been answered by the Department, such as the matter of compensation to be paid to bog owners who traditionally sold turf to supplement their income. I know a number of people whose income would come primarily from the sale of turf just as others depend on crops of barley or wheat. With the restrictions placed on SAC areas only their domestic supplies of turf can be cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked Department officials to let me know the exact details of compensation. Would audited accounts of the amounts lost be necessary? How many years could these people expect to be compensated for? It is not enough to compensate them for this year and next, as many of them would have continued to cut turf all their <Col N="708" /> lives. This matter has not been answered to anyone's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>In the case of farmers owning bog plots within a SAC area and who are also in the REP scheme, are they allowed to cut turf even with a permit? If, according to the regulations, they inadvertently cut turf and were then barred from receipt of their REPS payments, it would be a huge penalty for a small matter.</P>
    <P>The permit issue is another problem. The gobbledygook of the Department refers to permits but the wildlife rangers give the impression &ndash; and I have no reason not to believe them &ndash; that all bog owners need do is write a note to them to the effect that they are cutting their own supply of turf. They feel that will suffice but I get a different story when I ring the Department. The Minister should clarify this matter as it is creating huge problems. It is quite foreign to owners of bog plots to have to seek a permit.</P>
    <P>I understand that public notices were placed in the newspapers outlining various schemes and the SAC Alliance claims it requested the Minister to withdraw those notices to give time for further consultation. What is the Department's reaction to that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>Under Statutory Instrument no. 94 of 1997, made under the European Communities Act, 1972, and in accordance with the obligations inherent in the Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992, the Habitats Directive, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has an obligation to protect, among others, habitats of raised bog, cutaway bog and bog woodland which have been proposed as special areas of conservation.</P>
      <P>Raised bogs, in particular, are very rare in a European context. Ireland has the best examples of active, i.e. still growing, raised bogs in all of Europe. We are therefore under great pressure to preserve these habitats, which are regarded as priority sites. To preserve these bogs it is necessary to cease turf cutting, as cutting, along with the associated drainage works, will eventually dry out the entire bog. The Ministers are conscious of the social and economic impact immediate cessation would have on small communities and have decided to make exceptional arrangements in the case of cutters for domestic use. These cutters will accordingly be given a period of up to ten years to make new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to compensate cutters for the losses resulting from this activity, a series of consultations with the farming organisations and the bog alliance group was instigated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and the Minister of State at her Department. In spite of protracted negotiations and great effort from all sides, a consensus was not reached on the amounts of compensation which should be paid. The Ministers therefore decided to make an offer <Col N="709" /> based on current prices for similar land. Details of the compensation scheme were released to the press by the Minister and Minister of State. The main elements of the scheme relating to raised bogs are: £1,300 per acre for outright purchase of the bog; £ 1,100 per acre for purchase of turbary rights; a bonus of £1,000 to be paid to those who have been cutting regularly for the last five years who cease cutting in a raised bog SAC permanently, before the start of the 1999 cutting season; and an offer of another plot in the area, if available, as well as a once-off payment of £500.</P>
    <P>Great interest has been shown in the scheme with many offers of sale coming in to Dúchas. This has been helped by the formation in most areas of local liaison committees. These committees are being set up for all special areas of conservation but it was decided to proceed with the raised bog areas first. The main purpose of these committees is to have a direct line of contact between Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department, and the local landowners. Dúchas has also prepared a system whereby payments can be released without delay. They are also prepared to pay the £1,000 bonus immediately to those who opt to cease cutting from this season.</P>
    <P>Both local and head office Dúchas staff are available to clarify any details where necessary. Overall from the cutters there appears to be an acceptance of the need to conserve these priority habitats and agreement to co-operate with the Department. A date of 31 May is the final date to avail of the bonus of £1,000 and most people are anxious to meet that date.</P>
    <P>Commercial cutting must stop immediately unless formal agreement has been received from the Minister. Compensation will be paid to commercial operators for actual loss of income from areas of bog owned by them. The use of &ldquo;sausage&rdquo; machines is banned on SAC bogs because of the damage done by them. Other forms of machine cutting may be allowed.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's preferred option, from a conservation point of view, would be to cease cutting immediately she is well aware of the hardship this might cause. She was, therefore, pleased to announce the option of continuing cutting for a further ten years.</P>
    <P>I trust this explains the current position regarding turf cutting in special areas of conservation. I may not have addressed all the questions posed by the Deputy but they will be brought to the Minister's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The school in question is a medium sized, rural national school at Derryoober, Woodford, County Galway. At present it is a three teacher school with a school population, on 31 September 1998, of 51 pupils, <Col N="710" /> boys and girls. On 27 April last, the principal, a young, dedicated and enthusiastic teacher, and his equally dedicated and enthusiastic assistants received notice from the Department that the school would lose a teacher from September 1999 because, at the start of the previous school year, it was two students short of the required number to maintain their current staff of three.</P>
      <P>If this withdrawal is implemented, 1 September 1999 will be a dark and dreary day at Derryoober national school. Four classes, following four different programmes and 31 children will be obliged to fit into a room measuring 19 feet by 18 feet. The teaching process will be daunting for the principal who will also have to carry out his duties as a principal. It will be impossible adequately to deliver the quality of education to which the students are now accustomed.</P>
      <P>Is this the Minister's vision for education in the many rural national schools similar to this one? In the past he has described his vision of education with all the partners working together to ensure that the children of Ireland receive an education second to none. Can he reconcile that vision with the reality of this case?</P>
      <P>In 1996 many other rural national schools were in a similar situation. Niamh Bhreathnach, then the Minister for Education, decided that, as a concession, all schools up to three students short of the required number would retain their existing teaching staff for a period of adjustment. The announcement made on Monday, 29 July 1996, stated: &ldquo;To assist primary schools prepare for the new school year, the Minister for Education today announced that all primary schools which were due to lose a teacher in September owing to falling pupil enrolments will now keep their teacher if the pupil numbers are one, two or three pupils short of the number required to retain that teacher.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science, on behalf of the staff, parents, board of management and, most importantly, the pupils, to grant this school a temporary concession for the coming year. This school, like many others in rural Ireland is in a transition period. It is difficult to see why a school with 52 pupils can have only two teachers, the same number as a school with 14 pupils. A concession for the period of transition is all that is required. Rural decline is taking place and the Minister must not be the leader of this process. The quality of education to these pupils will decline. Is this what the Minister wants? Is this his vision for education in rural Ireland? A natural adjustment will take place over a period of four or five years in many rural schools. It is important that excess staff, as they are seen by the Department, can be used to provide an improved quality of education in small rural schools during this short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Derryoober national school retain its current teaching staff at the start of the school year <Col N="711" /> of 1999 which leads into the new millennium. Let this not be the start of a cycle of rural withdrawl of education. Many initiatives have been taken in this historic school. I ask the Minister not to kill off a rural national school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for raising this issue on the Adjournment. As the Deputy may be aware the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. There is now, and has been for many years, a basic national staffing schedule which determines the teacher entitlement of each school. As such, it is not the case that decisions are taken to reduce teacher numbers, rather they follow as an automatic result of enrolment. I am sure the Deputy would agree that this is the only reasonable basis for the staffing of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that the Government has, this year, provided for the first increase in primary teacher numbers for many years. As a <Col N="712" /> result, a significant improvement in the staffing schedule is being implemented and a very large number of schools will be gaining extra staff or keeping staff they would otherwise have lost. In addition, many schools will benefit from the extension of the remedial teacher service to all schools and a range of other initiatives. In this case the enrolment in Derryoober national school on 30 September 1997 was 60 pupils, giving an authorised staffing at the school for the current year of a principal and two assistant teachers. Additionally the school has the services of a remedial teacher,</P>
    <P>The enrolment in Derryoober national school on 30 September 1998 was 52 pupils, a significant decrease of eight pupils on the previous year's enrolment. Even though the retention figure for schools of this size has been improved by the Government, this enrolment is not sufficient to allow the retention of the second assistant teacher in the school for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 May 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 62 and 80 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A full account of my visit to Indonesia and East Timor from 15 to 19 April was given in the state<Col N="714" /> ment which I made to Seanad Éireann on 22 April.</P>
    <P>In keeping with commitments which I had made to the Oireachtas over the past year, the main purpose of my visit to Jakarta and Dili was to express my solidarity with the cause of the people of East Timor. I also travelled there for the purpose of seeking the release of the resistance leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, whose outstanding qualities have made him both a force for moderation and a leading spokesman for the Timorese people in recent years.</P>
    <P>While in Jakarta, I had discussions with President Habibie, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and the Defence Minister, General Wiranto. I was pleased also that I had the opportunity to visit Xanana Gusmao who is being held under house arrest in Jakarta; I had a very worthwhile exchange of views with him on the future of East Timor.</P>
    <P>When I visited Dili on 17 April, I was horrified to find that the population of the East Timorese capital were that day being subjected to acts of intimidation and violence by armed groups of militia who were rampaging through the city. There was strong evidence to suggest that the militia groups were being aided and encouraged by the Indonesian military authorities. When I drew these violent acts to the attention of the local military commander and of the Indonesian-appointed Governor, neither appeared to make the slightest effort to intervene or to attempt to reduce the level of violence.</P>
    <P>As a result of my visit to East Timor, I was able to demonstrate unequivocably to the Indonesian authorities in Jakarta the murderous acts which were being carried out in their name. I have also been able to bring these horrific events to the attention of my EU colleagues at the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 26 April. On that occasion, the Council called on the Indonesian Government to fulfil its obligations and to disarm the militia. The Council also reiterated that a United Nations presence in East Timor was urgently needed to help prevent further violence in the territory. The establishment of a UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor can only be established, however, with the consent of the Indonesian authorities. Regrettably, Indonesian agreement to such a course of action has not been forthcoming to date.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council has furthermore invited the EU Commission to consider urgently possible appropriate measures with a view to supporting the consultation process of the East Timorese people, to be conducted by the United Nations; providing humanitarian assistance to the East Timorese people; and developing economic and social programmes to assist the East Timorese people and enhance its institution capacity-building.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to offer every appropriate support in consultation with its EU colleagues towards pursuing the aims set out above by the Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Deputies will be aware that an agreement was signed in New York on 5 May which includes arrangements for the holding of a democratic vote in East Timor on 8 August. I welcome the progress which this represents. While precise details of the arrangements remain to be clarified, it is understood that the vote will permit the East Timorese people to decide democratically on Indonesia's proposals for granting autonomy to the territory. It is hoped that this will constitute a major step in the process of allowing the Timorese people to engage freely and peacefully in a democratic act of self-determination in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Agreement was also reached in New York on the dispatch to East Timor of civilian police officers under the aegis of the United Nations to act as advisers at the time of the voting process. I believe that the earliest possible deployment of these police officers and other UN personnel is essential if the free and peaceful participation of the Timorese people in the consultative process is to be ensured. Consideration is currently being given by the Government to what contribution can be made by Ireland to the establishment of the police unit.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign for the outstanding work that they have done in recent years to ensure that the issue of East Timor has been given the attention it deserves by the members of the Oireachtas and the Irish public in general.</P>

    <P>I availed of the opportunity to emphasise our support for the peace process in Sudan.

Minister Mustafa emphasised his commitment to the peace process and to tack<Col N="716" /> ling any obstacles in respect of the provision of humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>Minister Mustafa briefed us on the declaration by the Sudanese President of a comprehensive cease-fire in Southern Sudan and of hopes for the success of the IGAD initiative for the peace process in Sudan.

    <P>It is understood that, as of now, the refugees admitted as part of the UNHCR humanitarian evacuation programme will come from camps in Macedonia. The decision to evacuate from the camps was taken by the UNHCR to relieve the pressure on the camps which are suffering from overcrowding. The UNHCR is endeavouring, as far as possible, to keep families together and I fully support this as family groups should find it easier to settle in their new environments. I would also say that the Government are committed to a programme of family reunification and refugees would be entitled to apply to have their family admitted to Ireland. The State will pay transport costs involved.</P>
    <P>The accommodation provided to the refugees is on a self-catering basis in privately owned hostels, former convents and in mobile homes in former barracks owned by the Department of Defence. The accommodation has been selected on the basis of availability, suitability for families and compliance with fire regulations. The refugees will be clustered in the various centres so that they can remain in community groups and to facilitate access to public services.</P>
    <P>Each reception centre will have its own small management team, headed by the refugee agency, which is under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The teams will consist of a manager, two to three assistants, one to two project workers (who will provide interpreter services as well as general duties), a receptionist or general office worker, and a small number of domestic and security staff. Staff will generally be on secondment from health boards. Members of the defence forces are also being seconded to the teams.</P>
    <P>A national co-ordination committee made up of departmental representatives and the refugee agency is spearheading the operation. The committee is centred at the Department of Foreign Affairs. There will also be local operations committees in each centre to oversee the centres.</P>
    <P>It is also envisaged that appropriate structures will be put in place at local level to facilitate the greatest possible degree of support and involvement by the local community and NGOs for example ICA, Macra Churches etc.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the enormous outpouring of support and welcome and offers of assistance coming from the Irish people. We are still actively seeking to identify additional accommodation. Inspection teams are busy identifying and making ready accommodation for future needs. A range of services will be made available to refugees to meet their various needs. They will take some time to become accustomed to their new environment but with the expert assistance <Col N="718" /> of the refugee agency and other officials their trauma will be assuaged. I would like to acknowledge the work of all state agencies involved in the effort to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government remains that set out in my reply of 30 March to another question  &ndash;  we wish to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners and have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the EU Common position on Cuba, adopted in December 1996, our aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from there. But the common position also makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country.</P>
      <P>After the Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 there had been a certain easing of repressive measures against political dissidents and a reduction in the number of political prisoners. However, recently the situation has deteriorated again. In January the criminal law was amended to introduce new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing dissidence.</P>
      <P>In March, four members of the internal dissidence group were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In a statement issued on 17 March, the EU expressed its deep regret at the sentences passed. It pointed out that the people convicted had exercised a freedom of expression which is recognised universally as a human right and that the EU could not accept that citizens exercising such a right should be criminalised by State authorities. The EU also rejected judicial proceedings of a political nature and expressed deep concern about amendments to the criminal law further curtailing the exercise of the rights of citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> At the same time, the EU reiterated the continuing objective in its relations with Cuba, namely to encourage a transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the common position.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights, including at the session just concluded. With all of our EU partners, we once again called on Cuba to co-operate with all the human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>
    <P>In short, Cuba must play its part if it wishes to make progress in its international relations. We look to the Cuban authorities for an improvement in the human rights situation.</P>
    <P>I am keeping under continuous review the extension of our diplomatic network, including through non-resident accreditation, to a number of countries such as Cuba. I have, of course, to take account of resource constraints. In the meantime, however, the lack of formal diplomatic relations does not inhibit the development and maintenance of normal contacts with the countries concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned by the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo which together with displacement, hunger and human rights violations is causing severe hardship for the civilian population. The involvement of neighbouring states, some of which are providing military support to the protagonists, has grave regional implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the continued lack of agreement between the conflicting parties on a cease-fire, there have been a number of encouraging developments in recent weeks. On April 7, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1234 which calls for the withdrawal of uninvited forces from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Also in early April, the UN Secretary General appointed former Senegalese Foreign Minister, Moustapha Niasse, as his special envoy to the Democratic Republic of Congo peace process. On 18 April, Colonel Gadaffi of Libya brokered the signing of an agreement in Sirte between the Presidents of <Col N="720" /> the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Chad and Eritrea. This agreement provides for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the deployment of peace-keepers, and an all-inclusive national dialogue. These elements are common to those already being proposed by the EU and other members of the international community. While Rwanda has been sceptical of the Sirte Agreement, it has been welcomed by the UN Security Council as a means of securing an immediate cessation of hostilities. The Gadaffi initiative will now have to be merged with the ongoing regional peace efforts of the Southern African development community and of President Chiluba of Zambia. The proposed national debate between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, rebels and civil society which is scheduled to take place in Nairobi in mid-May also has the potential to assist in finding a political solution to the crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government, our EU partners and other members of the international community remain committed to bringing about an immediate ceasefire as a precursor to a negotiated settlement. This should include agreed mechanisms for the withdrawal of outside military interests and for monitoring the peace to the satisfaction of all parties. While the recent Sirte Agreement contains many of these elements, it will be important to persuade the non-signatories, especially Rwanda, that any future settlement will address their security and ethnic concerns. The request by the United Nations Secretary-General for the Security Council to prepare for a possible international presence to support a peaceful settlement is also helping to build confidence.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to Africa, I had the opportunity to discuss the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo with government representatives from Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, all of whom have a direct interest in developments. During these meetings, I reiterated that Ireland and our EU partners will continue to support the regional and international peace efforts in relation to the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries of the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to support the work of the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who is actively pursuing the Unions objectives through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures. The EU continues to support the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region as a means of ensuring lasting stability.</P>

      <P>The question of effective reform of the Commission is a matter of great importance to Ireland and to all the member states of the European Union. The Commission's role in the structures of the European Union is a vital one. In the view of the Irish Government, the Commission must be in a position to exercise its prerogatives under the Treaty with the full confidence of the governments of the member states and of the other institutions of the Union.</P>
      <P>The Government fully endorses the statement by the European Council in Berlin that the new Commission should speedily put into effect the necessary reforms, in particular for the improvement of its organisation, management and financial control; that it ought to give urgent priority to launching a programme of far-reaching modernisation and reform; and that all means should be used in order to ensure that whenever community funds, programmes or projects are managed by the Commission, its services are suitably structured to ensure the highest standards of management, integrity and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Of course, the reform of the Commission cannot have as its purpose or effect any reduction of the Commission's role as established by the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the International Criminal Court provided for by the Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998 by a United Nations diplomatic conference.</P>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 79 states have signed the statute and, of these, two &ndash; Senegal and Trinidad and Tobago &ndash; have ratified the statute. Ireland signed the statute, subject to ratification, on 7 October 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court is something which Ireland has advocated for many years and the Government took an active part in the development of the court's founding statute at the Rome conference. The adoption of the court's statute was a major achievement which brings the establishment of an independent and effective International Criminal Court much closer to realisation. The court will have jurisdiction over the <Col N="722" /> most heinous crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</P>
    <P>The successful establishment of the International Criminal Court is therefore of major significance for the international community and Ireland will continue to support this endeavour by taking appropriate action to ratify the Rome statute as soon as possible, and by participating in the work of the preparatory commission set up to make the necessary arrangements to ensure the smooth functioning of the court when the statute enters into force.</P>
    <P>The first session of the commission met in New York from 16 to 26 February 1999 and two further sessions are planned from 26 July to 13 August and from 29 November to 17 December. It is likely that further sessions will be arranged for next year. Ireland was represented at the first session of the preparatory commission and it is intended that Irish representation will continue at all sessions of the commission. The purpose of the preparatory commission is to draft the Court's rules of evidence and procedure and to deal with other matters necessary for its effective operation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ratification process, I should point out that the statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 parts and 128 articles. As a first step these will require careful and detailed consideration by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies in order to determine the nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for the State to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute. The State may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I can assure the Deputy that the court will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 77 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of peace and stability in Iraq is a matter which is primarily the responsibility of the Security Council of the United Nations. The council has been actively seized of the matter since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 the Security Council considered a report by the chairman of UNSCOM indicating that there was serious non-compliance by Iraq with the provisions of relevant Security Council resolutions. The issue of the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction &ndash; weapons which that regime has not hesitated to use on innocent civilians &ndash; was not one that could be dismissed. Iraq must comply fully with the terms of the resolutions of the Security Council relating to this issue.</P>
      <P>I have made my position on the question of the US and British military activity against Iraqi air defences clear on a number of occasions. I was deeply disappointed that the use of force was deemed necessary in December. As to whether such activity is properly mandated by the Security Council, the determination of this is a matter in the first instance for the members of the council.</P>
      <P>I remain concerned at the continuation of this military action. I cannot see it having other than negative effects on the grave humanitarian situation facing the Iraqi people. I can only hope that this activity comes to an end as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Security Council began, in January 1999, a major discussion on the options regarding the full implementation of all the relevant Security Council resolutions by Iraq. To assist it in this task, the council decided to establish three separate panels to address issues relating to humanitarian assistance, arms inspections and prisoners of war respectively.</P>
      <P>As regards the plan submitted by France in January, I welcomed the thrust of this plan when it was first tabled. Some at least of the elements in this plan have been reflected in the panels' reports.</P>
      <P>On 25 February the UN Secretary General presented a report to the Security Council on the implementation of the United Nations oil for food programme over the previous 180 day period. It found that while there had been an increase in the amount of oil exported, the revenue received was down due to the fall in oil prices. Consequently, less was available for the humanitarian programme. In addition, partly due to poor Iraqi distribution arrangements and partly to stockpiling by that Government, $275 million worth of medicines and medical supplies were accumulated in warehouses in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early April the three panels referred to above furnished reports to the council. The report on humanitarian issues stated that the <Col N="724" /> gravity of the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people is indisputable and cannot be overstated. To help remedy this situation the panel made a number of recommendations addressed both to the international community and to the Iraqi Government. These included proposals for securing additional funding for the programme such as the lifting of the ceiling of allowable oil exports from Iraq and authorising bilateral production sharing agreements between Iraq and foreign oil companies. These measures could free an extra $300 million every six months for the humanitarian programme.</P>
    <P>The report on disarmament issues reviewed the information on Iraq's programmes of weapons of mass destruction as uncovered by the teams of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and UN Special Commission UNSCOM set up by the council in 1991. It found that, while the situation regarding nuclear weapons and proscribed missiles was satisfactory, there still remained major questions relating to chemical and particularly to biological weapons, where critical gaps made it impossible to provide a complete picture. It concluded that an approach focused on ongoing monitoring and verification including intrusive inspections might offer the opportunity to enlarge the scope of policy options for the council. The key issue was obtaining the acceptance of the Iraqi authorities for such a system.</P>
    <P>The third report addressed the issues of nearly 700 missing prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property. On the first issue, since the beginning of 1999, the Iraqi regime has refused to take part in the meetings of the relevant commission. On the return of Kuwaiti property the report found the level of co-operation by the Government of Iraq inadequate.</P>
    <P>The reports of these three panels were considered by the Security Council in April. I understand that consultations are ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned at the evident humanitarian crisis facing the Iraqi people and will continue to urge that everything possible be done to end it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> President Arafat's visit to Dublin on 3 May was part of an extensive tour of capitals to inform governments of the latest position regarding the planned Palestinian unilateral declaration of statehood, which had been scheduled for 4 May, the deadline set under the Oslo Accords for the end of the transitional period. In his meeting with the Taoiseach, President Arafat said that the declaration made by the European Council in Berlin on 24-25 March had been an extremely important factor in the deliberations of the central council of the PLO which had resulted in a decision to defer the declaration.</P>
    <P>At Berlin the European Council had reaffirmed the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination including the option of a state and had looked forward to early fulfilment of this right &ndash; a right not subject to veto. The European Council, declaring its readiness to consider the recognition of a Palestinian state in due course, had also urged the parties to agree on an extension of the transitional period established by the Oslo Accords and stated that it should be possible to conclude negotiations within a target period of one year. The position of the Union is that the creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing agreements and through negotiations would be the best guarantee of Israel's security and Israel's acceptance as an equal partner in the region.</P>
    <P>President Arafat explained that the central council had postponed, until after the Israeli election on 17 May, the decision to declare Palestinian statehood. The Taoiseach congratulated President Arafat on this decision, which demonstrated a high degree of statesmanship and responsiveness to the wishes of the international community, and noted that it had been endorsed by other Palestinian elements such as Hamas.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is fully reflected in the terms of the Berlin Declaration.</P>
    <P>President Arafat also brought the Taoiseach up to date both on developments relating to certain Israeli practices in the occupied territories. He outlined the continuing restrictions by the Israelis on Palestinian economic activities in the occupied territories particularly those involving trade with the outside world, the steady expansion of illegal settlements in those territories and the introduction of restrictions on Orient House in East Jerusalem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach expressed the hope that the peace process would be revived as quickly as possible after the formation of a new Israeli Government and reiterated that Ireland was fully supportive of the process.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the question of strengthening official Irish-Palestinian relations would be sympathetically considered. In this context, as the Taoiseach has indicated in response to another question in the House earlier today, the Government has decided to establish a representative office in Ramallah. I am actively pur<Col N="726" /> suing all the necessary arrangements to give effect to this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the western Europe and others group of states for the two-year term 2001-2002. The election will take place in the 185-member UN General Assembly in the autumn of 2000, probably in October. The election is being contested by three other candidates, Norway and Turkey, and since 5 March 1999, Italy. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of <Col N="727" /> around 120 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. Since September last, I have personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with representatives of a large number of United Nations member states.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government have also promoted the Irish candidacy in their contacts with other administrations, where this has been appropriate.</P>
    <P>In September, before the campaign entered a more intense phase, we had around thirty commitments. This level of support has been built on and I am determined that by September-October 2000 when the election takes place, we will have the necessary number of votes to secure election. As I have indicated previously, as this is a contested election, I am reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage.</P>
    <P>As regards UN reform, in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Ireland actively supports efforts to modernise and reform the UN system so that it can be more effective in responding to the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium. Our priority is to secure agreement on the measures necessary to revitalise the United Nations and to ensure more vigorous action in fulfilling its mandate under the UN charter of maintaining international peace and security and promoting the economic and social development of all member states. With our EU partners, we have given strong support to measures aimed at securing a better co-ordinated and more streamlined UN, which makes more effective use of personnel and financial resources, and at improving the setting of priorities for action by the UN.</P>
    <P>Ireland takes an active role in ongoing discussions in New York on Security Council reform and, as a member of an informal group of ten small and medium-sized states, has played a significant bridge-building role in the debate. Ireland supports a reform of the composition of the Security Council which would make it more representative of the general membership of the UN. We favour a small increase in permanent members, from its present number of five, selected on the basis of global influence and contribution to the work of the UN as well as considerations of equitable geographical distribution. We also favour a small increase in non-permanent members of around five, with these new seats being allocated to the various regional groups. In addition to the enlargement issue, Ireland favours improved and more transparent working methods of the council involving more frequent consultation between it and the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and other major organs of the UN system. We also see a need for more restrictive use of the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council and we believe <Col N="728" /> that the veto power should not be extended to any new permanent members.</P>
    <P>In the Security Council, Ireland would participate fully in formulating and overseeing implementation of the council's policy decisions on a wide range of issues involving the maintenance of international peace and security. As a small state, our approach would be informed by an historical experience representative of that of many member states and by our consistent commitment to the UN in the fields of disarmament, economic and social development, peacekeeping and human rights.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Security Council would enable Ireland to apply lessons drawn from its own recent national experience and to offer, for use by others, where appropriate, the approach &ndash; reconciliation, mutual respect, partnership &ndash; which has informed the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the reform process under way at the UN is the increasing integration of the hitherto diverse efforts of the organisation. In this way, the Security Council agenda bears ever more directly on the areas of development, including human security and post conflict peace building, human rights and humanitarian endeavour. We would reflect in the council, concerns held among the broad membership and shared by Ireland on the links between human development and security, conflict prevention, etc.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Security Council, Ireland would seek to contribute more effectively to the promotion of reform of the Council itself in keeping with the policy approach I have just outlined.</P>

      <P>Ireland will assume the six month rotating chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe between November 1999 and May 2000. A successful presidency is viewed by the Government as a foreign policy priority.</P>
      <P>The rapid enlargement of the Council of Europe since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe has meant an increasingly substantive role for the organisation in its core functions of strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, in particular, in its new eastern European member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To prepare for the presidency and to deepen Ireland's involvement and contribution to the council, a resident mission has been established in Strasbourg. An effective presidency will require a co-ordinated approach by all the Government Departments and agencies involved by the council. An interdepartmental co-ordinating group has been established under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Elements for the <Col N="729" /> programme for the presidency are being developed.</P>
    <P>The precise issues which will be on the agenda of the council when we assume that chair will be affected by political developments. However, the following issues are likely to be the key tasks facing our chairmanship. It is expected that following a negotiated settlement of the crisis in Kosovo, the Council of Europe will play an important role in post-conflict rehabilitation in Kosovo and the surrounding region. The council, working with the EU and OSCE, can help restore stability to the region. The elements for the council's contribution have been identified. The Kosovo crisis provides a challenge to the functioning of the international system in the post-Cold War era. While the primary responsibility rests with the United Nations, other international bodies, such as the Council of Europe, have important complementary roles to play.</P>
    <P>We support the further enlargement of the council, to strengthen democracy and help ensure stability throughout Europe. We have indicated our intention to work actively as chair to advance the accession of applicant states &ndash; Bosnia, Herzegovina, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Monaco.</P>
    <P>We will maintain the focus on compliance by member states with their Council of Europe obligations and commitments. Enlargement of the council should not mean any dilution in standards. We will pay particular attention to the role of the Committee of Ministers in implementing the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done to define clear objectives for the Council of Europe and to translate these into the council's structures and working methods. This will be a priority for our chairmanship.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe is both an intergovernmental and interparliamentary body. During our chairmanship, we will seek to develop closer relations between the Committee of Ministers and the assembly. The Irish delegation to the assembly has an important role to play in this regard. As part of the programme for our presidency, it is proposed to invite the parliamentary assembly to meet in Ireland in May 2000.</P>
    <P>A detailed programme for our presidency is being developed and will be communicated to the Oireachtas at a later stage.</P>

      <P>On 18 December 1998, it was agreed that tourism would be one of six matters where North-South co-operation would be conducted through existing bodies, as provided for in paragraph 9 (i) of strand two of the Good Friday Agreement. It was <Col N="730" /> further specified that a publicly-owned limited company would be established by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to carry out overseas marketing and promotion activity on their behalf.</P>
      <P>North-South co-operation arrangements are to commence at the time of the devolution of powers to Northern Ireland and of the entry into force of the other institutions provided for in the British-Irish Agreement. It is envisaged therefore that, in line with what was agreed on 18 December, the tourism company's articles of association and memorandum, which would establish its overall strategic objectives, would be agreed at a very early meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
      <P>Therefore, while the necessary preparatory work is being carried forward at official level and indeed is well advanced, it will not be possible to establish the company before the North-South Ministerial Council itself comes into being. This in turn depends on a resolution of the current impasse regarding the creation of the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently received a copy of the briefing paper prepared by World Vision Ireland on children of war. This paper highlights the fact that there are more than 300,000 children actively engaged in conflict around the world. This represents an increase of 50,000 in recent years. War, poverty, displacement and marginalization are the root causes of this horrific phenomenon.</P>
      <P>This issue is of particular concern to me and I strongly support international efforts to stop the use of child soldiers. In particular, we are actively supporting the Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. The special representative, Mr. Olaru Otunnu, acts as an advocate for the adoption of measures to protect children and their mothers in areas of armed conflict, to prevent the recruitment of children as armed combatants, and to promote the demobilisation and reintegration of children who have been engaged in armed conflict with particular reference to their mental and physical health and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has recently joined an informal group known as the friends of the special representative, which includes 11 other EU member states and the EU Commission as well as Canada, Japan, Malaysia, India and Kenya. The aim of the group of friends is to support the work of the special representative and to promote measures for the <Col N="731" /> protection of children in armed conflict. In 1999, we will contribute IR£38,000 to a trust fund set up to support the work of the special representative.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is central to the protection and promotion of children's rights on a global level and has achieved almost universal ratification. During the 55th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which concluded its deliberations in Geneva on 30 April, a special session on children was held to mark the tenth anniversary of the convention, during which national delegations and UN agencies addressed concerns regarding implementation of the convention, particularly marginalisation and exclusion, as well as the question of children in armed conflict. The statistics provided at that session by agencies such as the ILO, WHO and UNICEF reflect a situation which is indeed shameful.</P>
    <P>We will continue to support the work of the working group set up to draft an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on involvement of children in armed conflicts. The working group is seeking to strengthen international standards for protection of children in armed conflicts, in particular by raising the minimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilities.</P>
    <P>Also at this year's commission, a European Union resolution on the rights of the child was adopted by consensus. That resolution was fully supported by the Irish delegation. It condemned the abduction of children in situations of armed conflict; it emphasised the urgent need to raise the current minimum age limit of recruitment and participation of any person in armed conflicts; and it pledged UN member states to address the impact on children of the use of weapons in situations of armed conflict, including small arms and light weapons, and to address the results of the illicit production and traffic of such weapons. Specifically in relation to the situation in northern Uganda which was highlighted in the World Vision Ireland paper, Ireland voted in favour of a resolution at the commission which condemned in the strongest terms all parties involved in the abduction, torture, killing, rape, enslavement and forcible recruitment of children in northern Uganda; demanded the immediate cessation of all abductions and attacks on all civilian populations; and called for the immediate and unconditional release and safe return of all abducted children currently held by the Lords Resistance Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The burden of debt on many developing countries is an urgent challenge to the entire international community. Excessive and unsustainable debt levels have severely hindered the development prospects of many countries and this is a burden which has been disproportionately borne by the poorest. I am deeply concerned about the effects of debt. I intend that Ireland should participate fully in international measures to tackle the debt crisis.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries. Our policy has always been, and will continue to be, to provide development assistance in the form of grants, rather than loans.</P>
      <P>While Ireland is therefore not in a position to take a lead on the issue of debt cancellation, we do strongly welcome those measures &ndash; either cancellation or rescheduling of debt &ndash; which have occurred. We also recognise that these measures have not proved sufficient.</P>
      <P>Our concern about the effects of the debt crisis led the Government in September 1998 to agree to a comprehensive debt relief package committing funds of over £31 million to ease the debt burden on the heavily indebted poor countries. This comprises £9.5 million committed to debt relief in two of the priority countries for Irish aid, Mozambique and Tanzania and £22 million to be given to multilateral debt alleviation, mainly through the joint World Bank and IMF heavily indebted poor country (HIPC) initiative. The Government also adopted a number of principles to guide our future policy on the debt situation of developing countries, intending to make the debt issue central to our future aid strategy.</P>
      <P>Recent months have witnessed a new international resolve on debt, including the Cologne initiative launched by the German Chancellor in January 1999 as well as proposals from the US, Canada, France and the UK in recent weeks. Collectively, these developments mark an important change in terms of international attitudes towards the problem of developing world indebtedness and specifically acknowledge that present debt alleviation measures, including the joint World Bank and IMF heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, must be significantly strengthened.</P>
      <P>The interim and development committees of the World Bank and IMF at their spring meeting in Washington at the end of April agreed on the importance of enabling HIPC relief to be broader, faster and deeper and reiterated the importance of ensuring a clear link between debt relief and the goals of sustainable development and poverty reduction. The annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF next September is likely to consider comprehensive new measures designed to address the debt relief needs of the heavily indebted poor countries in a shorter time frame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> I fully respect the views of Jubilee 2000 on the issue of debt cancellation. However, few governments, from either developed or developing countries, have called for absolute debt cancellation, as opposed to measures to substantially alleviate the debt situation facing many developing countries. In respect of general bilateral and multilateral debt, the position taken to date by developing countries is to generally favour reducing the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries to a sustainable level, which would allow them to foster a process of economic growth and development.</P>
    <P>The principles adopted by the Government in September include a commitment to strongly encourage the international community to take a generous and flexible approach to debt alleviation. Ireland will continue to use every opportunity to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden on developing countries.</P>

The Government has been &ndash; and continues to be &ndash; supportive of their wish to have the threats against them lifted and believes that they should be allowed to return home safely. It is clear that this inhumane practice is a breach both of the law and of basic human rights.</P>
      <P>This issue has been raised through the framework of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference. We are awaiting a response from the British side on the numbers involved. We understand that British estimates over recent years range from 55 to over 100 per annum. The nature of this issue means that it is difficult to arrive at definitive statistics.</P>
      <P>The Government has at all times, in its contacts with all those concerned, including parties with influence on paramilitary organisations, emphasised the need to adhere to the principles of non-violence and democracy as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. Involvement in any form of intimidation or breaches of human rights is simply incompatible with the terms and spirit of the Agreement and the new context created by a sustained peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the resumption of the civil war in Angola and at the appalling consequences of this for the civilian population. Conflict has resumed despite the support which had been given by Ireland and other members of the international community to the implementation of the Lusaka peace process. Under this some concrete progress had been made towards demobilisation, disarmament, demining, local power-sharing and parliamentary democracy. Together with our EU partners at the recent 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, we have voiced our concerns about the increase in human rights abuses and breaches of international humanitarian law in Angola.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council, in its statement of 14 April, reiterated that the primary cause of the current crisis in Angola is the refusal by UNITA to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka protocol. It has called on UNITA to comply with its obligations to demilitarise and to permit the extension of state administration to areas under its control. The council has also expressed its concern at the continued violation of its sanctions against UNITA which has been rearming. It has welcomed the mission to Angola by the chairman of the relevant UN sanctions committee which is to take place this month. He has also been mandated to investigate violations and to examine possible measures to strengthen their implementation. The UN sanctions have been supported by the adoption of an EU common position and council regulations and by corresponding national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Angolan conflict also has disturbing regional implications in view of the ongoing war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo and tensions with Zambia. It is hoped that the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding between Angola and Zambia and recent <Col N="735" /> EU demarches in Luanda and Lusaka will help to ease these tensions. I hope that ongoing efforts to begin a peaceful dialogue in the Democratic Republic of Congo will help to lift some of the obstacles to a peaceful settlement.</P>
    <P>There is no alternative to a political settlement of the Angolan conflict. We will therefore continue to call on both sides to return to negotiation, to desist from remining, to respect human rights and to co-operate fully with humanitarian organisations in the delivery of emergency assistance. We are also providing assistance &ndash; last month a grant for Angola of IR£ 150,000 was made by the Government to the international committee of the Red Cross. We are supporting regional efforts and those of Mr. Issa Diallo, the special representative of the UN Secretary General, to ensure a continued UN presence in Angola and to bring about an early end to the conflict.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>When I launched the new agenda declaration in Dublin on 9 June 1998, I stated that it was my intention to pursue this initiative in the context of the General Assembly of the United Nations and at other fora as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In September the eight foreign ministers of the new agenda group met in New York and launched a draft resolution at the General Assembly with a view to securing the support of the wider international community for the objectives which the new agenda group had set.</P>
      <P>This draft resolution became the centrepiece of the disarmament deliberations in the General Assembly and the new agenda countries worked tirelessly to bring the international community to endorse the new direction which we had advanced and to act on foot of our recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Assembly adopted our draft resolution by 114 votes in favour, with 38 abstentions and 18 negative votes. This was an outstanding result for a resolution which aimed to set aside the impasse in nuclear disarmament and the drift towards acceptance of the indefinite retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapon states. It was in particular significant that the non-nuclear weapon states members of NATO <Col N="736" /> decided not to oppose our resolution, recognising that our approach represented a realistic way forward in nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done, however, to achieve the objectives set out in the new agenda. One area where we are focusing attention is the preparation of the non-proliferation treaty review conference scheduled for next year. This will be a singularly important gathering of the states' parties. All the parties to the treaty, both nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states alike, are committed under Article VI to the elimination of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament. In the framework of these legally binding commitments it is our intention to urge the nuclear weapon states to commit themselves unequivocally to pursue those steps required by them to realise the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>We will return to the United Nations General Assembly later this year with a draft resolution and with a view to securing an even greater number of endorsements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 March last, I outlined to the House the main priorities for Ireland as chair of the 55th session of the Commission on Human Rights. The main objectives were to facilitate a review of mechanisms and procedures of the commission; preparations for the world conference on racism; the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and resources for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Under the first heading, review of the mechanisms of the commission, the chair held lengthy negotiations throughout the six weeks in an effort to reconcile intractable positions on the future of human rights mechanisms. Agreement was reached on a way forward and a working group was established to continue efforts to strengthen the mechanisms of the commission. However, the agreement achieved was fragile and future progress will depend very much on the political will of all participants. Ireland, for its part, will continue to play a constructive role and seek to bring all sides together to enhance the capacity of the commission to adequately address human rights situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations for the world conference on racism were also advanced. A working group was established to prepare for the conference and this met several times in the course of the session and its report was adopted by the commission. Ireland played an active role in the working group. The Council of Europe has been designated the regional preparatory forum for the world con<Col N="737" /> ference and we will be participating actively in these preparations.</P>
    <P>This year is the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the commission marked the occasion with a special session devoted to dialogue on children's rights. The session was chaired by Ambassador Anne Anderson, and representatives from the ILO, WHO and UNICEF also participated. In addition, the commission adopted a resolution on the rights of the child which addressed a broad range of children's rights, from the rights of children with disabilities to children affected by sanctions, children in armed conflict and sexual exploitation of children.</P>
    <P>Efforts were also made to address the issue of resources for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and in this regard the commission adopted by consensus a resolution entitled &ldquo;Strengthening the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Apart from Ireland's role as chair of the commission, the Irish delegation contributed to all aspects of the work of the commission. We again tabled a resolution on religious intolerance which attracted the support of 61 co-sponsors, the highest to date, and was adopted by consensus. We contributed to the leading role taken by the EU on a number of other important issues including a strong chairman's statement on Colombia. The resolution on the death penalty was an EU initiative for the first time this year, and included a number of new elements including protection of minors and extradition. The commission also took a strong position on the situation in Kosovo, condemning the ethnic cleansing of the region. A special two-hour debate was held early in the session followed by weekly updates of the situation there by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In addition, the commission adopted two resolutions which addressed the human rights situation in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The commission adopted 82 resolutions on a wide variety of human rights issues, from country situations to thematic issues. However, any objective assessment would have to acknowledge that it was a particularly difficult session. It was disappointing that the capacity of the commission to address human rights violations was again perceived by a number of observers as being less than adequate. In particular, the efforts of some countries to prevent valid concerns regarding their human rights record being raised was frustrating. In this regard, I see the small but significant steps taken to review the mechanisms of the commission, with a view to enhancing its effectiveness, as the most important result of the work this year. The commission must be able to address serious violations of human rights when they occur, focusing its actions on the core problems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 70 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I remain most concerned at the current situation in Algeria which remains tense. While the scale of the violence and unrest has abated, reports indicate that serious outbreaks of violence have not yet ceased.</P>
      <P>I share the dismay of others at the manner in which the recent presidential election process was conducted. The withdrawal of six of the seven candidates just before the election, because of their concerns about the probity of the electoral process, was a serious setback for the process of democratisation in Algeria.</P>
      <P>Following an approach by Ireland, the Presidency, with the approval of EU partners, issued a statement on 21 April which stated the Union's belief that it is by promoting democracy and the rule of law and by continuing with economic and social reforms that Algeria will be able to emerge from the crisis in which it has been embroiled for a number of years. The Union went on to state that it would attach the greatest importance to initiatives along these lines by the newly elected President Bouteflika. The Union confirmed its readiness to support the reform process in Algeria, particularly by way of Euro-Mediterranean co-operation, and to continue the political dialogue entered into with the Algerian authorities.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the successful recent visit to Algeria by the delegation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs. I noted the extensive series of contacts which they had with Algerian political parties while there and was impressed with the spirit in which the exchanges of views took place. Contacts such as this are a most important means of encouraging the processes of normalisation and democracy in Algeria and I would like to congratulate the members of the committee on their initiative in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> As the members of the House are aware, I visited Algeria in December 1997 to see the situation there at first hand. Since then, I have had further discussions with my Algerian counterpart on several occasions &ndash; at the Euro-Mediterranean foreign ministers conference last June and at the UN General Assembly last September. I am currently planning to attend the OAU summit which will be taking place in Algiers from 12 to 14 July, and I hope to meet my Algerian counterpart on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and our EU partners are supporting efforts aimed at securing an early ceasefire and at restoring peace and stability in Sierra Leone. We are also seeking to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the suffering civilian population. This action is being taken pursuant to the position adopted by the EU at the general affairs council on 25 January, when the council expressed its grave concern at events in Sierra Leone and reiterated support for the democratically elected government. In addition, we voiced our continuing concerns about the <Col N="740" /> deplorable human rights violations perpetrated during the current conflict at the recent 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The decision of the UN Security Council to extend the mandate of the UN observer mission in Sierra Leone, UNOMSIL, until 13 June has been welcomed by the Government as consistent with our wish to see a continued UN presence in that country.</P>
    <P>At present, hopes for a peaceful settlement lie in the joint efforts of Mr. Francis G. Okelo, special representative of the UN Secretary General, and President Eyadema of Togo who is chair of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. They are facilitating talks between the conflicting parties, including through a special preparatory meeting of rebel representatives convened in the Togolese capital, Lomé. Mr. Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, has been allowed to travel to Lomé from Freetown where he had been held on charges arising from a previous rebel coup attempt.</P>
    <P>A ceasefire proposal has been tabled by special representative Okelo. Efforts are being made to overcome the respective reservations of the conflicting parties about this proposal. While the rebel side initially expressed willingness to accept it, Freetown's continued efforts to forcefully retake rebel-held areas and valuable diamond mines have upset rebel negotiators. President Kabbah has also stipulated that the cease-fire proposal be ratified by traditional chiefs, the regional peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, and his cabinet. The Government will continue to support the ongoing work of the UN and ECOWAS facilitators to secure early agreement to a ceasefire. I would hope that the outstanding issues can be resolved in a manner which will lead to an early cessation of hostilities followed by direct negotiation.</P>
    <P>Ireland was represented at the second meeting of the Sierra Leone contact group which took place at the UN in New York on 19 April. This was attended by representatives of 22 countries, the UN, ECOWAS, the European Commission and others. The meeting, in seeking to maintain momentum towards a peaceful settlement, recognised that the Abidjan Accord of 1996 remained a valid framework for a negotiated settlement and that it was time to end the cycle of violence in Sierra Leone through a fuller commitment by the parties to that agreement.</P>
    <P>Along with our EU and UN partners, the Government will continue to support diplomatic efforts aimed at an early peaceful resolution of the conflict in Sierra Leone. We will also continue to provide appropriate humanitarian relief to the vulnerable civilian population and to seek improved humanitarian access. Pressure will be maintained on all parties to fully observe human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>

      <P>The developing European security and defence environment is under constant review and analysis within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Within the EU context, a significant development is that the Amsterdam Treaty came into force on 1 May of this year. Under that treaty, the EU has agreed that the progressive framing of a common defence policy now falls within the remit of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In this connection, the EU has agreed to develop a role in humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacekeeping. These are the Petersberg tasks.</P>
      <P>There has been regular and ongoing discussion within the EU and Western European Union, where Ireland is represented as an observer, of how to ensure that the Amsterdam Treaty's mechanisms in relation to the Petersberg tasks work most effectively. I have underlined to my EU colleagues the importance of making effective use of the treaty's mechanisms on the Petersberg tasks, and am glad that there is a general view among EU partners that the EU's priority should be effective conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
      <P>The Vienna European Council in December last invited the German Presidency to further the debate on how the European Union can best ensure effective responses to the kinds of crises that we have seen in areas such as the Balkans in recent years. The European Council will review matters at its meeting in Cologne in June on the basis of a progress report by the German Presidency, and in light of the agreement by NATO at its summit last month to make available NATO assets to support EU Petersberg tasks. I also believe that the European Union will have to take account of the lessons learnt from the Kosovo situation. The European Union will continue its consideration of these matters after the Cologne Summit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 60 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is supporting international efforts aimed at bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea and a return to the peace negotiations being mediated by the Organisation of African Unity. This futile conflict, the political and economic costs of which neither country can afford, is destabilising them both as well as the region of East Africa. It is also having an unacceptable impact on their civilian populations in human rights, humanitarian and social terms. Together with our EU partners, we have raised these concerns at the recent 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, the OAU, UN, EU and other members of the international community have intensified their efforts to resolve this crisis. While both sides of the conflict have nominally accepted the OAU peace proposals, international pressure is now being brought to bear so that remaining differences of interpretation can be resolved. Such a resolution is urgently required if further military clashes on the tense Ethiopia-Eritrean border are to be prevented.</P>
      <P>The UN Special Envoy for Africa, Mr. Mahomed Sahnoun, has been carrying out a shuttle mission between the capitals of Ethiopia and Eritrea. He has also visited the capital of Burkina Faso whose president, Mr. Blaise Compaore, is currently chair of the OAU. As well as meeting the relevant political leaders, Mr. Sahnoun met in Addis Ababa with the OAU Secretary General, Mr. Salim Salim, and briefed ambassadors of the high level delegation &ndash; Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Zimbabwe which has been mandated by the OAU to facilitate a settlement. In addition, he briefed the Irish and other heads of mission who are following the situation closely and availing of their ongoing bilateral contacts to press for an early peaceful settlement. President Compaore has also made himself available to travel immediately to Addis Ababa and Asmara subject to developments.</P>
      <P>The mission by special representative Sahnoun is part of the ongoing co-operation between the UN and OAU Secretaries General which is intended to support the OAU mediation and secure agreement to the proposed OAU peace framework. The UN Secretary General has initiated contingency planning for a possible peace-keeping mission which would support an OAU-brokered settlement. It is hoped that this renewed co-operation can, with intensified EU and international support, lead to an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a resumption of political dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has previously conveyed its concerns about the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities under OAU mediation directly to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities. We have also strongly supported the recent adoption at Council of the EU Common Position in <Col N="743" /> support of the arms embargo on both countries called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1227. We will continue our efforts, bilaterally and with our EU and UN partners, in support of an early and peaceful settlement of the current conflict and in support of the rights of vulnerable civilians about which recent demarches have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Niger, together with many countries in Africa, is currently faced by a variety of preventable diseases which cause widespread suffering and death. These diseases such as polio, measles and noma are often beyond the capacity of governments to tackle on their own. In the case of Niger, recent political upheaval has further impinged on such capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, there is a need for international organisations such as the World Health Organis<Col N="744" /> ation to become involved in the fight against such diseases. Ireland supports the World Health Organisation through our annual funding of its core programmes. This international aspect is also useful as these diseases are of course manifest across international borders.</P>
    <P>The European Union roundly condemned the recent <i>coup détat </i>which took place in Niger and during which President Bare Mainassara was assassinated on 9 April. In particular, it deplored the suspension of the 1996 constitution and the dissolution of the elected parliament and of the government calling upon the military leadership to set a timetable for an early return to democratic government.</P>
    <P>While there have been some moves to create the conditions necessary for a return to democratic government, efforts are being made by the EU to ensure that this takes place with full accountability and respect for the human rights of all citizens and the rule of law. We are seeking to establish a more detailed calendar of transition, respect for basic human rights, judicial impartiality, press freedom and access, good governance and a credible hand-over of power to the transitional government.</P>
    <P>In view of this major setback to Niger's democratic development, the EU has decided, at the General Affairs Council on 26 April, to open consultations with Niger under Article 366(a) of the Lomé Convention. This mechanism is intended to safeguard democracy in Lomé-assisted countries. This may lead to full or partial suspension of EU development co-operation with Niger unless the necessary urgent reforms are implemented.</P>

      <P>Following discussions between the two governments and consultations with the parties in Northern Ireland, a supplementary international agreement, providing for the establishment of the British-Irish Council, was signed by the Secretary of State and myself in Dublin on 8 March 1999. The legislative framework for the establishment of the council is, therefore, now in place.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Council, along with the North-South Ministerial Council, the all-island implementation bodies, the British-Irish intergovernmental conference and the Northern Ireland Executive will be established at the same time as the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The two Governments believe that once the present difficulties regarding the establishment of the Executive are resolved, all the necessary arrangements for the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement can be rapidly completed, and the first meetings of the British-Irish Council, and the other institutions, can take place immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>The Maryfield offices of the Anglo-Irish Secretariat have been closed, and the secretariat and its staff transferred to new premises in the centre of Belfast. Once the British-Irish Agreement enters into force, the Anglo-Irish Secretariat will be redeployed, probably to the Secretariat of the new British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>I would hope and expect that an international presence in Kosovo would be mandated by the UN Security Council as part of the process towards a political solution to the Kosovo crisis. The outcome of the discussions of G8 foreign ministers in Bonn last Thursday indicates that progress in this direction is now being made. I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If deployment of such a peacekeeping force is authorised by the Security Council, then we will actively consider participation by an Irish contingent, having regard to the terms of the mandate <Col N="746" /> and the level of our other overseas commitments in support of the UN.</P>
    <P>The question of the composition of such a mission or force is of course a matter for the Security Council itself and not Mr Milosevic. The Security Council has already taken decisions relating to the protection of the people of Kosovo, and it has the responsibility to see that its earlier decisions are implemented.</P>

      <P>The continuing human rights violations in Burma and the increasing repression of the democratic opposition there is a matter of great concern to the Government and to our partners in the European Union. The EU Common Position on Burma was therefore renewed for a further six months by the General Affairs Council which met in Luxembourg on 26 April 1999. The Council called once more on that occasion for the Burmese authorities to take early and concrete steps towards democracy, respect for human rights and national reconciliation. The Council furthermore expressed its strong wish to initiate a meaningful political dialogue with Burma at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>As an indication of its intention to increase the political pressure on the Burmese Government, the Council has decided to consider the imposition of further restrictive measures against the regime before the next renewal of the common position in October of this year.

      <P>The Government strongly shares the concerns expressed by Amnesty International and others, <Col N="747" /> in particular for the safety of human rights workers and representatives of the Catholic church in Guatemala.</P>
      <P>On 26 April, the EU ambassadors in Guatemala city met, at their request, with the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Foreign Minister was away from Guatemala city at the time. They expressed the EU's serious concern about threats and intimidation against human rights activists and representatives of the Catholic church, and particularly the lack of progress in the investigation into the murder last year of Bishop Gerardi. The Vice-Minister replied that he appreciated European solidarity and expressed the hope that ongoing investigations would soon lead to positive results.</P>
      <P>The EU demarche attracted widespread publicity in Guatemala. We believe that it sent a clear signal of our determination to remain actively and closely engaged with the human rights situation in the country .</P>
      <P>In line with this commitment, at the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU called upon the Guatemalan authorities to renew their efforts to ensure a full investigation into crimes against human rights and to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>It must, however, be acknowledged that after decades of civil war during which there were massive human rights violations, the Guatemalan government, with the help of the international community, has made some progress since the Peace Agreement was signed on 29 December 1996. At the Geneva human rights session the EU recognised and welcomed this progress.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the terrible civil war, the recent final report of the Commission for Historical Clarification in Guatemala, the Truth Commission, has made a vital contribution to the very difficult and painful work of national reconciliation. Like Amnesty International, the European Union believes that the implementation of the Truth Commission's recommendations is essential if human rights are to prevail and individual safety to be guaranteed in the future. At the United Nations, and in Guatemala city itself, the EU has been urging the Guatemalan Government to take all necessary steps to fulfil these recommendations to the fullest possible extent.</P>
      <P>While media attention sometimes tends to focus mainly on the dangers to the lives and safety of human rights workers in Guatemala, there is also widespread crime and insecurity which affects the country generally. This too is a legacy of the turbulence and dislocation of the civil war decades. The new police force is still too small and inexperienced to cope, and the judicial system is too weak. The system requires fundamental reform. Judges need training. A culture of judicial impartiality has to be cultivated. The EU is helping with this work of fundamental importance to human rights and personal security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> The Government will continue to work for the full implementation of the Guatemalan peace agreement.</P>

      <P>Following the decision of the Luxembourg European Council to launch the accession process, negotiations began with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Cyprus , the so called &lsquo;ins' or &lsquo;5+1' countries on 31 March 1998. Concurrent with this process the preparation of negotiations with the five other candidate countries, Slovakia, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia and Bulgaria known as the &lsquo;pre-ins' began through intensive screening of their national legislation by the European Commission. This phase of the screening process was completed in early 1999 and bilateral screening with each of the pre-ins began on 1 March.</P>
      <P>In September 1998 Malta formally requested that its application for EU membership be reactivated. The Commission produced a report in February updating its opinion of June 1993 on Malta's application for EU membership. On the basis of this report the March General Affairs Council decided that screening with Malta should start as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with the in's during the Austrian Presidency covered seven chapters of the Union <i>acquis. </i>The German Presidency has opened a further eight chapters for negotiation and is also carrying forward the work on the chapters still open from the Austrian Presidency. Negotiations at deputy level took place on 19 April with another negotiating meeting at deputy level scheduled for 19 May. Negotiations at foreign minister level will take place on 22 June. The Finnish Presidency will open eight more chapters for negotiation and the Portuguese Presidency will open negotiations on the remaining seven chapters of the <i>acquis. </i>It is therefore expected that by the end of June 2000 negotiations will have formally commenced on all chapters of the <i>acquis.</i>The European Commission will prepare a second set of regular reports on the progress on each of the applicant countries in the accession process. These reports will be considered by the Helsinki European Council. In the light of these reports the Council may decide to include some of the countries currently in the pre-ins group into the formal negotiating process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the enlargement of the Union to include the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. While we do not underestimate the difficulties involved &ndash; either in terms of the necessary preparations on the part of the Union or by the applicants &ndash; we are convinced <Col N="749" /> that enlargement is a historic opportunity for peace and stability in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, along with most of its donor partners, is committed to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance &ndash; ODA &ndash; and to reaching an interim target in the lifetime of this Government of 0.45 per cent of GNP. Very significant progress has been made towards these targets in recent years.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the latest figures available, official development assistance for 1999 will reach £171 million, the highest amount in the 25 years of the existence of an Irish aid programme. This amount will amount to 0.33 per cent of GNP, up from 0.31 per cent in 1998.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that ODA will reach at least £186 million in the year 2000 and at least £213 million in 2001. The figure for 1998 was £144 million.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that these figures are different from those quoted in answer to a question in March. They have been revised on the basis of new information supplied by the EU Commission on the portion of the Irish contribution to the EU budget which is used for aid purposes.</P>
      <P>Only seven years ago in 1992, ODA was a mere £40 million. There has, therefore, been over a four-fold increase in ODA in that seven year period and there will be in excess of a five-fold increase by 2001. No other donor country can claim such a rate of expansion in the period. Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the increase from 1992 to 2001 will be from 0.16 per cent to 0.36 per cent at least.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the main factor in the increase in ODA this year and in the next two years is the Government's agreement to planned increases in Vote 39 in the period 1999 to 2001. This commitment is without precedent in our programme. It provides the single biggest set of increases in the history of Irish aid and it allows for the first time for multi-annual budgeting for long-term, sustainable development programmes in our priority countries, which are among the poorest in the world. This applies also to what we provide to deal with man-made and natural emergencies, for our voluntary contributions to UN and other multilateral aid agencies, for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, and for our assistance through NGOs. Importantly too, these increases are in addition to the package announced some months ago for debt relief.</P>
      <P>What has been agreed is that the aid allocation administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs will amount to at least £400 million in the period 1999 to 2001. Specifically, the aid subheads of Vote 39, the Vote for International Co-operation (Subheads C to G inclusive), will amount to not less than £106.374 million in 1999, £136.400 million in 2000 and £159.200 in 2001. These are guaranteed minimum figures which do not preclude the allocation of even larger amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> This agreement underpins the growth of the aid programme and marks further increments towards the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP and the ultimate goal set by the UN of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>Since my reply to Deputy McManus on 30 March on Question No. 47, the Government has again been in contact with the United Nations on the important question of missing persons in Cyprus. We have reiterated that we stand ready to provide any assistance which the UN considers could be helpful in this regard.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my earlier replies, the question of missing persons is one of the important and sensitive issues which will have to be addressed in the context of the search for an overall political solution to the Cyprus question. In July 1981, a committee on missing persons was established, comprising a representative of each of the two communities on the island and a representative appointed by the UN Secretary General. However, progress proved difficult to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1996, on the occasion of the retirement of his representative on the committee, the Secretary General wrote to the leaders of the two communities requesting a reaffirmation of their commitment to making progress on the issue, before the appointment of a new representative. <Col N="752" /> He set out a number of proposals to which he sought their agreement, concerning the definition of categories of cases, the sequence in which investigations would be carried out and the question of cases without known witnesses. Although both sides informed the Secretary General that they agreed with his proposals, the tasks involved remain to be fully implemented by them. However, in June 1998 the Secretary General appointed Mr. Jean Pierre Ritter as his new representative on the committee of missing persons. The first meeting of the newly reconstituted committee was held on 28 January 1999.</P>
    <P>A related but separate development took place in July 1997, when the leaders of the two communities reached bilateral agreement regarding the exchange of information on the location of the graves of missing persons and the return of their remains. Information with regard to a number of missing persons is understood to have been subsequently exchanged by both sides. Regrettably, issues concerning the victims of the <i>coup d'état</i> against President Makarios in 1974 remain unresolved and continue to impede progress.</P>
    <P>I continue to be concerned at the failure to move forward on this important matter. However, in our recent contacts with the UN we have been assured that the issue of missing persons is among the matters being discussed in the confidential contacts, which are currently taking place between the leaders of the two communities and the Secretary General's deputy special representative Dame Anne Hercus, in the search for an overall political solution to the Cyprus question. The Government will continue to follow the issue closely and to provide every assistance to the UN in its efforts to help both communities to achieve progress in the matter.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply on this matter to Deputy O'Sullivan on 30 March, the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan was discussed at the EU General Affairs Council on 22 February, which I attended. Following our discussion, a declaration was issued in the name of the Union which took note of the assurance of the Turkish Government that Mr. Ocalan would receive a fair trial. We emphasised, however, that we expected this to mean fair and correct treatment and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court, with access to legal counsel of his choice and with international observers admitted to the trial. We also reiterated our strong oppo<Col N="753" /> sition to the death penalty. I communicated these views directly to the then speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly during his visit to Dublin in early March and he responded to my concerns positively.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ocalan has appointed a team of lawyers who have been meeting him at the island prison of Imrali on a regular basis. A preliminary hearing of the Ocalan case was held in the Ankara State Security Court on 30 April. The formal trial is scheduled to commence on 31 May on Imrali. Recently, Mr. Ocalan's lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case citing allegations of harassment by the authorities including an assault last week following the preliminary hearing in Ankara. They have also complained that they have been denied private access to him during their visits. The Government is concerned at these allegations and we will avail of an appropriate opportunity to raise these concerns with the Turkish authorities.</P>
      <P>On 3 March the Turkish authorities granted unrestricted access to Mr. Ocalan in Imrali prison to representatives of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. In their report, they described the material conditions of his detention as of a high standard but they recommended that he be provided with a radio, newspapers and books. With regard to his outdoor exercise facility, they recommended that he be permitted from time to time access to a larger area. They also expressed some unease about his psychological health due to his solitary detention in a remote location under a high security regime. However, the delegation declared itself satisfied that Mr. Ocalan was not at risk of physical ill treatment and from interviews with him and the three doctors attending him was satisfied that his physical health was good.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of international observers attending Mr. Ocalan's trial, the Turkish authorities have pointed out that while there is no provision in Turkish law for the presence of official observers at a trial, they are in general open to the public, including foreign nationals. This was confirmed at the preliminary hearing of the case at the Ankara State Security Court on 30 April. While the court emphasised that official observers and representatives would not be permitted to attend the trial, they stressed that foreign nationals are welcome to attend in an individual capacity subject to availability of seats in the courtroom. Two members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe attended the Ankara hearing and the assembly hopes to have members present at the substantive trial. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will be following the trial of Mr. Ocalan closely.</P>

      <P>There is no universally enforceable oil embargo against the FRY which has been adopted by the United Nations Security Council. A ban on the export to the FRY of petroleum and petroleum products from member states has been introduced by the European Union, and this ban is being supported by a number of other countries, including EU associates. Other countries have also introduced similar measures.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the implementation of the EU ban is a matter for national authorities and we are taking the necessary measures to ensure this in the case of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware there is no oil embargo by NATO as such against the FRY, nor has NATO been mandated by the international community to enforce such measures.</P>
      <P>I understand that NATO is currently considering how to prevent oil reaching the military and other security forces of the FRY.</P>

      <P>The material to which the Deputy refers in this question was supplied, by way of information concerning Ireland's candidacy for election to non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for the two year term 2001-2. As such, the material in question concentrates on Ireland's role and record at the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's candidacy for election to non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council flows from this country's long-standing and active commitment to the work of the United Nations in all its aspects. These include peacekeeping, where Ireland currently ranks sixth among states which contribute personnel to UN peacekeeping operations; disarmament, where Ireland is maintaining its tradition of important international initiatives; development, where, in contrast to a disturbing international trend, Ireland's development co-operation programmes continue to expand steadily; and human rights for all, in which connection Ireland has just chaired the 54th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland's candidacy also appeals to the principle that small and medium sized, as well as large states should have an opportunity to serve on the Security Council at reasonable intervals. By 2001, it will be two decades since Ireland last served on the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's concern about the protection of human rights and basic freedoms in Turkey, including the Kurdish population of south east Turkey, is well known. This has been conveyed in our bilateral contacts to the Turkish authorities on numerous occasions. On 4 March I availed of the visit to Dublin by the Turkish parliamentary delegation led by the then speaker Cetin to stress the Irish Government's concerns in this regard and the importance of priority attention being given to these issues by the incoming administration.</P>
      <P>As regards political developments in Turkey, nationwide elections to the Turkish Grand National Assembly were held on 18 April 1999 and the new session of the assembly opened on 2 May. Five political parties secured representation in the 550 seat assembly. The Democratic Left Party of acting Prime Minister Ecevit secured 136 seats, the Nationalist Action Party which was not represented in the outgoing parliament won 129 seats, the Islamist Virtue Party won 111 seats, the Motherland Party of former Prime Minister Yilmaz secured 86 seats and the True Path Party of former Prime Minister Ciller won 85 seats. Three independents also secured election.</P>
      <P>At the opening session of the assembly a controversy arose over the decision of a Virtue Party representative, Ms Kavakci, to wear an Islamic style headscarf in the assembly. In a subsequent development the deputy chairman of the Virtue Party resigned following internal party disagreements on the issue. Under the Turkish Constitution the secular nature of the Turkish state is paramount. The wearing of headscarves is seen by secular Turks as a symbol of religious fundamentalism and secularist politicians believe that wearing headscarves in the assembly violates the spirit of the constitution.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the state security court prosecutor opened proceedings for the dissolution of the Virtue Party by the constitutional court. It is understood that in his indictment the prosecutor invoked articles of the Turkish Constitution which stipulate that programmes and activities of political parties must not violate the democratic and secular character of the country.</P>
      <P>On 3 May, President Demirel asked acting Prime Minister Ecevit to form a new government. Prime Minister-designate Ecevit is in ongoing contact with the other parties in this regard. We hope that the programme of the incoming government will attach priority to the improvement of human rights in Turkey including in relation to the Turkish people of Kurdish origin. The strengthening of Turkey's links with the Union depends on Turkey's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and respect for and protection of minorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a similar question on 15 December last, I stated that I had read with interest the policy document, prepared by Deputy Hogan's party, which proposed the establishment in Dublin of a foundation for transatlantic co-operation.</P>
      <P>As I said on that occasion, any serious proposals designed to strengthen the crucially important relationships between Europe and North America are worthy of close consideration. One of my priorities as Minister for Foreign Affairs is to ensure that co-operation between Europe and the USA, and Europe and Canada, is reinforced and further developed. To that end, and in close consultation with our EU partners, we will continue to be engaged in the ongoing transatlantic dialogue in an active and constructive manner.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out that there already exists a number of frameworks within which EU-North American relations are conducted, for example, the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, and its associated joint action plan, which aims to accelerate economic growth through the reduction of technical barriers to trade, services and investment between the EU and USA. We have the Joint EU-Canada Declaration and Action Plan, which covers, among other issues, economic and trade relations. Discussions are continuing between the EU and Canada on the development of an EU-Canada Trade Initiative &ndash; ECTI. Regular summit meetings between the EU and Canada, and the EU and USA, are a distinctive feature of the strong relationships involved. The next summit meetings with Canada and the USA are due to take place in Bonn next month. It is important to emphasise that the existing frameworks are relatively new and are still being developed and consolidated. My opinion, which is shared by my EU colleagues, is that they should be given time to work. The recent experience of trade frictions between the EU and North America has highlighted the importance of developing and strengthening these mechanisms. I may say that the policy document provides a useful summary guide to these framework arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It remains my opinion that if the document helps to stimulate a greater public awareness of the importance of the transatlantic relationship, it will have made a worthwhile contribution to the discussion of this question. While I share the general aim inspiring the proposal, it is essential that any new institution, such as the proposed foundation, should not duplicate the existing frameworks which already provide valuable channels for further developing the transatlantic dialogue. Ireland continues to be closely involved in promoting that dialogue through the EU agencies <Col N="758" /> responsible for its conduct. In my reply of 15 December, I noted that the proposal also contained significant financial implications which would have to be assessed with particular care. My view has not changed since then. One would need to be fully satisfied with regard to both of these factors if the proposed project were to be effectively advanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the brutal murder of Rosemary Nelson the Government has made clear to the British Government that the investigation into her death must be &ndash; and be seen to be &ndash;  thorough, transparent and independent.</P>
      <P>The Government is acutely aware of the concerns which have been expressed in the nationalist community and on the part of human rights organisations, both here and internationally, about the role of the RUC in the investigation into the murder of Rosemary Nelson, notwithstanding a number of changes announced by the chief constable, Ronnie Flanigan. Despite the appointment of the deputy chief constable of Norfolk, Mr. Colin Port, to direct the investigation, it has yet to secure the widespread confidence essential to ensure that all potential witnesses or those with relevant information can feel free to come forward. The Government maintains continuous contact with human rights organisations and others about the case and the conduct of the investigation, and the Department of Foreign Affairs is engaged in ongoing discussions with the British side within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference with a view to resolving these concerns.</P>
      <P>The murder of Pat Finucane in 1989 is also a cause of the deepest concern to the Government. On 12 February 1999, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, met with the widow of Pat Finucane. At this meeting, she received a copy of a new report by British Irish Rights Watch into allegations of collusion and a copy of the report was presented the same day to the British Government.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the report has been prepared in the Department of Foreign Affairs and is also currently the subject of discussions with the British side. I am keenly aware of media reports about the Government's position regarding a public inquiry, including the publication last week in <i>The Irish Times</i> of leaked Government documents. However, as the Government's discussions with the British authorities are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this time.</P>

      <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 10 who is on invalidity pension and on a community employment scheme can only claim for himself and not his children on the community employment scheme when a lone parent can claim for her children on both payments. </Quest>

      <P>Invalidity pension is a social insurance payment paid to persons who are deemed to be permanently incapable of work by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. As a general rule, a person in receipt of an invalidity pension is therefore not eligible to participate in a community employment project. However, exceptions are made for courses enabling persons to retrain for different types of work they might be able to undertake and for work of a rehabilitative nature.</P>
      <P>A person on invalidity pension receives a personal weekly rate of £72.20. The qualified adult allowance is an additional £46.50 and the child dependant allowance is £15.20 for each child. A person on invalidity pension who is participating on a community employment project would receive in addition a weekly payment of £89.75. Thus an invalid pensioner who is on community employment and single receives a total weekly amount of £161.95. An invalid pensioner on community employment with a qualified adult and one dependent child receives a total weekly amount of £223.65.</P>
      <P>A person in receipt of one-parent family payment receives a personal weekly rate of £70.50 and a child dependant allowance of £15.20 for each child. If the lone parent participates on a community employment project there is an additional payment of £89.75 personal rate and £13.20 child dependant allowance for each child. A lone parent who has one dependent child and is on community employment receives a total weekly amount of £188.65. Unlike invalidity pension, the one-parent family payment is means-tested. Once weekly earnings exceed £115.38 there is a tapered withdrawal of the one-parent family payment. This would apply, for example, in the case of a lone parent on the community employment programme who has two dependent children.</P>
      <P>The additional child dependant allowance paid to a lone parent on community employment is intended as a support for child care. It is recognised that lone parents have particular difficulty in accessing employment and training programmes because of child care needs.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of an application for a further £200,000 in support from my Department for the organisation in question but I should also point out that if such an application was made the Department would not be in a position to consider it. There are a large number of ongoing projects under a range of EU initiatives managed by the Department whose implementation depends on the promoters' ability to provide matching funding from other sources. Both the ESF and European Regional Development Fund approvals in this case, as is normal for other such projects under EU initiatives, were made expressly on the basis of the promoter securing a minimum of 25 per cent in matching funds from non-EU sources.</P>

      <P>The job initiative is a work reintegration programme targeted at the very long-term unemployed, persons on the live register for five years or more and aged 35 or over. Job initiative participants have access to three years temporary employment. Budget 1999 added an additional 875 places to job initiative provision, bringing the total number of places available under job initiative to 2,875.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first 1,000 job initiative participants are in the third and final year of their programme. An independent review of the pilot programme is being commissioned and any policy decisions regarding the future of the programme will be <Col N="761" /> deferred until this report is to hand, which should be by June 1999.  On the question of a further extension for the current participants, I have to stress that the fundamental objective of the programme is to facilitate their reintegration into the open labour market. As a general principle it would also not be fair to other very long-term unemployed persons who might avail of this programme. On the positive side, I understand that a number of participants have already left the programme prior to completing three years in order to take up jobs. This is an encouraging sign of the programme's efficacy and of the motivation of participants.</P>
    <P>On the basis of experience gained a significant number of participants should be able to get jobs in the open labour market on completion of the programme and FÁS will provide progression advice and support to all participants in the lead up to completion. The managing agents for the job initiative have particular obligations in this regard also. I accept, however, that there may be some participants who face particular problems in taking this final step and can assure the Deputy that we will seek to deal with such cases in a sympathetic way.</P>

Where disputes arise in relation to the agreement of a closure package, the normal industrial relations mechanisms provided by the statutory agencies, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to the parties to the dispute.</P>
      <P>This country has a well developed voluntary industrial relations system. The system leaves it to the parties involved in any dispute to attempt to reach a resolution themselves. The labour relations agencies are available to assist in the resolution of a dispute, at the request of the parties. I would encourage the parties to any dispute to avail of such services where appropriate.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for provision and operation of post leaving certificate courses rests with the Department of Education and Science. My Department, along with its appropriate agencies, together with the Department of Education and Science participates in the expert group on future skills needs. The remit of this group is to examine emerging <Col N="763" /> skills needs within the economy, including the teleservices sector.</P>
      <P>Relevant agencies of my Department are also involved in the national skills awareness campaign which is being run under the auspices of the expert group on future skills needs. The primary objective of the campaign is to encourage second level students to consider a career in the expanding technology sector, which is of considerable importance to the Irish economy. As part of the awareness campaign, a range of measures have been undertaken to promote awareness of the opportunities available in the teleservices sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to this work, a teleservices forum, which comprises representatives of companies from within the industry, is actively engaged in promoting teleservices as a career.</P>

      <P>The 2 per cent levy currently applied to most insurance policies is in fact an exchequer levy and, therefore, a matter for our colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The insurance compensation fund levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as, at that stage, it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc. The levy, originally introduced in 1984 following the collapse of PMPA, was paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2 per cent of gross premium income until 31 December 1991, reducing to 1 per cent between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1992. As regards the sale of the PMPA, while the ongoing business and the name of PMPA were indeed sold in 1989, the administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 108, 109, 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Fisheries Act, 1935, the ESB is the statutory owner of the Shannon fisheries, and there are no plans at present to alter the existing statutory arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board is currently responsible for development work on the Shannon under lease from the ESB and Central Fisheries Board. The board allocated just over £800,000 of its 1998 budget of £1.2 million to fisheries service in the Shannon system above Limerick and excluding Lough Sheelin and the Brosna. The board has 47 permanent field staff deployed in the Shannon region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The ESB recently completed a four year survey and analysis of trout stocks in the lower Shannon system and consultations are in progress with the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the midwest regional authority on a follow-up fisheries improvement programme, in light of the findings of the survey. Key elements of the envisaged fisheries improvement programme would include habitat conservation and enhancement as well as improving water quality generally in the system in order to underpin future restocking strategies. During the period in question, 1991-98, the ESB did not restock the Shannon with trout. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board continued its trout restocking programme in those Shannon tributaries and lakes under its management as follows:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity to hear their views when I met recently with Irish NGOs to discuss Ireland's humanitarian assistance to Kosovo. In addition, this group recently had a meeting with officials from Irish Aid. Effective co-ordination is one of the keys to the timely and successful deliv<Col N="767" /> ery of emergency aid. Failures of co-ordination in previous crises led to duplication of aid in some places and gaps in others.</P>
    <P>Ireland strongly supports the role of the United Nations in the co-ordination of humanitarian assistance of the international community. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees &ndash; UNHCR &ndash; has been nominated the lead agency co-ordinating the humanitarian response to the Kosovo crisis. When considering the disbursal of humanitarian assistance the Government takes into account the ability of agencies to work collaboratively with UN, other NGOs and host government officials.</P>
    <P>While the Government strongly supports the need to ensure effective and efficient co-ordination of humanitarian assistance, it is up to the non-governmental organisations to decide whether they wish to work together under an umbrella group to raise funds.</P>

      <P>Ireland has not been asked to send troops to any new locations abroad to serve with peacekeeping missions. No new peacekeeping missions have been established recently by organisations of which Ireland is a member. The most recent UN operation &ndash; in Sierra Leone &ndash; was established in July 1998. Ireland was invited to consider participation in this mission but decided not to take part due to Defence Forces staff constraints and the poor security situation in Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>There are a number of conflict situations worldwide, including, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Angola, East Timor, as well as Kosovo, which may, if resolved, see the establishment of UN or other peacekeeping or observer missions. It is possible that Ireland may receive a request to participate in one or more such missions from those organisations &ndash; the UN and the OSCE &ndash; of which we are members. Any request for participation by Irish troops would be given careful consideration and assessed on the basis of the security situation, the mandate of the mission, and other factors such as equipment and skills necessary for the mission.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing 850 troops to UN peacekeeping under the UN standby arrangements system. While the bulk of the troops committed under this arrangement are already deployed in the field, primarily with UNIFIL in Lebanon, the UN may request troops from the remainder of the allocation where a suitable opportunity is identified. This has not occurred to date. There is no obligation to provide troops in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is deeply concerned about the burden of foreign debt on many developing countries. The need to service such debt has diverted scarce resources away from areas of pressing need such as health and education in the countries which can least afford to make such sacrifices. This issue demands a coherent and far-reaching international response. I intend that Ireland should play the fullest possible part in this response.</P>
      <P>Our concern about the effects of the debt crisis led the Government in September of last year to agree to a comprehensive debt relief package committing funds of over £31 million to ease the debt burden on the heavily indebted poor countries. This comprises £9.5 million committed to debt relief in two of the priority countries for Irish aid, Mozambique and Tanzania, and £22 million to be given to multilateral debt alleviation, mainly through the joint World Bank-IMF heavily indebted poor country &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative. The Government also adopted a number of principles to guide our future policy on the debt situation of developing countries, intended to make the debt issue central to our future aid strategy.</P>
      <P>There has been a series of new initiatives on the issue of developing country debt in recent months, mainly from the G7 countries. This includes the Cologne initiative launched by the German Chancellor last January as well as proposals from the US, Canada, France and the UK. Collectively, these developments mark an important change in terms of international attitudes towards the problem of developing world indebtedness and specifically acknowledge that present debt alleviation measures, including the joint World Bank-IMF heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative, must be significantly strengthened.</P>
      <P>The interim and development committees of the World Bank and IMF at their spring meeting in Washington at the end of April agreed on the importance of enabling HIPC relief to be broader, faster and deeper and reiterated the importance of ensuring a clear link between debt relief and the goals of sustainable development and poverty reduction. The annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF next September is likely to consider comprehensive new measures designed to address the debt relief needs of the heavily indebted poor countries in a shorter timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles adopted by the Government last September include a commitment to strongly encourage the international community to take a generous and flexible approach to debt alleviation.

      <P>The foreign debt of developing countries has become a major issue for the international community, including Ireland. There can be no doubt that excessive foreign debt has become a severe hindrance to the development of such countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries. Our policy has always been, and will continue to be, to provide development assistance in the form of grants, rather than loans. While Ireland is, therefore, not in a position to lead by example on the issue of debt cancellation, we strongly welcome those measures &ndash; either cancellation or rescheduling of debt &ndash; which have occurred. We also recognise that these measures have not proved sufficient.</P>
      <P>Our concern about the effects of the debt crisis led the Government in September of last year to agree to a comprehensive debt relief package committing funds of over £31 million to ease the debt burden on the heavily indebted poor countries. This comprises £9.5 million committed to debt relief in two of the priority countries for Irish aid, Mozambique and Tanzania, and £22 million to be given to multilateral debt alleviation, mainly through the joint World Bank-IMF heavily indebted poor country &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative. The Government also adopted a number of principles to guide our future policy on the debt situation of developing countries, intended to make the debt issue central to our future aid strategy.</P>
      <P>While debt cancellation is extremely welcome where it proves possible, what is more generally needed are measures to substantially alleviate the debt situation facing many developing countries, by reducing debt to a sustainable level, which would allow them to foster a process of economic growth and development.</P>
      <P>This is an issue on which a large measure of consensus has emerged in recent months. Several of the major creditor nations have launched new initiatives on debt relief, including the Cologne initiative launched by the German Chancellor last January as well as recent proposals from the US, Canada, France and the UK. Collectively, these developments mark an important change in terms of international attitudes towards the problem of developing world indebtedness and represent a recognition that present debt alleviation measures, including the joint World Bank-IMF heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative, must be significantly strengthened.</P>

The European Communities (Voice Telephony and Universal Service) Regulations, 1999 (S.I.

The regulations also provide that licensed telecommunications operators must ensure that their subscribers have the right to have an entry free of charge in such directories. I understand that the director is making arrangements for the implementation of the relevant provisions of the regulations. These provisions do not apply to classified directories such as the Golden Pages or other commercial directories.</P>

At an inspection of the sheep on 6 April 1999 a total of 1,085 sheep were presented and accepted. However, at a compliance inspection on 14 April 1999 only 782 ewes were found. The person named failed to give a satisfactory explanation to the Department's inspecting officer why the remainder of the sheep were not presented. Therefore, he was deemed to have made a false declaration and he was notified in writing on 6 May 1999 that the penalty was that he was debarred from the scheme for 1999 and 2000. The person named can have his case reviewed by submitting a written appeal to the inspector in charge, Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme in October 1998 in respect of 38 cows. He held a suckler cow quota of 50 premium rights but sold them in 1998.

      <P>The requirement for retention periods during which animals applied on under the various EU headage and premium schemes must be held and maintained by the applicant is an integral part of each scheme and is set out in EU regulations. In the case of cattle headage/beef cow and suckler cow premium schemes the regulations allow for animals applied on to be replaced by other eligible animals during the retention period. Retention periods serve to ensure that beneficiaries under the schemes are genuine farmers who normally maintain livestock on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Different retention periods apply under the different schemes ranging from two months in the case of cattle headage, sheep headage and special beef premium to six months in the case of suckler cow premium. The longer retention period for the suckler cow premium reflects the fact that these animals are in fact the main breeding stock and are not normally disposed of except in the case of normal stock replacement. The shorter retention period for special beef premium reflects the fact that these animals form part of a producers trading stock.</P>
    <P>The retention period for the suckler cow premium scheme is set out in a Council regulation and any variation of the period would therefore require the agreement of the Council of Ministers. Any such change would have to be proposed by the EU Commission.</P>

My Department informed the applicant and he was requested to supply maps showing the full extent of his land. These maps were recently received and showed that all of his land had already been included; EU regulations preclude the making of any area-aid linked payments where the area claimed is in excess of 20 per cent greater than that established As a result there is a 100 per cent penalty applied to the application <Col N="776" /> and no area-aid linked payments can issue to the person concerned for 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>It is my policy is to facilitate the export of animals from this country whilst ensuring that the EU regulatory requirements are properly and fairly implemented. Given the importance of the live export trade to Ireland's agricultural economy, it is essential that we ensure that animals being exported from Ireland undergo to the necessary checks prior to their departure and are transported in a manner which takes proper account of welfare and other considerations. The record clearly shows that nothing in this approach is inconsistent with developing our live export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a major resurgence in live exports from Ireland in 1998, with up to 180,000 cattle exported in that year. There has been a further dramatic surge in live exports this year, with total <Col N="777" /> exports to end April of 115,000 head compared with 41,000 in the same period last year. On the basis of these figures, I cannot accept that operators are experiencing undue difficulty in exporting cattle from Ireland.</P>

My Department informed the applicant and he was requested to supply maps showing the full extent of his land.

EU regulations preclude the making of any area aid linked payments where the area claimed is in excess of 20 per cent greater than that established.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148, 149, 150 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Varroasis, a serious disease of honey bees, caused by the parasitic mite varroa jacobsoni was discovered for the first time in Ireland in June 1998. The mite affects only the honey bee. The quality of honey produced by infected bees is not affected. First indications were that this was an isolated outbreak and consequently a policy of destruction of bee colonies in the area was adopted together with a declaration of the area involved i.e. County Sligo and part of County Mayo as an infected area. Movement of bees into or out of the area was prohibited. The infected area was later extended to include part of County Leitrim. I decided that beekeepers would be com<Col N="779" /> pensated in respect of colonies destroyed at a rate of £80 per colony. A total of 301 colonies were destroyed involving 58 beekeepers.</P>
    <P>An intensive survey was undertaken to determine the extent of the outbreak. This survey revealed that the initial discovery was not an isolated outbreak but part of a more established population of varroa mites in the area. In the light of this information the infected area was extended in April 1999 to include all of counties Mayo and Sligo and that part of Leitrim north of Lough Allen and the policy of eradication was discontinued. The movement of bees out of the infected area continues to be prohibited but beekeepers within the area can now restock with bees from outside of it.</P>
    <P>For the future it will be a matter for Irish beekeepers by continuous monitoring and control to avoid the worst effects of this pest. While there are no funds at my disposal out of which compensation can be paid to beekeepers whose apiaries are affected with varroa, an EU supported fund for the production and marketing of honey will be used to assist the Federation of Irish Beekeepers' Associations to provide an education programme for beekeepers on the recognition and control of the disease. The fund will also be used to carry out further surveys to monitor the presence of the disease in the infected area and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the number of beekeepers compensated each month was as follows: September, 25, October, nine and November, three. In 1999 17 beekeepers were paid compensation in April. Compensation payments in respect of the remaining four beekeepers are being processed.</P>

      <P>The application under the 1998 cattle headage scheme of the person named was received in the local office of the Department on 29 October 1998. The closing date for receipt of applications was 29 May 1998, extended to 5 June 1998, with a late application period up to and including 30 June 1998. Under clause 18 of the terms and conditions of the 1998 cattle headage scheme, no headage grants are payable in respect of applications received after these dates.</P>
      <P>The person named has a suckler cow quota of 32. No application was received under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme from the person named but as an exceptional measure I am arranging for an application under the October 1998 suckler cow scheme to be completed by him, on the basis that there may have been some confusion between submission of the 1998 cattle headage application received on 29 October 1998 and the October 1998 suckler cow scheme.</P>

      <Col N="780" /> The person named was paid £496.00 on 3 July 1998, £245.04 on 22 October 1998 and £307.21 on 26 February 1999 under the 1998 ewe premium scheme. He was paid £446.20 on 1 October 1998 and £57.23 on 26 November 1998 under the 1998 sheep headage scheme. He was paid £184.00 on 17 December 1998 and £92.00 on 29 March 1999 under the 1998 winter fodder scheme.</P>
    <P>The 1998 area aid application of the person named was submitted three days late, on 20 May 1998, so the 1998 ewe premium and sheep headage grants were subject to a late application penalty of 3 per cent, in accordance with clause 9.1 of the terms and conditions of the 1998 area aid scheme.</P>

      <P>All herds in which a BSE positive animal is diagnosed are slaughtered at a designated slaughter plant and subsequently destroyed by rendering and incineration. In addition, the progeny and the birth cohort animals, defined as those animals on the farm which were exposed to the same risk as the BSE case during the first six months of life, are also traced and destroyed in the same manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The herdowner involved in the correspondence referred to has on his farm two birth cohort animals from a herd in which BSE was diagnosed. The herdowner has not accepted the valuation placed on these animals by my officials and has refused to permit an independent valuation of the animals. He has also objected to the definition of birth cohort as set out above. Under the terms of <Col N="783" /> S.I. 195 of 1990 my Department now intends to refer the dispute to an arbitrator whose decision is final and binding on all parties. The animals concerned can be compulsorily slaughtered under the provisions of section 17 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 47 of the 1999 Finance Act provides for the granting of a relief in respect of expenditure, incurred by an individual in the period 6 April 1999 to 31 December 2001, on the construction or refurbishment of owner-occupied residential accommodation in a qualifying rural area. The relief consists of an annual deduction from total income for tax purposes of an amount equal to, in the case of construction expenditure, 5 per cent and, in the case of refurbishment expenditure, 10 per cent of the expenditure incurred. The individual incurring the expenditure must be the first owner and occupier of the dwelling after the expenditure has been incurred. The relief available under the section may be claimed in each of the first ten years of the life of the dwelling following construction or refurbishment provided that the dwelling is the sole or main residence of the individual.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on a house qualifies for relief provided the following conditions are satisfied: the site is wholly within the designated area; the premises is used solely as a dwelling; the total floor area is not less than 38 square metres and not more than 210 square metres; if it is not a new house provided for sale, there is in force a certificate of reasonable cost; it complies with any conditions laid down by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to standards of construction and the provision of water, sewage and other services; it complies with any conditions laid down by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to standards for improvements and the provision for water, sewage and other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who wish to claim the relief in respect of qualified expenditure should apply to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for a certificate of reasonable cost in the case of self-build or a certificate of compliance in respect of qualified property purchased from a builder-developer. The application for a certificate of compliance can also be made by the builder-developer which is then passed on to the <Col N="784" /> purchaser of the property. Persons who intend to carry out refurbishment-conversion work on qualified property must inform the Department of the Environment and Local Government prior to the commencement of such refurbishmentconversion work.</P>
    <P>Application for the relief should be made to the taxpayer's Inspector of Taxes. Taxpayers who make their returns under self-assessment should claim their relief on their return of income in the appropriate year.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are in the process of preparing a comprehensive guide to the residential tax elements of the scheme. The guide will also detail the application process to be followed by taxpayers and it will be available in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the decision on whether to grant a tax clearance certificate in a particular case will depend on the legal requirements for tax clearance and Revenue's assessment of the tax position in the case. Clearly, an investigation into tax evasion could have an impact on the decision but this would depend on the nature of and stage reached in the investigation. However, if a tax liability arises from such investigation then tax clearance would be withheld until such liability is discharged.</P>
      <P>With reference to the granting of public sector contracts, all such contracts valued £5,000 or more require a tax clearance certificate. No such contract can be granted to any person who does not hold the necessary certificate.</P>

However, the qualifying medical criteria for the relief are set out in regulation 3, and include &ldquo;persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs&rdquo;. The question of whether a person meets the specified medical criteria to qualify under the scheme is a matter to be determined by the appropriate senior area medical officer who is responsible for the issuing of a primary medical certificate. In cases where the issue of the primary medical certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 to 179, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The health boards have completed the examination of their immunisation records in relation to the extent to which Trivax three-in-one vaccine from certain lots produced from batch no. 3741 was used in the period 1968-70.</P>
      <P>The health boards have identified a total of 295 records relating to children who received vaccine from three of the lot numbers concerned. Of these, 183 were in the Mid-Western Health Board area, 109 in the Southern Health Board area and three in the Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the health boards' responses with a view to determining what, if any, further action is appropriate in this matter.</P>
      <P>Glaxo Wellcome Limited, the successor to the company which produced the Trivax vaccine, has indicated to my Department that a variety of tests were used to analyse Trivax in the late 1960s and that all batches of Trivax released for sale complied with the mandatory requirements at that time. The company added that the results of all tests, mandatory and otherwise, together with expert advice which the company had sought, indicate that no other batch gave rise to the same level of potential concern as batch 3741.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheduling of appointments is a matter solely for the clinicians concerned. I am informed by the hospital management at St. Vincent's Hospital that the existing breast clinic deals mainly with women diagnosed with symptomatic breast disease or with a high risk of developing breast cancer. The current situation at St. Vincent's Hospital regarding women seeking screening and routine mammography is that when a request is received the x-ray department writes to both the patient and their general practitioner informing them that all appointments for mammograms are <Col N="790" /> filled by patients with symptomatic breast disease or with a high risk of developing breast cancer. If a patient is concerned with regard to the length of waiting times they are advised to contact their general practitioner who will then discuss their case with the relevant consultant radiologist at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the existing breast clinic at St. Vincent's is due to be completely upgraded as part of phase one of the £50 million general redevelopment programme approved for the hospital. Planning work on this development is now at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The level of activity at the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital has been steadily increasing in recent years and the hospital is continuing to put measures in place in order to maintain and improve services to patients. In terms of improving appointment schedules the majority of new patients now attend the morning clinic, as they may require access to diagnostic facilities on the same day. The majority of return patients are now seen in the afternoon. In addition, the hospital is continuing to operate specialist nurse-led clinics on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The hospital has also introduced a new computerised appointment system and has appointed an additional senior administrative officer who acts as liaison officer to improve patient services.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this package of developments will impact favourably on the level and quality of services to women attending the clinic.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the importance of ensuring a high quality service for women with breast cancer and for women who have symptoms of or problems which may indicate the possible presence of breast disease. I am also conscious that the welcome introduction of phase one of a national breast cancer screening programme will raise awareness of breast cancer generally. With this in mind I have asked the National Cancer Forum to establish a sub-group with the following terms of reference: to assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the forthcoming national breast cancer screening programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening; to make recommendations to me on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of diagnostic services to ensure equity of access to, and the highest quality in, the provision of diagnostic services for breast disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the sub-groups report and I will be considering the recommendations contained therein in the context of my <Col N="791" /> Department's overall financial commitments in the coming years.</P>

Article 16.1 of the regulations provides that a registered proprietor of a nursing home shall not seek any additional payment from a subvented patient for any service which is considered essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home. Among the services which are considered to be essential, and common practice in most nursing homes, is incontinence wear. If, therefore, a person is being subvented by a health board, as would generally be the case for a medical card holder, he or she would receive incontinence wear as part of his or her maintenance in the nursing home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1965 an arrangement has been in place whereby the air corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases. This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance. The service is also provided for the removal from the islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient. Since August 1991, the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine, which operates from Shannon Airport, is also available for air ambulance transport in cases of emergency.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the role which a dedicated air ambulance service could play in enhancing the effectiveness of the ambulance service. However, proposals for the development of an air ambulance service must be placed in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally and any initiative in this area must complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder programmes and other emergency response resources. As in other areas of health care, I am anxious that developments in this area are based on best evidence with regard to the health gain, effectiveness and value for money.</P>
      <P>The particular role of air ambulance was examined by the Standing Committee on Air Ambulance Services. The standing committee undertook a detailed examination of a number of independent proposals for the establishment of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service which were received from groups interested in this area. Meetings took place with a number of these groups, including a number of interested rural doctors.</P>
      <P>Following these meetings, officials of my Department have worked with other interested parties to clarify a number of issues regarding needs, costs and benefits deriving from having a dedicated and purpose-equipped air ambulance service. Work associated with these discussions, including the collation of information relevant to the potential benefits and costs of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service, is ongoing.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to further developing pre-hospital care services in the manner that will best improve the service for those who rely on such services and I have allocated an additional £2.7 million for developments in the field of pre-hospital care in 1999. This funding represents the largest ever increase in resources for this area and will assist considerably in improving emergency medical services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national task force on suicide put forward in its report, which was published in 1998, a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the national suicide prevention-reduction strategy commenced shortly after publication of the task force report with a partnership approach adopted between statutory and non-statutory services. My Department is also monitoring progress on the implementation of the task force recommendations by the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Environment and Local Government in so far as recommendations relate to these Departments.</P>
      <P>Central to the strategy has been the establishment of a suicide research group by the health boards to conduct research and advise health boards on measures to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide. The group was established last year and has met on several occasions. Health boards are also appointing resource officers to liaise with voluntary groups working in the area of suicide prevention and have established multi-disciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Priority has been given to the further development of mental health services for groups at risk of suicide, in particular the young and older age sectors of our population. I am concerned that greater accessibility to relevant health services be available to such groups at times of stress. I am committed to further developing consultant led child and adolescent and old age psychiatry ser<Col N="796" /> vices during 1999 which will assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. A total of £1.378 million has been provided to the health boards this year in respect of continued development of these services.</P>
    <P>The national task force on suicide acknowledged the role of the voluntary sector in suicide prevention and recommended closer liaison between the statutory and voluntary sectors. It also recommended that each health board develop measures to assess the efficacy and reliability of the delivery of voluntary services and where appropriate provide for the subvention of these services in tackling the issue of suicide and suicide prevention. I would suggest, therefore, that the organisation concerned contact the relevant health board with a view to discussing its requirements.</P>

      <P>A recent agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, effective from 1 March 1999, provides that a person awarded a new medical card can opt to remain with his or her doctor, providing that the doctor concerned meets certain requirements, for example as respects length of practice, and applies to his or her health board for a general medical services scheme contract under the provisions of the agreement.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries in this matter and understand that the patient was admitted to St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane as a voluntary patient on 15 April 1998.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday evening 28 April 1998 the patient visited a supermarket located adjacent to the hospital. Following his return to the hospital, a complaint was received from a female shop assistant employed in the supermarket regarding the behaviour of the patient in the shop earlier in the evening. The complaint was made to the hospital's security officer, who referred it to the nursing officer of the acute admission unit. The unit nursing officer contacted the proprietor of the supermarket to establish the circumstances giving rise to the complaint by the shop assistant. The proprietor indicated that she did not wish to make an official complaint about the incident. This was subsequently reported in the unit's day report book.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday morning 29 April 1998 the supermarket proprietor contacted the hospital manager regarding concerns she had about the incident on the previous evening. These concerns were immediately brought to the attention of the clinical director, chief nursing officer, assistant chief nursing officers and nursing officers and an investigation was commenced immediately by the hospital's management team.</P>
      <P>At 3.00 p.m. on 29 April 1998 the gardaí requested a meeting with the hospital's management team and this took place immediately. The gardaí advised that the patient was awaiting trial on serious sexual assault charges. Up to the time of this meeting with the gardaí the hospital authorities were not aware from any source that the patient was awaiting trial on serious sexual assault charges.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this additional information, the clinical director reviewed the patient and advised that he remain in the hospital notwithstanding his status as a voluntary patient. It is understood that the patient remained within the hospital until the date of his discharge, 19 May 1998. Following discharge the patient received out-patient care and treatment up to 15 August 1998.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are required, under section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, to make waste management plans with the objective, <i>inter alia</i>, of encouraging and supporting the recovery of waste.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997 require that waste management plans, in addressing the implementation of waste policy, have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the segregation and separate collection of recoverable wastes, including legal requirements on waste producers. In this regard, local authorities are empowered under section 35 of the 1996 Act to make bye-laws governing the segregation and presentation of household or commercial waste for collection.</P>
      <P>The October 1998 policy statement on waste management &ndash; Changing our Ways &ndash; recognises the key role of local authorities in the delivery of waste services and the achievement of a radical improvement in Irish waste management practice. It outlines policy requirements and objectives which should be taken into account in the waste management planning exercises currently under way, and offers guidance on a range of issues, including the technical aspects of planning. In this regard, the policy statement stresses the importance of employing waste collection systems which reflect the recycling and recovery scenarios being pursued and which will ensure the efficient collection of recoverable wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> It is evident that the regional waste management strategy studies and waste management plans currently being adopted by local authorities are guided by Changing our Ways, and address the scope for segregated waste collection for the purpose of facilitating a better waste recovery performance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a short meeting on 17 February 1999 between representatives of a company named Thermal Waste Management, TWM, and officials of my Department. This meeting, which took place in the offices of the Department, was attended by Mr. Martin Blake, managing director of the company, Mr. Brian Keogh of the Irish Productivity Centre, and Messrs Liam Whelan, <Col N="803" /> Eamonn Markey and Noel Casserly of the Department. Neither I, nor Minister of State Wallace, attended this meeting.</P>
    <P>In the course of this meeting, TWM outlined in broad terms the nature of the proposed project, which involved the thermal treatment of waste, and inquired about the availability of grant assistance in respect of the costs of a proposed feasibility study.</P>
    <P>The Department officials concerned outlined ongoing developments in relation to waste management policy and planning; indicated that the Department had no direct function in relation to the provision of waste infrastructure; described the current programme of grant assistance in respect of waste recycling and hazardous waste management facilities under the EU co-financed Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-1999, and indicated that available funding under this programme has been fully committed; provided information regarding the EU LIFE programme, which funds innovative demonstration projects related to the environment; and indicated that the Department of the Environment and Local Government did not operate any other relevant funding programme.</P>
    <P>On 19 February 1999, I had a meeting with Mr. Blake, who is a constituent, at my office in Trim. Mr. Blake informed me of TWM's proposal and, as would be normal in such matters, I indicated that he must pursue the matter formally with my Department. In March 1999, TWM submitted a formal proposal to my Department for grant assistance of £350,000 in respect of a research study related to the proposed thermal treatment project. TWM has been informed that there is no provision for such funding in my Department.</P>
    <P>The operation of a waste facility of the nature proposed would require an integrated licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function in relation to the grant or otherwise of such licences and is specifically precluded under the 1992 Act from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the EPA of its functions in particular circumstances.</P>

Each local authority will be required to draw up a four year programme to be agreed with my Department. Authorities have now been requested to set in train the necessary preparatory work in identifying schemes for inclusion in an overall housing programme as well as identifying any building land requirements. The housing construction programme for the current year for which the necessary funding is in place is unaffected by the proposal to introduce a multi-annual housing programme for the period 2000-2003.</P>

The scheme enables basic repairs to be carried out to houses which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. The task force on special housing aid for the elderly also assists with the improvement of the housing conditions of elderly persons living on their own and its funding <Col N="806" /> has been increased to £6 million in 1999, the highest level ever. It is not a condition for assistance under the task force that the applicant be eligible for or seeking local authority housing.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to waste management is set out in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium and related policy documents, and in the October 1998 policy statement entitled Changing our Ways. There is no current policy commitment in relation to the provision or otherwise of a national hazardous waste incinerator, and my Department has taken no action to encourage or promote any such project. Limited investment under the EU co-financed Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, was allocated to a number of projects involving the storage, treatment and recovery of hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>Under part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan which, among other things, will identify facilities currently available for the collection, recovery or disposal of hazardous wastes, and make recommendations regarding infrastructure, waste facilities and other physical resources considered to be necessary for the management of these wastes. I expect a draft of this national plan to be published shortly for public consultation. Policy in relation to the management of hazardous wastes will be reviewed when the national hazardous waste management plan is formally adopted by the EPA, later this year.</P>
      <P>High standards of environmental protection are applied to the incineration of hazardous waste, by means of the comprehensive integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the EPA under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.

      <P>The building regulations, which have been in effect since 1 June 1992 place a duty on persons constructing or extending public buildings to provide access for people with disabilities. Otherwise, the regu<Col N="808" /> lations generally do not apply to existing public buildings. The provision of access facilities to other existing buildings is a matter for the owners and occupiers of the building concerned.</P>
      <P>Departments and local authorities have been asked by my Department on a number of occasions over the years to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access facilities for disabled people to all buildings under their control. As part of their response to Delivering Better Government, Departments have undertaken to prepare customer action plans to improve the quality of services they provide to the public; access to public offices for people with disabilities is one of the issues to be addressed in this context.</P>
      <P>Local building control authorities are statutorily responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the regulations. It is, therefore, a matter for the authority to inspect public buildings to which the regulations apply. I have no power to issue a direction requiring inspections of any category of buildings whether they are covered by the building regulations or not. However, since my appointment as Minister in 1997, I have been urging local authorities to appoint building control officers and have sanctioned the necessary additional posts and increased building control fees. I now understand that 34 out of 37 authorities have appointed officers and the balance are in the process of making such appointments.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent comments by fire safety officers that recommendations emerging from the Stardust tragedy are still not implemented 18 years later; and if he will make an undertaking to Dáil Éireann that the necessary legislation will be put in place.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1982 report of the Stardust tribunal made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters. All of these recommendations have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services over the intervening period, with the support of successive Governments. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, the legislative framework, and emergency planning.</P>
      <P>With respect to capital investment, since 1981 almost £100 million has been provided from State funds to finance work on over 100 new or reconstructed fire stations, the purchase of 350 fire appliances and a wide range of emergency equipment and the development of a new national Computer Aided Mobilisation Project, CAMP.</P>
      <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, strengthened the overall statutory regime for enforcing fire safety. Regulations under the Act make the locking of exits and blocking of escape route from places of assembly an offence. Building regulations, which came into effect in June 1992 set out the requirements, including fire safety requirements, to be met in the design and construction of new buildings and material changes in existing buildings. With some limited exceptions, a fire safety certificate is now required for new buildings, extensions, and material alterations and changes of use. In December 1997 consolidated building regulations and building control regulations were made. These regulations came into operation on 1 July 1998.</P>
      <P>As regards staffing, there were about 30 professional posts in the local fire service prior to 1982, whereas now there are 121 such posts, with a greatly increased emphasis on fire prevention and fire safety. While the issue of staffing is generally a matter for each fire authority, my Department will consider any requests for additional staff in this area.</P>
      <P>A series of codes of practice and guidelines have been published by my Department providing fire safety advice for furnishings and fittings in places of assembly as well as fire safety advice for various classes of premises such as places of assembly, hotels, indoor concerts, guesthouses, flats, apartments, nursing homes, hostels and pre-schools. Operational guidelines covering training needs, the use of breathing apparatus, etc. have also issued to fire authorities. Work is continuing in my Department on the preparation of further advice and guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major improvements in fire service training have also taken place. Since the Fire Services Council was established in 1983, the council has held over 190 training courses at central level for over 3,600 local fire service personnel. This training supplements the training carried out locally by fire authorities. Major training facilities for the <Col N="810" /> fire service have been provided at several centres around the country including the Dublin Fire Brigade training centre at Marino.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council, established in 1988, promotes public awareness in relation to fire safety, as well as roads and water safety.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have developed plans to deal with major emergencies and my Department provides extensive advice and assistance to the authorities on this matter on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Three mobilisation and communications centres to handle all fire 999-112 calls are being developed in Limerick, Dublin and Castlebar. The Munster regional control centre in Limerick, which is capable of serving the whole of Munster is already in operation. The control centre for the eastern region is in operation and caters for the overall Dublin area and Counties Laois and Meath via an interim system. It is hoped that the remainder of Leinster and Counties Cavan and Monaghan will be brought into the system on a phased basis as early as possible. The western centre, based in Castlebar, with the capacity to serve Connaught and Donegal has recently been constructed and will be in operation shortly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these improvements have significantly strengthened the capacity of the service to respond to fires and other emergencies, and in fire prevention activities.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or the interest element of a mortgage repayment provided a person is not working for more than 30 hours per week. People who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who take up employment in certain circumstances can retain their SWA housing supplement for three years, subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month, provided their gross household income is less than £250 per week.</P>
      <P>A process of consultation has commenced with the social partners in relation to these matters in recent weeks. The purpose of these discussions is not to review SWA housing supplements in general but to consider the extent to which people on SWA housing supplements face unemployment traps, despite the arrangements for retaining these supplements, and to consider the introduction of an appropriate tapering arrangement to alleviate those unemployment traps. This is in line with a commitment in Partnership 2000 to consider arrangements for such a tapering arrangement in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>An initial meeting was held with the social partners on 16 April 1999 and a second meeting was held this morning. No definite conclusions have been reached so far and further meetings are planned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul, Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;button&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government came into office in June 1997, the multi-annual budgets for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 for this scheme had been set by the previous Rainbow Government at £2 million in each year. In 1997, I requested the Government to increase this £2 million for that year by £3 million to £5 million and that was agreed. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional <Col N="813" /> £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12.6 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Details of grants paid under the scheme to voluntary groups and organisations, including units of Community Alert, up to the end of 1998 are held in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The final report from the consultants has been received and is currently being examined in my Department. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The total amount of rent supplement paid in 1998 under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was £87.9 million. Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the last ten years. In recent years, this was mainly due to increases in rent levels rather than recipient numbers. Expenditure is expected to exceed £100 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee, under the aegis of the Department of Environment and Local Government, is currently examining the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to the local authorities. It comprises representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Finance as well as Environment and Local Government. I understand that the committee will report shortly. Any further development of the rent supplement scheme will be considered in the light of the findings of that report.</P>

      <P>This Department has no grant scheme for the installation of central heating in houses.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme is administered on behalf of this Department by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These exceptional needs payments &ndash; ENPs &ndash; may be made to assist with minor household repairs. They are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>There is also a facility available through the SWA scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. A person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments. An application for a heating supplement or an ENP may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>The allowance is payable at a standard weekly rate of payment which is equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment. Persons in receipt of reduced rates of payment have their payments increased to the maximum rate for the duration of their course of education. In addition, a cost of education allowance of £200, from September 1999, is payable at the start of each academic year. Participants also retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they had while in receipt of their relevant social welfare payment, such as Christmas bonus, fuel allowance, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education allowance is payable for the full duration of the course of education, including holiday periods. It is not a means-tested scheme and, consequently, participants may work <Col N="815" /> without affecting their payment. Similarly, any payments under the higher education grants scheme or in respect of ESF funded courses do not affect their weekly payment.</P>
    <P>The back to education allowance is quite different from the FÁS training allowance and contains features which are unique to it. The allowance has been improved significantly in recent years. There are no plans at the present time to further change the condition or the rates of payment under the scheme. Any such proposals would have to be considered in a budgetary context having regard to their cost implications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233, 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the court case referred to relates to the fact that Ireland did not transmit special area of conservation &ndash; SAC &ndash; sites to the EU Commission, and not to peatland sites in particular.</P>
      <P>The Irish Peatland Conservation Council's report recommending the inclusion of an additional 334 bog sites was considered by my Department. These additional sites are, in the main, degraded bogs proposed for designation under the non-active bog category. As Ireland has included large areas of active bog sites it is not proposed, at this stage, to include sites under the non-active category. It is considered that the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) provides for this approach as it requires member states to take account of proportionality and representativity.</P>
      <P>The actual position in relation to peatland sites is that my Department has proposed 30 raised bog sites containing approximately 8,000 hectares of intact raised bog, and 44 blanket bog sites containing approximately 250,000 hectares, for SAC designation in the initial list publicly advertised in 1997. The selection of these sites was made on the basis that the sites were the most important raised and blanket bog sites and provided a good representation of this habitat in Ireland. Irish mountain blanket bog has been subject to in-depth survey over the years and would not be a priority for further survey at this time.</P>

      <Col N="817" /> When the Irish list for all habitats has been completed and submitted to the EU it will then be discussed at a biogeographical regional seminar, at which non-Government organisations, the European Commission and my Department will be represented. This would be the appropriate forum at which the inclusion of additional sites should be discussed, as the EU Commission will base its judgment on whether our proposals are adequate to meet the national obligations set out in the Habitats Directive, on the discussions that take place in that forum.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment either way on peatland sites included in the Natura 2000 network by other EU member states. However, I can confirm that officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, have met with officials of Scottish National Heritage, its Scottish equivalent and that there is considerable agreement on the approach being adopted in relation to this habitat.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV systems as an aid to policing and to evaluate each application has received in excess of 31 applications, including one from Sligo. for the installation of Garda CCTV systems. At present six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing. The prioritised locations are as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The remaining applications are still under consideration by the committee and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as staffing and budgetary resources permit. A sum of £700,000 has been provided for in the Garda vote for the installation of Garda CCTV systems in 1999. This figure does not include any provision for Sligo as this application is still one of many currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and my Department. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera. Each application for a Garda CCTV system must also be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support.</P>

      <P>In addition to these six prioritised locations, there are also in excess of 25 other applications currently under consideration. While it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as staffing and budgetary resources permit, I am not in a position to say when this will be. There is a shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána which is impacting on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. I am having this problem addressed as a matter of urgency through the recruitment of a significant number of additional technicians and the recruitment process is actually under way at present. However given recruitment-selection procedures and training etc, realistically it will be some months before they will be available to commence work on existing or new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> It is also only fair to say, in this regard, that the commitment to existing schemes as well as those on the priority list, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>

      <P>My Department does not keep a record of the total number of applicants seeking the facility to which the Deputy refers. However, the number of such cases would be quite small. This is because the young adults in question would generally progress to the services provided by vocational training centres or other facilities which offer educational and other supports to young adults with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> The special schools and special classes generally cater for children with special needs from the age of four until the end of the school year in which the pupil reaches his or her eighteenth birthday. However, an application for an extension beyond the stated age limit will be considered having regard to the circumstances of the individual involved and an assessment of the educational benefit which would accrue from such extension.</P>

      <P>The position is that teaching service given outside the State cannot be reckoned for purposes of a pension under the teachers' superannuation schemes.</P>
      <P>This country has reciprocal agreements on social security with some other countries, including the United Kingdom, but these agreements do not extend to the area of occupational pensions. Any proposals for transferring occupational pension rights of teachers between countries would have to be considered in a public service-wide context and this is a matter for the Minister for Finance. I am informed that there are no proposals for such transfers at present.</P>
      <P>A teacher's previous membership of the Northern Ireland teachers' superannuation scheme should, of course, entitle the teacher to payment of a pension under the Northern Ireland scheme on reaching the qualifying age defined in the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department acts as the designated authority for the recognition of teacher qualifications in relation to the EU directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there are suitable arrangements in place for the recognition in this State of teacher qualifications awarded in Northern Ireland. In this regard, a scheme of provisional recognition operates at primary level whereby individuals who are recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in the United Kingdom or other EU member states may be appointed to a post in a primary school for a period of three years in advance of acquiring the Irish language qualification. On attainment of the Irish language qualification, such teachers are then recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in this State.</P>
      <P>Persons who are recognised as fully qualified second level teachers in the United Kingdom or other EU member states may be granted provisional recognition at second level in this State. In order to qualify for full recognition, such teachers must make up any substantial shortfalls identified in their qualifications by means of either passing an aptitude test or completing an adaptation period not exceeding three years and must satisfy the Irish language requirement. A second level teacher who does not satisfy the Irish language requirement at the time of appointment may be appointed provisionally to a teaching position subject to his or her obtaining the appropriate qualification within a period of three years.</P>
      <P>I consider that the establishment of teaching councils in both jurisdictions will enhance rather than hinder arrangements for recognition of teacher qualifications.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the national parents councils has, for many years, played a key role in education developments at national level through their involvement in working groups and other fora established by my Department. The national parents' councils provide representation for parents as partners in education on various Government-appointed <Col N="831" /> educational bodies and play an important role as a channel of communication between parents and my Department. At local level, parents play key roles in their schools through their membership of boards of management and through local parents' associations, many of which are affiliated to the national parents' councils.</P>
      <P>The key role of parents in this regard is further enhanced by the Education Act, 1998, which gives statutory underpinning to the national parents councils and which also gives parents a statutory right to establish parents' associations in schools.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, my Department has paid annual grants to both the primary and post-primary tiers of the council to assist them in fulfilling their role in meeting the needs of parents and adequately representing parents' views at national, local and European level. The level of the grant is currently £90,000 for each tier.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the participation of parents, through the national parents' councils, as partners in education, is a successful process which provides a forum for parents to make a genuine input into the education of the their children.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the one year full-time degree course leading to a Bachelor of Nursing which is offered by National University of Ireland, Galway to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background information, I would advise the Deputy that the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and <Col N="833" /> training which was introduced in October 1994 is funded by the Department of Health. Successful completion of this three year programme leads to a Diploma in Nursing Studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.  The Department of Health consulted with a number of colleges in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. A number of degree programmes were introduced on a self-financing part-time basis.  Part-time courses are not approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bachelor of Nursing course at National University of Ireland, Galway is the only full-time degree programme and I understand that the Minister for Health and Children is not in a position to provide funding for this course. This course has not been included within the scope of the free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case of Sarena Tansey and Others <i>v. </i>the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health, the Western Health Board, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any statement on the matter. Similarly, the course has not been included as an approved course under the terms of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to the recommendation of the commission on nursing that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses be based on a four year degree programme, the third year of which will involve a 12 month continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The nursing education forum has been established to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the new four year degree programme for the intake of nursing students in 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 to 274, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Individual schools test their own pupils' progress in mathematics using a variety of tests, including standardised tests. Information on pupils' progress, including those with significant difficulties in mathematics, is kept at school level. In the absence of valid and reliable information on the ability of individual pupils it is not possible to estimate the numbers of pupils who underachieve in mathematics.</P>
      <P>The results of surveys conducted by my Department during the 1970s and early 1980s on the primary mathematics programme showed that the great majority of pupils in the classes tested (second, fourth, sixth) attained mastery on those mathematics objectives involving basic computational skills. The main deficiencies indicated by the surveys were in relation to conceptual understanding and the solving of word problems,</P>
      <P> The 1995 third international mathematics and science study involved Irish pupils in third and fourth classes. The results showed that the mean mathematics scores of Irish pupils in both class grades were higher than the corresponding international mean mathematics scores. Among countries involved which satisfied various sampling criteria, Irish pupils were placed seventy of 16 countries in the third class survey and sixth of 17 countries in the fourth class survey.</P>
      <P>In May 1999, a survey of the mathematics attainments of pupils in fourth class is being conducted by the educational research centre, Drumcondra, and the inspectorate of my Department. In addition, arrangements are being made at present to extend the remedial teaching service to all schools. Also, the guidelines on remedial teaching are being revised and particular attention will be given to the remedial teaching of mathematics in this revision. There are practical steps in providing for pupils with learning difficulties in mathematics and in tackling underachievement.</P>
      <P>A revised programme in mathematics has been drawn up by the national council for curriculum and assessment as part of the overall revision of the primary school curriculum. The phased implementation in schools of this revised curriculum will begin in the next school year and will be supported by an extensive in-career development programme for teachers.</P>
      <P>Changes in approach in the revised mathematics programme include an increased emphasis on conceptual understanding and on a more structured approach to the solving of problems based on real life situations. These initiatives will be expected to raise standards and improve achievement in mathematics among primary school students generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of electronic calculators will formally begin in fourth class and the utilisation of appro<Col N="836" /> priate computer software in the delivery of the programme will be encouraged. Carefully structured work with visual and three-dimensional materials, coupled with the correct use of mathematical language, will form an important base for the development of the children's understanding of mathematics.</P>
    <P>These innovations are intended both to increase the children's enjoyment of mathematics and to further enhance the levels of attainment currently being achieved in primary schools.</P>

The level of service provided is based on the duration of the child's absence from school and my Department's inspectorate's assessment of the needs of the child. Home tuition is provided in response to specific applications for the service. It normally operates only for the duration of the school year in which it is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the children to which the Deputy refers, home tuition was sanctioned for one child until December 1996 and for the other child until the end of the 1996-97 school year. I understand that the decision to withdraw the service from one of the children in December 1996 was based on the fact that the child's attendance at school had increased to a satisfactory level. My Department has not received an application for home tuition in respect of either child since the 1996-97 school year. However, it remains open to the <Col N="837" /> parents of these children to apply for a renewal of a home tuition service.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of clerical and caretaking services. This is the scheme under which Scoil Mhuire gan Smál is assisted towards the cost of these services.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil &ndash; £15 for each service &ndash; based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The level and extent of service provided is a matter for local school management who have discretion as to how the grants are to be applied for these services.</P>
      <P>In September 1997 the qualifying enrolment threshold for inclusion in the scheme was reduced to its current level of 195 pupils. Scoil Mhuire gan Smál met the qualifying criteria at that time and has been included in the scheme since then.</P>
      <P>Scoil Mhuire gan Smál is currently in receipt of £6,420 per annum &ndash; 214 pupils x £30 &ndash; towards the cost of clerical and caretaking services, which is the maximum amount available to the school under the current terms of the scheme. I am happy to assure the Deputy that the school will continue to receive assistance under this scheme.</P>

      <P>In the current school year, of the 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the combat poverty agency and the education research centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged area scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the position of Mooncoin vocational school will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged scheme.</P>
