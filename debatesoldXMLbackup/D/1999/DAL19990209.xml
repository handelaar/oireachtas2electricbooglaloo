    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Action Plan on Implementing the Information Society has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. It presents a framework which identifies a wide range of measures considered necessary or desirable to implement the information society in Ireland. While responsibility for each of the action points typically rests with one or more Ministers, Departments or agencies, the work on any one action point could have a significant bearing on other action points in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan sets out action points under a number of headings. The first is telecommunications infrastructure. We made important progress in this area during 1998, with full liberalisation of the market from 1 December 1998, 13 months ahead of schedule. The plan envisages further progress during 1999, mainly under the auspices of the Minister for Public Enterprise, including the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, the sale of Cablelink, and work on <Col N="3" /> upgrading our international connectivity and on extending broadband services.</P>
    <P>The plan also contains measures on the development of electronic commerce and business opportunities. In particular, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the industrial development agencies will produce an action programme in this important area shortly. Under enabling measures the plan deals with issues such as providing access to the Internet in public places, such as public libraries, for people who do not have access from their homes or workplaces.</P>
    <P>As we move more and more towards electronic commerce, there will be greater need for services such as digital certificates to enable people to communicate securely and with certainty over the Internet. The Department of Public Enterprise will work to identify suitable operators in this activity and to put the necessary legal framework in place. Implementing the information society will also require legislative changes in a number of areas under the responsibility of a number of Ministers. These include the area of digital certificates, admissability of electronic evidence in court proceedings, data protection, the Telecom Éireann initial public offering and preparing for digital TV.</P>
    <P>A large part of the action plan concerns information and communications technologies and the delivery of public services. It covers provision of information using modern technologies, such as the Internet and electronic mail, and reaffirms the Government's commitment to greater use of these technologies in the mainstream of public administration. It also envisages a range of projects to provide public services electronically from a number of Departments and agencies. The plan also states that a detailed examination of deeper integration of public services, sometimes referred to as re-engineering or re-inventing Government, will be carried out during 1999.</P>
    <P>Topics such as raising awareness and education are covered in a section headed &ldquo;support areas where action is needed&rdquo;. The information society commission, for example, in conjunction with IBEC, is implementing a major campaign aimed at raising awareness of information society issues among small and medium enterprises. Finally, a section headed &ldquo;taking the work forward&rdquo; envisages that an interdepartmental group, supported by a policy development team, will monitor implementation of the action plan. In addition, the plan provides for further assessment of overall resource requirements to ensure satisfactory implementation of all aspects of the plan.</P>
    <P>I trust I have given Deputies a feel for the contents and objectives of the plan. In agreeing the plan at Cabinet, I asked each Minister to take a close personal interest in ensuring that any aspects of the plan which concern his or her area of responsibility are delivered as part of the overall strategy to ensure that Ireland is truly a digital age country. Many reports have emerged in <Col N="4" /> recent months which contain recommendations on how this should happen. The action plan will help to translate those recommendations into concrete progress.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the SMI programme of action on information technology, the Deputy is aware from my reply of 16 December that a number of the recommendations contained in the SMI working group report on information technology were taken up in the work of the interdepartmental implementation group on the information society. It was the work of this group which led to the adoption of the action plan, so it is fair to expect that implementation of that plan should result in progress being made on a number of the issues identified in the SMI working group report.</P>
    <P>The report contains a number of recommendations in relation to the acquisition and retention of skilled IT staff. In December 1998, the Department of Finance reached agreement with the unions on a set of once-off exceptional measures to retain skilled IT staff engaged in year 2000 work until that work is completed. This includes scope for re-assignment of suitable administrative staff to IT work and, where it is deemed appropriate, payment of a loyalty bonus in April 2000 to skilled IT staff. Four IT officers in my Department who are working on the year 2000 issue will qualify for special bonus payments. No additional staff have been assigned for year 2000 purposes. Consultants have been engaged where the required expertise in not available in-house.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations of the SMI working group report, including those relating to staffing issues, will shortly be considered by the SMI implementation group in the context of completing the SMI programme of action on information technology. I expect that a report will be submitted to Government in early June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his long reply. Does he agree that access to the Internet in one's home will become one of the great inequalities among families over the next ten years? Will he further agree that those who do not have such access will be almost as cut off from modern life as people who do not have access to a motor car currently are from the benefits of modern life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be true. It will not be possible to provide such access in homes initially. However, modern technology is developing at a fast pace and, like me, Deputy Bruton will be aware of the changes which have already occurred, particularly the increased linkage of the traditional TV set with the Internet. When the technology moves into a more affordable price range, people will be able to cope.</P>
      <P>In the meantime it is incumbent on us to make them available in schools, community centres, public libraries and other venues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that a child who has a computer at home has a great <Col N="5" /> advantage over other children whose only access may be a minute or two on the school computer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do believe that. That is the reason the Government, mainly under the Minister for Education and Science, has been driving technology into schools as much as possible. I welcome the fact that a large number of companies in the private sector are joining with boards of management in doing that. There are several projects in both rural and urban areas which have resulted in very modern computer rooms in schools. A child who has the opportunity to practise and build up his or her capabilities on a computer at home has a clear advantage over a student who gets only limited time in the school computer room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the four members of staff who are getting bonuses to deal with the year 2000 problem, is the Taoiseach satisfied that each one of the software applications in his Department, not just the computers and the original programmes, will not only be corrected as to dates but that each of those applications will be tested in operation before the end of the year? Is the Taoiseach satisfied there will not be any breakdown in any of the software applications of any of the programmes in his Department as a result of failure to test all of them adequately? Has he received personal assurances on this point from his staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The work on the year 2000 difficulties in my Department is almost complete. All of the programmes and the software have been tested. Extensive tests have been carried out over the past months but a few jobs remain to be done. The alarm system and some other systems have to be completed &ndash; some problems have been identified in those areas. As of now, almost everything is complete but in dealing with the year 2000 problems one hopes nothing has been missed. However, in so far as everything has been double checked and tested, we are in a good position at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. He said that additional staff will not be needed but is there any area of work in his Department which will have to be cut back to allow the current staff deal with the year 2000 problem, as is happening in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to supplementary welfare allowance recipients? If additional staff are not required, are the staff currently working on the Y2K problem in touch with the global 2000 co-ordinating group which has asked governments to become involved in this work? Does the Taoiseach's Department qualify for a red, yellow, green or black card in terms of its readiness for the Y2K problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work in the Department is almost complete and it is hoped the remaining <Col N="6" /> work will be completed before the end of May. Additional burdens have been placed on staff and some staff in my Department and other Departments have worked weekends. The staff are working to the co-ordinating group under the Minister for Finance who is dealing with the overall problems. We have followed best international standards and the Deputy will be aware that the committee is made up of both departmental and outside staff. The Minister for Finance has answered questions here about that work on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>The agreement with the general council of the trade unions was not just about money. If staff had specific knowledge of the year 2000 problem and were promoted they could stay in their posts and the other posts would be approved as supernumerary. If they worked in a non-IT post but had IT expertise, they could come back to the original job. I am grateful for the way the trade unions and the individuals with expertise have worked to make this possible. This has been done in my own and in other Departments and I appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister of State with responsibility for overseeing the Government's response to the problem is now a candidate in the European elections, does the Taoiseach intend to replace the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy? Does the Government intend insuring that every household in the country gets a checklist of domestic items which could be vulnerable to year 2000 failure, items such as alarm systems, washing machines, central heating systems and fridge freezers? Is anyone working to inform the ordinary householder that they are likely to be exposed to risk as a result of embedded chips in a range of normal domestic appliances? If so, when will householders get hard information upon which they can act? We are only ten and a half months away from the impact of this potential catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully it will not be a catastrophe. The Deputy may have seen the television series in which the Information Society was involved in highlighting the issues. This was seen as an effective way for the Information Society to get practical advice across to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The information should be issued with every ESB bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at more extensive ways. If I had been asked about this before I became more involved, I would not have thought that clocks, alarms, gates and so on would be affected. The Deputy is asking me if there is a way of making knowledge about embedded chips more widely available, and I will try to find out. At this stage the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is still deeply involved in this work and he has displayed huge commitment to it. I have no reason to replace him at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He just wants a few zeros on his salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an indication of Government priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>No country or company is an island when it comes to this problem. Has the Taoiseach ensured that the Government has international links with groups such as the Global 2000 Co-ordination Group? I am told that Bank of Ireland and AIB are the only two Irish institutions involved with it and they are only on the mailing list. Has the Government established formal links with this group which is seeking Government co-operation around the world? What other international links are there to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the problem? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Treacy, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have worked closely with such groups. Many of the programmes to combat this problem were written by Irish people. Irish people have made a huge effort to ensure international co-ordination. I am not aware of red, yellow or blue cards, but we are co-operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if we are to give concrete expression to the information society there is a necessity for us to develop a leading edge digital park? The absence of broad band digital capacity has cost us jobs. It will have to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. It is part of the programme to which a recent Government decision applies. The Minister for Finance referred to that first during his budget speech, and the Minister for Public Enterprise carried this matter on in statements. The action plan envisages agreement with a global connectivity provider which should be reached in the first half of this year. There are discussions on the formation of a consortium to run the relevant infrastructure that should go in parallel with this. The nationwide broad band plan requires estimates to be made by the end of next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under its terms of reference, the National Competitiveness Council is required to prepare and submit reports to the Taoiseach on challenges facing the enterprise sector and the policy responses required to meet them. Technical amendments to the terms of reference proposed by Forfás are currently being considered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The sole purpose of any amendments that may be made will be to reflect the role and functions of the council with greater clarity. They will not impact on the council's ongoing programme of work.</P>
    <P>When the council members were appointed, the term of office of members was not specified. Proposals to clarify the position are also being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that while the council's report on information technology and telecommunications was quite specific in its recommendations, the report on skills was not? Will he consider asking the council to make specific recommendations, even if they are controversial and all may not be adopted? Specific recommendations provide a better focus for Government action and our debate than compromised generalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter before Christmas, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been following up some of those issues. Some of the statements made can be implemented; the Department of Education and Science, FÁS, the Business-Education Partnership programme and graduate courses are working on these. Others are not so clear, and Deputy Bruton's points have already been raised with the council. I will make sure that that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One understands that a council like this, which is multi-representational, has difficulties in reaching consensus. However, it might be better off saying it has not reached a consensus and that there are two specific views rather than trying a verbal fudge to reconcile both positions. That is of no use to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions have to be made on the skills issue, given its importance. If there are two points of view it is no harm to know them, but in fairness to the chairman, I know he has been doing his utmost to drive this issue forward, to get decisions and recommendations that can be implemented and then to pressurise the Government to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider asking the council to do a specific report on the competitiveness of Irish agriculture with particular reference to the fact that some current EU policies may be inimicable to competitiveness in the widest and most vigorous sense of that term? Will the Taoiseach consider asking the council to do a long-term study of what is necessary to ensure that Irish agriculture is competitive not only in the post Agenda 2000 world but after the next round of World Trade talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this issue. I understand Forfás provides the secretariat of the council, and that body has done some research on this matter which will be discussed at <Col N="9" /> a forthcoming council meeting. I have had many meetings with the agricultural social partners, and the Minister and I have had preliminary discussions on the post-Agenda 2000 situation and the round of GATT talks, which commences towards the end of this year. We should be doing a study that looks at the next ten years and beyond, and my Department has been looking at this issue. However, that will not take away from some of the preliminary work Forfás has done, which will be discussed at the next council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the approach to agricultural policy and competitiveness, in Europe and Ireland, has been driven exclusively by short-term considerations, that there is currently no long-term perspective for European agriculture, and therefore any young person contemplating a career in farming has nothing to go on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties in agriculture, not only in this country, need to be addressed, there is no argument about that. I spoke to Commissioner Fischler on Friday and he would argue that the Commission's extensive examination of agriculture into the medium term shows far better prospects than are visible in the short-term, and with Agenda 2000 and the GATT round stretching into early next year, he believes the policy framework will be far better. The Government would like to see a comprehensive study to cover the next ten to 20 years. This has not been done for a long time. It should be along the lines of the Culliton report on industry which was done about ten years ago. That study would be well worth doing.</P>

This rep<Col N="10" /> resents expenditure on eight projects or engagements, and the average spend on each was £16,052. In all, ten consultancies were commissioned by the Information Society Commission, the National Economic and Social Forum and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, at a total cost of £147,442, averaging £14,744 per consultancy.

In the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, one IT consultant, Manorhamilton Services, is engaged for the provision of technical assistance. The total cost is £53,000 from August 1997 to the end of 1999. The consultancy for the Referendum Commission related to the work done for the referendum last summer.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, to some degree at least, the appointment of consultants is a way of circumventing Civil Service pay guidelines and to get work which should normally be done within the Civil Service done at a higher cost than if public servants were employed to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases that might be the case but in these instances it clearly is not. Many of these consultants are people with expert knowledge who can bring something special to a project, although I cannot say whether that is true of all of them. The Deputy could be right in that a consultant could spend 18 months working on nothing except a particular project, whereas a normal public servant cannot do that. People engaged on these consultancies are there to complete it as quickly as possible and to dedicate themselves to it. A civil servant is normally never in a position to do that, particularly at senior level &ndash; none of our senior civil servants can be sure, when he or she comes to work in the morning, what he or she will be doing at lunch time, never mind at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I recognise the necessity for the hiring of consultants, particularly in the IT area. That field is moving forward rapidly and it is difficult for a permanent establishment to have the necessary expertise within its ranks. It is clear from the Taoiseach's reply that the bulk of the activity appears to be in that general area. I do not wish to curtail the necessity for flexibility in the Taoiseach's office, but it is essential to ensure we get value for money. Can the Taoiseach assure the House the consultants' reports and contracts, which no doubt were advertised in the proper way, will be subject to an evaluation by the Comptroller and Auditor General in due course? This would ensure the critical test of value for money is applied to these consultancy contracts, none of which appears to be excessive given the figures quoted by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I can say yes to that. My Department complies with EU regulations governing contracts and follows the guidelines of the Department of Finance in awarding public contracts. Before awarding a consultancy contract, and except in cases where there are clear reasons for not doing so, the Department provides for competitive tendering by inviting at least three firms to tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to the House on 30 September 1998, a Partnership 2000 Working Group on Basic Income was set up under the aegis of my Department. The group has commissioned a study which is being carried out in two phases. The overall purpose of the study is to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system. Draft reports from the consultants on the first phase of the study, which examines the costs and distribution analysis of a basic income, were received as expected at the end of October.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the methodologies involved in costing and analysing the distributional effects of a basic income are complex and time consuming. The research team comprising the ESRI and Professor Charles Clark of St. John's University, New York have been engaged in reconciling a number of issues which are fundamental to the conclusions. The Working Group on Basic Income has provided information and assistance to the consultancy team in recent weeks in addressing costings, taxation and the other issues involved.</P>
      <P>As a result, the first phase is being finalised, incorporating material now available in respect of the 1998 outturn on relevant variables, and will be presented to a meeting of the working group before the end of the month. The second phase of the study, which will consider the dynamic effects of basic income, will then move ahead rapidly. Progress on the study was reported to the social partners at their recent quarterly meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study and the report of the Partnership 2000 working group will enable the Government to examine the matter. It is intended that a Green Paper will be published, as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium. As the two phases of the study constitute an important input into the preparation of the Green Paper, it is not <Col N="13" /> possible at this stage to indicate the precise date of publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the phase of work that has been completed, what tax rate would have to be applied to taxable income to finance a basic income under which no existing beneficiary of social welfare payments in respect of insurance or assistance would lose out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A draft report was put forward. The working group put a number of cases to the experts and had to rewrite and configurate the report. Different methodologies were used, but it would be unfair to comment on a tax rate until the report is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the report deal with the tax rate that would have to be applied on income to pay for this and, if so, does it deal with it on the assumption that there will be a flat single rate or two or three rates of income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the report deals with the tax rate on income. However, I do not know what mechanism will be used to implement it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be familiar with this subject, which has been abroad for a long period and which is part of the Partnership 2000 agreement. Does the study, with which the Taoiseach will be somewhat familiar refer to residency requirements or will eligibility to a basic income be open to all EU citizens who choose to live in Ireland?</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach state that the first stage of the report or the full report will be completed by October?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question, I do not know what route has been taken. I assume the study will suggest that anybody should be able to claim eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume so, but I have not yet seen the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, unfortunately the group was not able to overlap the two phases of the work because so many changes took place during the discussions of the working group on the first report. The same individuals, representatives of the ESRI and Professor Clark, will be involved in the second phase, which can be completed by October. Because the study was carried out under Partnership 2000, we <Col N="14" /> will be obliged to wait to see what will be the view of the social partners on it. As already stated, they were provided with updated information at the recent quarterly meeting but we must wait for their reaction to the report.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn stated, this is a complex area. I am aware that in other countries people tended not to proceed with these kinds of studies. We must wait to see how it works. The study emerged from the CORI proposal, with which I was familiar, and it has moved on from that. I have no intention of prejudging the situation, but, one way or the other it will form a useful part of the examination. That will be more interesting than when it originally began because we have introduced changes to the tax credits system. The scope for directing and shaping developments is now different from what it was a number of years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party appreciates the carrying out of this study because it is important in terms of the changes needed. Does the Taoiseach believe the timeframe by which the study is to be completed will be adhered to, given that he has been replying to similar questions tabled by me and other Members for more than a year? Will the study incorporate a revised means of collecting tax as part of its overall remit perhaps, for example, by shifting the burden of tax from income on to consumption as CORI suggested in its study? Will the feasibility of the guaranteed basic income be evaluated against the current crises affecting child care needs, those who work in the home, carers, etc.? Will that form part of the group's work or will the study be merely an academic exercise? Will it take into account the needs of society and suggest ways that change can be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the changes to the tax credit system, these studies, such as the recent child care report, are useful and can be used in conjunction with each other to improve the system and make it more equitable. However, the fact that a report is made does not mean its recommendations will result in expected benefits.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the delay on a number of occasions. I advised him last September that matters would proceed more speedily. Attempts are being made to produce a much more analytical report and enormous work has been put into achieving this. It would be better if a comprehensive and thorough analysis were produced, even if it takes time. A draft report was ready by last autumn, but the submission to the working group and the attempt to relate it to the CORI proposal, the original basis of the project, led to an enormous number of changes as attempts were made to reconcile the items to be included in the tax base and to address other issues, such as the services to be defined. In view of this, I am unable to indicate a definite date, but I know the consultants are anxious to conclude matters this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Given what they are meant to do, tax credits are very important. They will not affect only the basic income. Their purpose is to simplify the system and make it fairer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with their impact on the system. Does the Taoiseach consider they make the concept of basic income redundant or easier to achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe they make it redundant. Had tax credits been introduced at the time of its report, it is probable that CORI would have made different proposals. When it published its original proposals it sought a basic income for each individual and a basic allowance for each child. It made these proposals at a time when it was recognised that the tax system favoured those at the top and a means was sought to address that. CORI is now endeavouring to ascertain if it is possible to have a basic income in today's society. I am not sure about the idea and will await the publication of the reports.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreed contract for the publication of the entire Statute Book provided for the production and delivery of 1000 CDs. This was on the basis of a single release which would include Acts and <Col N="16" /> statutory instruments. In the event 100 copies of a CD containing Acts only were released on 17 December 1998. A further 500 copies were ordered shortly afterwards and have been received. This first release was also made available on the Internet. The second release under the original contract of 400 disks containing Acts, statutory instruments and the chronological tables, 1922-98, will be available in May.</P>
    <P>However over and above this, 800 further disks, containing Acts only, will be received on 15 February. In addition, the Incorporated Law Society has ordered 2,000 copies of this disk. This will bring the total number of disks containing Acts only produced to 3,400. The total cost of the contract to make the Statute Book available in electronic form is £825,000.</P>
    <P>In January, the Office of the Attorney General became aware of a fault in the batch of CDs sold between 17 and 31 December. Pages of text from 11 Acts had not been included on the CD-ROM. This fault was rectified on the second batch of disks received. A notice, offering an exchange for the faulty disk, was placed in the newspapers on 4 February. Before the first batch had gone on sale the contractor had assured the Office of the Attorney General that the disks were free of any major fault. The Office of the Attorney General has asked the contractor to explain the cause of the fault and has insisted that improved quality assurance measures be put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. He will be aware that I raised this matter before. Why was the ordering so botched in that only 100 copies were released before Christmas? Why was no realistic market research done and why could the demand not be met, given that it was out before Christmas? If it costs £825,000, why was the ludicrously low price of £20 set for the CD-ROM when the market would have borne a much higher price, such as £100? It would cost an arm and a leg to buy bound volumes of Irish statute law from 1922 to 1997. Did anyone in the Government Information Service and the Attorney General's office ask the information society body, to which the Taoiseach referred earlier in questions, about this? It seems a good idea, which originated with the previous Attorney General, has been grossly mismanaged by the present Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The second phase of the project will be in May this year when further copies of the Statute Book will be released. The only error was that 11 parts of the Acts were released without being checked conclusively.

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication of the ministerial task force report in October 1996, the Government allocated £10 million in 1997 to support the implementation of nearly 230 separate initiatives and action plans which were prepared by the local drugs task forces. These task forces were set up to develop and implement an integrated response to the drug problem in their areas and involved local communities in the planning, design and implementation of that response. Funding for this initiative is held in the Vote of my Department and is transferred on request as projects become operational to other Departments and agencies which are acting as channels of funding to the approved projects. Approximately £5.6 million has been drawn down by these Departments and agencies to date and 80 per cent of the projects are currently drawing down funding. An important feature of the initiative is the engagement of local communities in the design and planning of strategies to respond to the drug problem in their area and in the implementation of approved projects. In the majority of cases this has been undertaken by voluntary and community groups in partnership with relevant statutory agencies and assisted by the local drugs task forces. It is hoped this approach will assist the viability and sustainability of these projects and facilitate their future mainstreaming. However, a vital prerequisite to achieving this is the need to develop the capacity of community and voluntary organisations to deliver locally based drug programmes and services.</P>
      <P>In the task force areas where strong community structures were already in place prior to setting up the initiative, the emphasis in the action plan was on developing and expanding these structures. Accordingly in such areas it was possible to get the majority of approved projects up and running relatively quickly. It is notable that these areas either had a long tradition of community involvement in responding to the drug problem or had a local partnership company which had established a strong committee network in the area. Conversely in the areas where community networks were less developed, the emphasis in the plans was on building up these structures and as a result it has taken longer to get projects off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four principal features which have impacted on the speed at which projects are being established are that they are being designed to address gaps in current service provision, which means that in many instances they have had to be designed and planned from scratch. In many instances appropriate local management structures have had to be put in place as a prerequisite to ensuring that the projects will work effectively, meet their objectives and are sustainable with a <Col N="20" /> view to their future mainstreaming. There was a lack of suitable infrastructure or premises from which programmes or services could be run and in a number of instances, there was local opposition to such services due to a misunderstanding as to their purpose, which is to provide back-up and support to the care and aftercare services being provided by the health boards. There is a shortage of appropriately trained personnel to deliver drug programmes and services and there is potential competition which this can cause between projects. The local drugs task forces, the Departments and agencies acting as channels of funding and the national drugs strategy team all play an important role in ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring of group projects. The task forces assist in the planning and design of the projects and submit regular reports to the national drugs strategy team on progress in their implementation. The team members and the statutory representatives on the task forces are making every effort to assist the projects in overcoming problems and difficulties inhibiting the start up of projects being funded through their Department or agencies.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the £10 million provided by the Government to support initiatives in the local drugs task force areas will be fully spent and the initiatives will make a considerable positive impact on the lives of the communities concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that nearly 40 per cent of the 1996 budget allocation for the initiatives to combat drugs remains unspent and that £4 million was left unspent last year? The Minister said difficulties were experienced in local communities when centres were being set up. Are there procedures in place for consultation with local people prior to the setting up of treatment centres? It has been suggested that more could be done to get the local people on board and the drugs task force has a role to play in allaying the fears of the communities. What action has been taken in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raises a number of issues and I will deal with them as precisely as I can. With regard to the drawdown of funding, the task forces were established in 1996 arising from the ministerial report and funding of £10 million was provided in 1997. There are somewhere in the order of 230 specific individual projects. These projects are essentially community based and that is one of the strengths of the approach in establishing the national drugs strategy team and in empowering local communities through the provision of resources. The projects were put forward and eventually approved in mid and late 1997. Projects were given an interim approval in mid 1997 and final approval by the end of 1997. The promoters had to come together in terms of putting in place the infrastructure which in some instances could involve seeking planning per<Col N="21" /> mission for buildings and so on. There were misunderstandings in the local communities which had to be overcome.</P>
      <P>There was the question of the recruitment of specialist staff by the individual projects which took some time. I assure the Deputy that there were no delays by the national drugs strategy team in making funding available through the channels of funding that were laid down on the original establishment of local drugs task forces. It has taken some local groups and organisations time to get up and running in order to draw down the funding. However, an erroneous impression may have been created that such funding remains unspent because it has not been drawn down. That is not the case because many local groups draw it down through the funding agency as required, otherwise they could not plan their projects, whether infrastructural or educational.</P>
      <P>The funding continues to be drawn down at an increasing rate. It is interesting that more than 90 per cent of the funding which has not been drawn down relates to infrastructure. The Deputy asked what local health boards or local drugs task forces are doing to engage communities in the consultation process. A crucial difficulty relates to the expenditure of the final moneys for the provision of infrastructure for treatment and services, etc. There have been considerable objections to the provision of treatment facilities and services, some in my own area and those of other Members. These are being gradually overcome through the adoption of a more positive approach by the relevant health boards. In most cases, it is the Eastern Health Board and it engages more communities in consultation with the support of the local drugs task force.</P>
      <P>Problems still remain and I appeal to all Members, where they are confronted with the possible provision of a treatment facility or service in their areas, to give leadership in encouraging communities to accept it while at the same time demanding that the local health board and drugs task force operate properly and provide representation on monitoring committees, etc., in these communities.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment to spend all the money allocated in 1996? He stated that communication with local communities has not been very successful so far and I agree that we should give leadership. He also stated in his reply that there has been a shortage of trained personnel. How much is spent on training and how many people are currently in training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to provide a precise figure to the Deputy and I do not want to mislead her in that regard. However, I assure her that a number of local drugs task forces put forward proposals in which training was a significant element. I refer her to an organisation called URRUS which has been very successful in training community leaders and activists. I frequently <Col N="22" /> present certificates to successful trainees who have come through the process. However, I will make the information requested available to the Deputy together with details of individual programmes.</P>
      <P>She referred to engaging communities and I agree with her. I am responsible for the national drugs strategy and represent an area where a local drugs task force exists. The Eastern Health Board has been very industrious in attempting to provide facilities, etc.. There were difficulties in the past in terms of communicating with communities. Such communities should not come to the conclusion that if they are consulted they have a veto on proposals to provide treatment facilities and services. That is not the case and where it is shown, through consultation, that treatment facilities and services are required they must be provided. Communities cannot, for different reasons, turn their backs on other members of the same communities who require treatment in a local setting. Facilities which are provided should be properly managed by a monitoring committee. This should include members of the community to be successful and not give rise to difficulties. There are many examples in the areas most beset by the effects of the misuse of hard drugs.</P>

The EHB has established up to 40 treatment centres in recent years across Dublin in areas where they are most needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot provide that information because it is a health board issue, but I will bring the Deputy's inquiry to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. There are 12 local drugs task forces in Dublin and one in Cork. The EHB will establish a further nine treatment centres, although some are subject to the planning process. There has been significant provision at local level. Local drugs task forces have been pivotal in developing, and assisting in the development of, treatment facilities and services. They make a considerable impact on the provision of services, facilities, counselling, etc., not just for the drug user but for his or her family and the wider community.</P>

      <P>One of the options which I have explored in consultation with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation for the future financing of tourism destination marketing is the possible introduction of a modest visitor levy in line with practice in many other countries. This, of course, is without prejudice to the case for continued EU funding for tourism marketing under the next round of Structural Funds. While my deliberations on future options have progressed well, no final decision have yet been taken on this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his good wishes and also hope that I am here for at least two years. The Minister stated that no decision has been taken regarding the tax but the perception is that it will be put in place. Will the Minister put the industry at ease and say that he will not introduce this tax? Ireland is perceived as an expensive destination because it is an island. Does he agree that the introduction of such a tax would encourage visitors to come into Ireland through airports and ports in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We agreed to establish a tourism marketing fund in our programme for Government. How that is established appears to be the problem. This does not mean that we will give up our request for Structural Funds for the entire industry. However, we must be realists and accept it has been indicated that there will be a reduction in EU funding for this area. We will be between £10 million and £15 million short in terms of marketing. This country is currently at the top of the European tourism league. Our figures are phenomenal. By the year 2006 the figures show that eight million people will visit this island. That will be worth £4.3 billion in revenue, making tourism the largest single industry in the country. Good policies have been pursued by different Administrations over recent years and we have kept the industry to the fore. I will not take my foot off the pedal and allow the marketing area to lose out on funding. If there is a crisis or if budgetary cutbacks are required, the simplest place to cut back is in the market. I am sure <Col N="24" /> the Deputy will agree that we require a tourism marketing fund, but the problem is where that fund will come from. The strategy is that it would come from the EU, the Exchequer and the industry itself.</P>
      <P>With the modest levy we could set up a fund &ndash; the industry has agreed that we require a £20 million fund &ndash; over the next five years, rather than have an <i>ad hoc</i> system where one wonders what one will get year after year. The tourism marketing fund we have agreed to set up is what the industry needs in future. A small levy would be one way in which we could proceed, but no decision has yet been taken on that. I have been in discussions over the past six months with the industry. I have assured them that no decisions will be taken unless they are in agreement and that is where the matter rests at present.</P>

      <P>I agree 100 per cent with the Minister that we need to market Ireland and I have always said so. In my constituency we are well aware of the need for marketing. Does the Minister not agree, however, that the Government has a duty to shoulder a major proportion of the marketing budget, as the Exchequer is the main beneficiary from the billions of pounds we receive from tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course, I agree that the Exchequer benefits enormously from tourism but the Exchequer provides up to £30 million towards Bord Fáilte. Approximately £8 million of that goes towards the true marketing area. There will be a huge deficit, however, if EU funding dries up. Unlike any other sector, tourism must begin marketing a couple of years in advance. A fund is required to plan for the future. The Exchequer will not be found wanting in that area, if it comes to that.</P>
      <P>I still want to be able to set up this fund which will put the industry on a firm footing over the next five years. No decision has been taken on this matter yet, but at the end of the day the Exchequer and the Government will not be found wanting as regards funding.</P>

The Minister said that no final decision had been taken on deliberations concerning a possible small levy. He also mentioned the establishment of a fund of £15 million to £20 million. How much is being spent on marketing Ireland by the industry? I know about the floppy disc one can get for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister flying a kite? He has covered every conceivable aspect of this matter. Is this a deliberate policy by the Minister to introduce a minor levy, as he calls it, which would increase as time goes on? Will he clarify the position regarding this proposal &ndash; is it serious or is it dead in the water?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry has put approximately £1 million into destination marketing, which is the OTMI. However, as the Deputy knows from having been in this position previously, all those involved in the industry say they are doing individual marketing as well. They state that the figure they are putting in on an individual basis, whether it be Aer Lingus, other air carriers or ferries, is approximately between £40 million and £50 million.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that a marketing fund is necessary. The industry's research indicates that £20 million per year is required. The introduction of a small levy, as has been mentioned, is a way of putting the industry on a firm footing over the next five years. The matter has been discussed at length with the industry. It is not a kite. We could apply that type of idea.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that a similar levy applies in all European countries, with the exception of Italy and Switzerland which do not have to do any marketing. For example, in Austria the levy is £8 and in Belgium it is £10. In Denmark, where it was introduced last year, it is £7.80, in Finland £7.30, France £7, Germany £3, Greece £14, the Netherlands £3.20, Norway £12.20, Portugal £7.80, Spain £4, Sweden £10 and in the United Kingdom it is £10 sterling. The levy operates in nearly every country in Europe where it is put towards a marketing fund. I believe in the idea and think such a levy is needed here if we are to put the industry on a firm footing, but it will not stop us from seeking further EU funding. As I stated, no decision has yet been taken. A decision will only be taken when I have the full co-operation of the industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister has clarified two things: first, this is not a kite and, therefore, it is a distinct proposal by the Minister and his Department and, second, there are similar levies in other European countries. However, the very reason for our success in tourism is not our similarity to other European countries but our difference. Is the Minister not contradicting himself by saying that this is a distinct and definite proposal to the industry, while at the same time saying that if there is a shortfall the Exchequer will not be found wanting? Is the Minister not giving the industry a clear out by saying that he will cover whatever shortfall exists? Even if the industry rejects the proposal for a minor levy proposal, the Minister has already confirmed that the Exchequer will take up the slack.</P>

I have already pointed out that over the next four years, tourism will become the number one industry, worth £4.3 billion to the economy. We need to have a planning strategy in place so that we can plan for the next five years. Otherwise, we will go back to the usual system of getting a bit <Col N="26" /> from the Exchequer on a year by year basis. There is no future planning in that type of system.</P>

If Ireland is to maintain its current status, which has been built up by different Administrations in recent years, we must ensure a proper marketing fund is available. It is one idea and it does not prevent us seeking further EU funds. It will not be introduced unless the industry agrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>In June 1998 I launched details of Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme. The draft programme was circulated to all national governing bodies of sport recognised for the purposes of public funding, the Olympic Council of Ireland and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>The programme will be implemented under the auspices of the Irish sports council when the council is established on a statutory basis. As the Deputy may be aware, I presented the text of the Sports Council Bill in October 1998 and Second Stage was passed last week in the House.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed legislation, a specific function of the Irish sports council will be &ldquo;to take such action as it considers appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in sport&rdquo;. The proposed programme will comprise a three strand approach to the issue of doping in sport &ndash; education, research and testing.</P>
      <P>Testing under the programme is due to begin as soon as the statutory sports council is established. Work is already under way in my Department to advance various operational matters to facilitate immediate implementation of the programme by the new council, particularly the testing programme. Such matters include, for example, seeking tenders for the collection of samples, both in and out of competition, from athletes and for the provision of the necessary laboratory analysis services.</P>
      <P>In addition, the current sports council is asking all NGBs to ensure they have appropriate enabling mechanisms within their constitutions to facilitate the effective working of the programme, including adherence to any guidelines the new statutory council may issue in the context of the programme. Once the national sports anti-doping programme is operational, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, which we signed in June 1992.</P>
      <P>My Department would not have any information with regard to the level of testing of Irish athletes undertaken to date in 1999 by their national governing bodies, international federations or the Olympic movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the nauseating spectacle of adulation which was presented to Mr. Samaranch in Lausanne recently? Given the failure of the political process to impose its will in terms of the prevention of drug abuse and steroid taking, will the Minister <Col N="28" /> consider whether Irish athletes should go to Sydney in view of the unprecedented scale of drug taking which has encompassed athletics globally?</P>
      <P>Why do the IRFU and the Olympic Council of Ireland have their own dope testing procedures given that it has not been possible to implement the sports anti-doping programme? Has the Minister had any discussions with the Gaelic Athletic Association, given the build and nature of some of the teams which have emerged in the past ten years? Does the Minister consider there is drug taking within the confines of the last truly amateur game left on the planet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information regarding the Gaelic Athletic Association, the IRFU or the OCI. No programme has yet been established to do this type of testing. When the Sports Council Bill is passed and enforced, the first form of independent testing will be carried out. The IRFU and the OCI have their own testing regimes, but I do not agree with it because they are not independent. Under the new sports council, a special committee will be established. This will be independent of the sports council and other bodies. I do not agree with doctors investigating doctors or the Garda investigating the Garda. The type of agency which will be established will be totally independent of each of the national governing bodies. It will be then up to the governing bodies to bring forward what I hope will be uniform sanctions which will be imposed if athletes are caught taking drugs.</P>
      <P>It would be a sad day if Irish athletes did not go to Sydney. I agree with the Deputy that, unfortunately, we no longer own sport and it appears big business and multinationals have taken it over. However, I would not advocate that Irish athletes who have trained comprehensively and studiously over many long dark nights should not go to Sydney. Ireland will send a team to Sydney and I have no hesitation about Irish athletes participating in the games.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's comments about a nauseating spectacle. I assume the Deputy is referring to the fact that people were bowing to the President of the International Olympic Committee.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I will be the first Minister to introduce an anti-doping policy in Ireland. Up to now, organisations have not had an anti-doping policy and tests are not carried out in Ireland. I intended to have 600 tests carried out here before the end of 1999 and, after the results became available, I would have known the prevalence of dope taking by Irish athletes. However, unfortunately, the Sports Council Bill has not yet been passed by the House. Only the Second Stage is agreed to date.</P>
      <P>The role of the House is to pass legislation. Unfortunately, in the past number of weeks, it has been used as a theatre, a stage and a court of law. It would be nice if the House returned to the business for which we were all elected, the passing of legislation. If the Bill is passed, I will be in a position to answer the Deputy's questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Upton's question, I hope to carry out as many tests as possible as soon as the Bill is passed. I appreciate the co-operation I have received from Deputies on both sides of the House in getting the Bill to Committee Stage. I assure Deputy Upton that if he wishes to put down some worthy amendments, I will not be found wanting so we can proceed in passing the Bill. Two mobile units will traverse the country taking tests at any GAA ground, boxing arena, swimming pool or tennis club. I have planned for that as soon as the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Kenny's question, we have discussed that matter in the House. In certain schools and in certain sports, children have been exposed to medicinal substances, about which I <Col N="30" /> have a great deal of suspicion. Not enough research has been done in this area. Deputies have previously and rightly condemned the use of any substance about which they are concerned. Other than sending out that message from the House, we have also written to schools expressing our concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 70, 74, 82 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>On 13 October of last year, the Government agreed to the commissioning of a feasibility study for the development of a national stadium, and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct the feasibility study and to make recommendations based on the findings of the study.</P>
      <P>The steering committee is chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh and includes representatives from major sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Government Departments. Through this process, the major sporting organisations, including the FAI, will be in a position to bring their perspectives to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee will oversee the preparation of a feasibility study which will address the issues necessary for the Government to make an early <Col N="31" /> decision on the matter. The study will examine a range of issues relevant to the feasibility of developing and operating a stadium, the economic, social and other benefits that can be expected to be derived, and will analyse potential demand for use of the facilities from various sporting, entertainment and other commercial categories. Such analysis will clearly need to take cognisance of all existing and proposed stadia developments, such as the plans recently announced by the FAI for a stadium in west Dublin.</P>
    <P>A process to select experts to carry out the feasibility study is now under way, and a number of consultants have been invited to submit tenders for the task by a deadline of today, 9 February. The next meeting of the steering committee is scheduled for 22 February. It is expected that the finalised feasibility study and the steering committee's recommendations on it will be available for consideration by the Government by September 1999.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the FAI in presenting its proposals for its arena project has indicated that it intends putting in place arrangements to ensure that its proposed stadium will be self-financing and not reliant on external grant aid. No application for funding has been received from the FAI by my Department in respect of this project. The chief executive of the FAI has recently written to me to arrange to give me and Minister of State, Deputy Flood, a full presentation on the project and I look forward to meeting the association shortly in this regard. I am not aware of any recent proposals for a stadium in the Phoenix Park area, nor have I met any prospective developers in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent will the expert group interact with the major sporting organisations, for example, with the FAI as regards its new stadium plan and also with the GAA as regards Croke Park? The outcome of the report and its recommendations will be conditioned by the response the group receives from the major sporting bodies, for example, from the GAA as regards the use of Croke Park by a larger number of sporting bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>All the various sporting organisations are represented on the steering committee and we have already sent out tenders for a feasibility study to be carried out. This will determine the position of the FAI and the GAA as regards their stadia plans. We are interested in the outcome of the feasibility study which will determine if the development of a national stadium is possible. However, I am sure the FAI and the IRFU are as interested in the result of the feasibility study as we are. As the FAI has said it is going ahead with its stadium, it will be interested, perhaps more than any other body, in the results of the feasibility study.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that a number of national stadia have been proposed recently. We have waited for such developments for 20 or 30 years and other than the extension and modernisation of Croke Park, nothing has happened. The GAA has made its decision and has built the bulk of what it proposed to develop. The new Cusack stand has been built and the development of the canal end is in progress. This seems to isolate the GAA, which is unfortunate as Croke Park is inhibited by the lack of parking in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>I referred to Phoenix Park in my question but I was fishing in the dark to a degree. The racehorse owner and international currency dealer, J.P. McManus, announced some months ago that he was willing to put up a considerable amount of money, £10 million, £20 million or £30 million, towards the construction of a national stadium, which confused me a little. However, if he is prepared to do that and if he has others on board, that is fine. Is he part of the group of various sporting organisations to which the Minister referred?</P>
      <P>The FAI has proposed a new soccer stadium for Saggart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a great idea and has been welcomed by all soccer followers in the country. It should have been done years ago when we were on the crest of a wave. How will these four proposals &ndash; Croke Park, Mr. McManus' project, the FAI project and the Minister's grandiose scheme, which I welcome &ndash; be moulded together? Surely what we need is a large super stadium for every major sport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we require one major stadium for sport. However, I disagree with him as regards Croke Park. The Deputy will be aware that Croke Park is operational practically every week of the year, for Leinster matches, club finals, and womens' football which has undergone a recent upsurge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Waterford knows more about that. Other stadia have to be used for these matches. This country requires a national stadium. San Francisco has an approximate population of one to two million people and it has five stadia. One national stadium in addition to Croke Park would be the ideal solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards J.P. McManus, he is represented on the committee by a solicitor. As I said previously, the culture in this country tends to change slowly, sometimes too slowly. However, I hope the culture that gave rise to the likes of J. P. McManus never changes and that we will continue to have <Col N="33" /> people like him who are entrepreneurs and interested in sport and who are willing to put their money, as a gift to the nation, into sport.</P>
    <P>With regard to the FAI, I have welcomed its proposal for a stadium in west Dublin. It is long overdue. I believe it could have built a stadium some years ago. Now that the FAI has made its announcement and I have established a steering committee to examine the feasibility of a national stadium, we are both watching each other. However, I guarantee the Deputy that the feasibility study will go ahead. It will take into consideration the proposed FAI stadium and the possibility that that stadium might not come to fruition. The FAI will be as interested in the results of the feasibility study as I and other Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent will the location of the stadium be a factor in the considerations of the expert group? Is the proposal for a stadium or for a sports complex which includes shopping centres, hotels and the other facilities which are attached to these stadia in other countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>These are concepts for the future but I support the general principle. Is the Minister satisfied that the path he is adopting is clear in so far as he will not leave himself open to legal challenge from those who might believe they did not benefit from the application of due process to their proposals for the national stadium? Following the feasibility study, does the Minister hope to be in a position this year or next year to provide capital funding for the commencement of this project?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not undertake a feasibility study unless the Government was determined to take it on board. The political will is there. I am fortunate to have a Taoiseach and a Minister for Finance whose spiritual homes are in Croke Park and the Curragh as opposed to Croagh Patrick and Lough Derg. I am sure funding will be available. I am also quite comfortable with regard to the other issue mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The best available gauge of visitor perceptions of value for money in areas such as those specified by the Deputy is the biennial Bord <Col N="34" /> Fáilte visitor attitudes survey, the most recent of which was carried out in 1997. The results of that survey show that more than eight in ten overseas holiday makers who use top and medium grade hotels were very or fairly satisfied with price as were eight in ten who used other grade hotels; 97 per cent of overseas holiday makers who used high quality restaurants and more than nine out of ten who used budget restaurants were very or fairly satisfied with price and three out of four overseas holiday makers who rented or hired cars were very or fairly satisfied with price.</P>
      <P>In a comparison of prices generally, 89 per cent of overseas holiday makers considered prices in Ireland to be lower, about the same or higher but acceptable, compared to prices in their own country and 81 per cent considered prices in Ireland to be lower, about the same or higher but acceptable compared to prices in other holiday destinations which were believed to offer the same type of holiday as Ireland.</P>
      <P>While there can be no room for complacency and we must continue to strive for improvement, there is no doubt that these results are reassuring.</P>

      <P>While I agree with much of the Minister's reply, does he agree that the cost of car hire is a huge issue and is not value for money? Does he intend to introduce any measures to tackle this problem? The difficulty with the cost of car hire is attributable to the short season and the length of time cars are out on hire. Does the Minister further agree that the congestion of the roads out of Dublin, the lack of adequate air services to regional airports and an inadequate rail service mean that destinations outside Dublin are at a disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's last point. With regard to car hire, the situation has improved dramatically in recent years, particularly with the introduction of the special arrangements for VRT. That has improved matters by giving the car hire companies a cashflow, which they did not have previously. The increased number of tourists coming to this country and the extension of the season have also helped in keeping car hire prices down. These factors have also assisted in improving car hire services. Certainly, some people will claim that car hire is a problem but where car hire is included in package deals, it has improved dramatically.</P>

      <P>Since I took office I have indicated to Bord Fáilte on a number of occasions, as recently as this week in a letter, that it must vigorously pursue a policy of regionalisation. In other words, it should try to ensure that all regions of the country are treated equally and that there will be a regional spread outside Dublin. Bord Fáilte is pursuing this through the marketing areas we discussed earlier.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a problem with litter. On the streets of Dublin one can sometimes find oneself, within 50 metres of the pavement, in what can only be described as a human ashtray. Certainly, more could be done to tackle this problem.</P>

    <Title>Death of King Hussein of Jordan: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>King Hussein of Jordan was the Middle East's longest serving leader. During his 47 year reign, Jordan played a vital political role in the region, disproportionate to its size and wealth. This reflected Jordan's strategic geographical position, in the midst of some of the most influential countries in the Middle East, but it was also due in great measure to the wisdom, personal vision and tenacity of the King who, for many years, was a central figure in the quest for Arab-Israeli peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At his funeral yesterday, the huge gathering of world leaders was a testimony to the extent of King Hussein's influence on regional and world affairs. As one report put it yesterday, &ldquo;Kings, princes, presidents and even sworn enemies gathered together&rdquo; to bid farewell to this exceptional <Col N="37" /> man. President McAleese and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Michael Woods, represented Ireland at the formal ceremonies which demonstrated the great respect and affection in which the King was held in Ireland and throughout the world. Most importantly, this respect was shared by his own neighbours, both Arab and Israeli. The representation at the funeral was an acknowledgment of King Hussein's achievements in promoting the well-being of the people of Jordan and of neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>King Hussein worked tirelessly for over 40 years for peace in the Middle East. He negotiated for his people a landmark peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Just last October, he left his hospital bed to help advance the negotiations which ultimately led to the Wye River Memorandum between Israel and the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>President Clinton said that it takes a rare kind of courage to be a peacemaker &ndash; the courage to learn from the past and imagine a better future. He, more than anyone, knows what the late King Hussein contributed to the search for peace in the region. As President Clinton said, &ldquo;when peace finally comes to the Middle East, his name will be inscribed upon it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to the Middle East, I had the opportunity to see at first hand the situation in the region and to meet with some of the leaders who are working to shape a better future for their respective peoples. When I discussed the peace process with them, King Hussein's positive influence and contribution was stressed on many occasions.</P>
    <P>In my conversations with the leaders whom I met, I reaffirmed the commitment of the Irish Government to support and encourage all those seeking peace. I underlined our wish to see a resumption of the implementation by all sides of the Wye River Agreement. I find it particularly sad that King Hussein, having played an important role in bringing about the Wye Accord, has died without seeing its full implementation.</P>
    <P>It is through maintaining the momentum of the Wye River Agreement and working towards the full achievement of an acceptable and lasting solution to the situation in the Middle East that the best tribute could be paid to the memory of King Hussein. It is important that the example he set is followed by all the parties in the Middle East peace process.</P>
    <P>In February 1997, the King and Queen Noor paid a visit to Ireland. Those who met him found him to be perceptive and caring. King Hussein had many friends and well-wishers in Ireland and we are grateful for the contribution he made to the warm relations between our countries.</P>
    <P>He grew from boyhood to manhood as King and his country grew with him. After 47 not always easy years on the throne, King Hussein has left a void which will be very difficult to fill. Our thoughts are with the fourth Hashemite monarch in Jordan, King Abdullah. I trust his task will be made easier by the assistance of <Col N="38" /> Crown Prince Hamza. King Abdullah has promised to continue the work of his father in support of peace in the Middle East. We salute his commitment and wish him well.</P>
    <P>The Government extends its sincerest condolences to King Abdullah and to all the bereaved family of the late King Hussein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Taoiseach in expressing the sympathy of this House to the people of Jordan and to the family of His Majesty, King Hussein Bin Talal of Jordan. The King began his career as a leader of his people at a very early age and in the most difficult circumstances. He came to office in the midst of war and strife and, despite his youth, he succeeded in keeping his people together and maintaining the prosperity and the tolerant approach to international relations of his country.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity of meeting the late King Hussein on three occasions. I met him at the summit on terrorism in Sharm el Sheikh, at the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin of Israel and I received him as Taoiseach on his visit to Ireland. He struck me as somebody who was, in the real meaning of the term, a natural leader. He had a dignity that was inherent in his person and if there is such a thing as natural nobility &ndash; some would argue it does not exist &ndash;  clearly the King of Jordan had that quality.</P>
      <P>It is important not to underestimate the extent of King Hussein's achievements. He came to office at a time when he was leader of a Bedouin people with a Bedouin state. Suddenly, as a result of the creation of the state of Israel and the first war between Israel and its neighbours, the population content of the state he led changed dramatically. The Bedouin were no longer the sole inhabitants and there was a large number of refugees of Palestinian origin living in the state. These were two groups not naturally easy to assimilate and it is one of the great achievements of the King that he was able to assimilate two very different Arab peoples in one nation and win the loyalty equally, despite having to take some difficult measures, of all those in Jordan, both of Palestinian origin and of Jordanian and Bedouin origin. That achievement of unifying people of different traditional political beliefs shows him to be an example not just to other countries in the Arab world but to countries such as Ireland which is seeking, as part of our peace process, to reconcile different political traditions and allegiances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also to recognise the extreme difficulties under which King Hussein had to work, the huge economic dislocation his country had to endure and, as we know, economic dislocation always brings political difficulty for those seeking to rule. He was somebody who was able, by his person and through his ability as a leader, to keep his people together despite the hardships they had to endure as a result of the various wars, the most serious of which in recent times was the <Col N="39" /> Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the consequences which flowed from that.</P>
    <P>The King took an interest in the development of links between his country and Ireland. During his visit here he was very interested in the fact that a large number of Jordanian students are studying medicine and other subjects here. I know he personally took an interest in this and in the work of various Irish companies working in Jordan. Many people who have visited Jordan have been conscious of the welcome they received from the Jordanian people led by the King himself.</P>
    <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy to the people of Jordan and wishing the new King, and all those who are assisting him in his work, his government and others, success in their efforts to bring peace to that most troubled part of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I too would like to extend to the people of Jordan our sympathies to them on the death of King Hussein after a reign of 47 years. King Hussein provided extraordinary leadership at a time of great turbulence over that 47 year period and lived in the eye of the storm on more than one occasion. He brought to the people of Jordan a degree of stability that their neighbours did not enjoy and, as Deputy Bruton said, he managed to bring together two quite different Arab peoples in a manner that can be celebrated in the country of Jordan.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that the King was a personal friend of this country. He had developed personal links through his interest in ham radio and he was aware of the many Jordanian students studying here. He was also a good advocate of closer Irish-Jordanian business links.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish his successor, King Abdullah, his son, success in what will be a difficult and trying period. I hope that during the course of this King's reign, Jordan will move towards a constitutional monarchy where the values of democracy will prevail. We have to make the observation that democracy is synonymous with economic prosperity and, in the main, democratic states which live side by side with each other do not have a propensity to declare war upon each other. The best prospect for economic prosperity and political peace in the Middle East is for the Arab nations, including Jordan, to join with the state of Israel, for all of its internal difficulties, and become democratic constitutional monarchies which will hopefully lead to peace and stability in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party, I join the other party leaders in paying tribute to the late King Hussein of Jordan. Anyone who watched his burial in Amman could not have failed to note the high esteem in which he was held as a man and a mon<Col N="40" /> arch by the diversity of political leaders who attended. He will be mourned not only by his family, but by people throughout the whole world who have an interest in the stability of the Middle East.</P>
      <P>King Hussein sadly failed in his battle against cancer, but succeeded in so many other ways. His principal concern was to protect his people, even when that meant taking decisions with which his neighbours and others fundamentally disagreed. A military man, he saw it as his duty to fight for his country and to make peace when that seemed to be the rational path to take.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, he visited Ireland with his wife two years ago. There was, of course, a political context to his visit, but there was also a family context because his daughter was training to be an Olympic showjumper in a stud in Meath. She accompanied him on many of his official visits.</P>
      <P>He was a peacemaker and a statesman, and he worked ceaselessly for Arab-Israeli peace. He acceded to the throne as a teenager and spent his life in the cause of peace in the region.</P>
      <P>I wish his successor all the best in continuing the method and manner of his father's leadership and statesman-like behaviour in the world of international affairs.</P>

      <P>The most lasting tribute which was paid to the late King of Jordan at his funeral was the extent to which so many of the mourners who regard each other as enemies were able to stand side by side and show their respect for his memory and appreciation for his life. The Green Party pays tribute to his work for peace and acknowledges his courage in fighting the cancer which in the end caused him to pass on. We wish his successor well and peace and prosperity to his country. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The merciless killing of the late Garda Jerry McCabe and the attack on his colleague, Garda Ben O'Sullivan, was an outrage. It was widely condemned at the time by all right-thinking people. I do not believe any of us will forget the shock we felt at hearing of those dreadful events at Adare. While the response to the use of weapons of death in pursuit of any criminal escapade can never be other than outrage and condemnation, there is no doubt that when the <Col N="48" /> weapons are directed at those whose duty and calling it is in our democracy to enforce the law, the crime takes on a level of gravity which distinguishes and marks it apart in the public mind. Then we are faced not only with the savagery and inhumanity which the commission of any such act entails, but also with the widespread sense and reality that the authority of the State has been attacked.</P>
      <P>It is right and understandable that the sense of outrage we shared then has not diminished with the passage of time, and the proof of that continuing outrage is the widespread concern about what transpired in the Special Criminal Court last week. It is right too that this House should take the first appropriate opportunity to discuss this matter and I am grateful to the Whips and Opposition spokespersons for their co-operation in arranging this debate.</P>
      <P>All Members will be fully aware that under the Constitution the courts are independent in the performance of their functions. The same applies, under the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Prior to that, the DPP's functions were performed by successive Attorneys General. Although it is widely accepted that successive Attorneys, who were appointed on the nomination of the Taoiseach of the day, performed their prosecutorial functions independently, without fear or favour, it was felt in 1974 that the time had come to reinforce the perception of independence through the devolution of this function to an independent Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Introducing the Bill, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, the late Professor John Kelly, stated that one of its primary aims was &ldquo;to ensure, as will be generally agreed to be desirable, that our system for the prosecution of offences should not only be impartial but should be seen to be so, and that it should not only be free from outside influence but should be manifestly so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He further stated it should also remove any grounds for thinking that political considerations influence the Attorney General in carrying out his function as regards criminal prosecutions and that the &ldquo;Government's objective of a clearly impartial system for the prosecution of criminal offences will be achieved by the provision, expressly written into the Bill . . . that the Director of Public Prosecutions is to be independent in the exercise of his functions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will know also that my predecessors in office from different political parties have repeatedly made clear in this House that they were not involved in Garda operational matters, most particularly not in making decisions in relations to Garda investigations of crime, nor did they have a role in decisions about the handling of criminal trials. I am in the same position as they were, and I have respected and will continue to respect the separate role of the Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime and of the DPP in prosecuting crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> The independence of all the agencies at issue in the matters I have set out is not a convenient cloak, it is fundamental to the manner in which the rule of law and our system of Government operate. In these circumstances the House will appreciate it follows that we have no function in seeking to go behind the decisions made in particular cases; nor, as Minister, would I be in a position to account for the decisions taken by these agencies in a particular case. I am not privy to the detailed discussions among the legal teams handling cases, nor should I be.</P>
    <P>Clearly, however, in any democracy the matter does not simply rest there. The House is entitled, consistent with the respective roles of the various agencies I have outlined and in light of my responsibilities as Minister, to hear as full an account as I am in a position to provide in relation to matters which have given rise to public concern. This is particularly so in the context that we as a Legislature have an obligation, as do I as Minister, to address as best we can public concern about particular issues, and make an assessment as to what, if any, action might be open to us on these matters.</P>
    <P>Before giving the House an account of the events as known to me, I want to make two points abundantly clear. The first relates to public comment on the question of political involvement in the decision made by the DPP. Neither I nor any official of my Department sought to interfere in any way in the DPP's decision making process in this case. I believe my predecessors would be as appalled as I am by any such suggestion. Deputies on all sides of the House would condemn such interference were it to take place and they would be right to do so.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the file on the Adare case remains open. There has been public comment to the effect that other suspects who may have been involved in this crime are at large at present. I can confirm for the House that the gardaí believe a small number of people could help them with their inquiries. I sincerely request Deputies to accept we are all equally anxious to have all those whom the gardaí wish to interview in connection with the Adare crime made available for interview. However, I am sure and am advised that this outcome would not be assisted in any way by the naming of names, nor if we were to speculate here or elsewhere about the likelihood of adopting particular legal strategies to have the persons concerned brought back to this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The broad facts surrounding what happened in the Special Criminal Court during the course of the trial in question are largely a matter of public record. The trial began on 12 January 1999. During its course it became obvious that the prosecution would not be able to rely, in the case of some witnesses, on the evidence which had been given earlier in statements to the Garda. Two of those witnesses &ndash; who were immediate relatives of one of the accused &ndash; would not testify in line with <Col N="50" /> what they said in the statement which they made to the Garda and at the request of the prosecution were deemed to be hostile witnesses. A third witness, who had previously stated that the raiders had returned to his house after the robbery, simply refused to testify in the trial at all and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. I shall return to why the witnesses in question failed to testify, but these essential facts set out the background against which a plea bargain was entered into in this case. I make it clear in this context that I am using the term &ldquo;plea-bargaining&rdquo; for the sake of convenience. However, it should not be taken from my use of this term that there was any judicial involvement in the process which might be the case in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to give the House some background on the practice of plea-bargaining in this jurisdiction. The Law Reform Commission in its Consultation Paper on Sentencing sets out the law generally on plea-bargaining. It pointed out that in the vast majority of cases in Ireland sentence is imposed subsequent to a plea of guilty by the defendant to at least some charges. It points out that practitioners suggested to it that very many of these pleas are the result of negotiations with the prosecution &ndash; what is generally known as &ldquo;plea-bargaining&rdquo;. While it is the case that very many of these would arise in the context of relatively minor cases, the commission, in setting out a list of what it refers to as the practical benefits of plea-bargaining, mentions &ldquo;The result is certain and may be preferable to the possibility of the accused person being acquitted of a number of charges or of a more serious charge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Essentially what was at issue in the case we are debating here today was that the Director of Public Prosecutions, in consultation with the legal team conducting the prosecution in court, had to make a judgment in the light of facts and circumstances which began to unfold as the trial proceeded. The consequences of these circumstances, the general nature of which I outlined, were put on the record of the Special Criminal Court by Mr. Edward Comyn, S.C. who the House will be aware is one of the most experienced criminal trial lawyers in this State. Against this background, discussions took place between the legal teams for the prosecution and the defence during which the defence indicated that the accused would plead guilty to manslaughter on the understanding that the murder charge would not be proceeded with. It was obviously the prosecutors' professional judgment that, in all the circumstances, the right course was to opt for the certainty of a conviction, rather than run what was judged to be the unacceptable risk, if the murder charge were insisted upon, that the killers would walk free.</P>
    <P>Because of his statutory independence in such matters, it is not a matter for me to account for or defend the decision which was ultimately reached by the Director of Public Prosecutions in this case. However, in saying that, I believe all <Col N="51" /> Members of this House will accept that this would have been one of the most difficult and sensitive decisions which the Director of Public Prosecutions has ever been called upon to make. While it is a matter of regret and deep disappointment that the highly experienced prosecution team found themselves in a situation where, on the basis of their own professional analysis, an insistence on holding to the murder charge carried an unacceptably high risk of failure, we should all acknowledge, in fairness to everyone concerned, that the deciding factor was professional judgment, honestly reached, and not any extraneous consideration. It is the case that the senior gardaí involved in the case were kept fully abreast of what was judged by the lawyers to be the appropriate course before the decision to accept the plea was made. They were as disappointed as everybody else at the way the case was turning out, but they too had to follow the advice they received.</P>

      <P>For the sake of balance too, it might be worthwhile to reflect on what the reaction might have been if a different decision had been taken, the trial proceeded to an acquittal, those who had committed the killing subsequently walked free and it subsequently became known that the director had rejected a plea of guilty to manslaughter. We have to ask ourselves honestly if the public concern or criticism would have been any the lesser had events taken that course instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the issue of witnesses being unwilling to give evidence in court on the lines of statements which they had made to the Garda. In common with police forces around the world, the Garda Síochána have procedures in place to afford protection in whatever form is appropriate <Col N="52" /> to persons who are prepared to give evidence in open court in criminal trials. The level of that protection is obviously for operational decision in the light of an assessment of all the circumstances of a particular case. As a general point, I am sure members will accept that protection, however, is not something that can be imposed on witnesses against their will.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific case we are discussing, I can inform the House that the question of protection of witnesses was an issue. I am advised by the Garda authorities that &ldquo;what the witnesses accepted was the maximum in terms of security arrangements they could be prevailed upon to accept&rdquo;. I am also advised by the Garda authorities that &ldquo;it would not be in the interest of future prosecutions to disclose information about the detailed security arrangements made&rdquo;. I have noted and fully understand concerns expressed to the effect that witnesses may have been intimidated in this case. It must be borne in mind that witnesses can have many reasons for ultimately refusing to give evidence that do not necessarily relate to intimidation, for example, because, for whatever reason, they do not wish to see a particular accused person convicted or punished for a crime. We have to acknowledge too that because of the very nature of intimidation its existence will not always become known to gardaí and certain witnesses will feel intimidated, irrespective of whether there is any overt threat. In any case the House will welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner yesterday appointed a superintendent to investigate the issue of possible witness intimidation in this case.</P>
    <P>I have legislative proposals on witness protection matters with which we will deal later but, before doing so, I will deal with one further issue relating to the specific events we are considering. I refer to speculation on the question of early release for those who have been convicted of the killing of Garda McCabe. I wonder how many different ways we have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; for people to get the message that those involved will not have the benefit of the early release terms contained in the British-Irish Agreement. There has been clarity from the outset &ndash; from the time the British-Irish Agreement was negotiated &ndash; about this and the position has been made clear by the Taoiseach and me on numerous occasions. That there will now be manslaughter rather than murder convictions does not alter the Government's stance on this issue.</P>
    <P>There has been some speculation about a legal case being taken on the basis that the people involved have a legal entitlement to be released under the British-Irish Agreement. I assure the House that any such action will be vigorously resisted by the State. I consulted the Attorney General about this matter and he assures me that after the British-Irish Agreement the position in law remains that releases continue to be a matter for decision by the Government under the Offences against the State Act, 1939, and the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice <Col N="53" /> Act, 1960. It is the case that the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998, which was enacted in the context of the British-Irish Agreement, establishes a Release of Prisoners Commission but its role is solely advisory. Moreover, the commission can only consider cases of persons specified by the Minister to be &ldquo;qualifying prisoners&rdquo; and I do not regard the persons involved as falling into that category so the question of referring their cases to the commission will not arise.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring forward three new legislative proposals to deal with witness intimidation. The issue of witness intimidation has been one to which I have devoted particular attention as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The House will be aware that I introduced and provided funding for the recently established special witness security programme in high-profile cases. In addition, my Department has been working for some time on the question of whether improvements in the law could be made in this area. In the light of the work we have undertaken and in light of the understandable public concern about this issue, I can announce today that we propose to bring forward, in the near future, in the context of amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill which is before the House, important new legal provisions in the area of witness protection.</P>
    <P>First, we will allow witnesses who may be the subject of intimidation to give evidence by video-link. Second, we will make it an offence for people to try to trace witnesses who have been relocated as part of the witness protection programme. Third, while it is a common law offence at present to seek to intimidate witnesses in the context of contempt of court, we will be bringing forward a new statutory offence specifically targeted at intimidation of witnesses, with a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment. The House will accept these are sensible changes in our criminal law and they will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that during my contribution I have been able to address, within the context I outlined, issues which have been raised, particularly and understandably, by Members of the House about this case. The outcome of the case may not have been the one any of us would have wished for, but that was something beyond the control of everybody in the House. It is the case that the Garda successfully apprehended persons who were guilty of the outrage at Adare and on that they are to be congratulated. I am sure everyone on all sides of the House will agree with me in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members will also agree that it would be wrong to let this occasion pass without placing on the record of the House the admiration we all share for the dignity and fortitude with which Detective Garda McCabe's family have borne their dreadful loss. I wish to offer on behalf of all Members our full support to the family in their <Col N="54" /> difficult journey of coming to terms with their great and sad loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputy Jim Higgins who will be the main questioner on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>As Taoiseach in June 1996, I had the very unhappy duty to meet Ann McCabe and her five children to sympathise with them on their tragic loss. Their husband and father was taken from them by a group of men, every one of whom was a member of the IRA and reportedly also members of Sinn Féin. That party failed to condemn this murder at the time. Initially, both Sinn Féin and the IRA denied any involvement in the murder. Journalists were briefed to the effect that it was not an IRA operation and that the perpetrators were not IRA members. However, the people who made those claims are now pleading for the early release of those convicted of this offence on the basis that they are members of the IRA, an organisation which, to use the words of Mr. Gerry Adams, is &ldquo;on cessation&rdquo;. That position is entirely inconsistent and there is no basis for it. Either these people were or were not members of the IRA when the offence was committed. If they were members then the statements issued by Sinn Féin at the time were false. If they were not members then the current statements being made by Sinn Féin are false.</P>
      <P>The huge efforts being made by senior members of Sinn Féin to have these men considered as eligible for early release suggest that the links between Sinn Féin and the IRA are deep and strong. Weekend reports strengthen this view. As I said in this House last year, at the top level the direction of the two organisations is identical in philosophy, purpose and execution &ndash; they are one and the same. They are two organisations in one movement, with one purpose, one strategy and one direction.</P>
      <P>Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was murdered. Legalistic semantics do not alter that fact. He was murdered by a heavily armed gang in the most brutal and callous circumstances, when 15 shots were fired into his car. It is an insult to a brave and dedicated officer and his colleagues, who continue to stand in the front line in preserving the safety of our State, to say that this act was anything but murder. It was a calculated assault on one of the most esteemed symbols of our democracy, the badge of the Garda Síochána, by the military wing of a political party which is represented in this House and which aspires to sharing power in the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Less than 12 months ago, we know that members of Sinn Féin lobbied the Taoiseach, Ministers and senior Government officials to have those convicted of this murder released early from prison. Before, during and since the court case from which the convictions resulted, there has been a constant chorus from senior members of Sinn Féin seeking to have these people released early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> In his contribution the Minister asked, &ldquo;I wonder how many different ways we have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; for people to get the message that those involved will not have the benefit of the early release terms contained in the British-Irish Agreement.&rdquo;  He went on to state: &ldquo;There has been clarity from the outset &ndash; from the time the British-Irish Agreement was negotiated &ndash; about this and the position has been made clear by the Taoiseach and me on numerous occasions.&rdquo;  Bearing that in mind, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that on Radio Kerry this morning the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, made alarming comments about the Taoiseach's remarks during the final hours of negotiating the British-Irish Agreement. Mr. Adams said that when he raised with the Taoiseach the issue of early release, the Taoiseach told him only that &ldquo;it would be very difficult&rdquo; or words to that effect and that &ldquo;the Taoiseach didn't rule this out completely&rdquo;. That is an alarming claim and it must be dealt with immediately. It directly contradicts the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's claim that there has been clarity from the outset. Mr. Adams's statement must be dealt with head-on.</P>
    <P>These comments are very much at variance with his stance on this subject in recent days. The Taoiseach must stand firm and deal fully with Mr. Adams's account of their meeting in Belfast last Easter, about which these alarming claims are being made. He must also inform the House of the nature of the comments he made to Mr. Adams so that the latter's statement on Radio Kerry can be contradicted forthwith. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must give watertight assurances that under no circumstances will these men be released early.</P>
    <P>Given the well known ability of the IRA to hold entire communities in Nationalist areas of Northern Ireland under their particularly vicious form of &ldquo;policing&rdquo;, it was surely entirely predictable that intimidation of witnesses would be a feature of this case. The failure of the Minister and the Garda to protect witnesses was a serious flaw in the prosecution of this case and the Minister did not deal satisfactorily with that. One witness said in court, &ldquo;I just want to know why should I be intimidated and threatened before I came to court.&rdquo;  This is a question which deserves to be answered by the Minister. However, he did not answer it. He informed us that he has only now appointed a superintendent to investigate witness intimidation in this case. That is an example of slamming the door when the horse has bolted. It is too late to investigate the matter now. The question of witness intimidation should have been dealt with before the case opened because it was obvious, knowing the IRA's record in respect of intimidating communities in Northern Ireland, that witness intimidation would be a feature of this case.</P>
    <P>The Kalashnikov rifle used to kill Jerry <Col N="56" /> McCabe has never been found. The same weapon was also fired at gardaí during an armed robbery in Kilmallock in 1994. Presumably this part of the IRA's armoury has now been cleaned, greased, wrapped and hidden. It is still, however, in commission and can be taken out of hiding for use when required. It is a small but deadly part of the arsenal of IRA weapons lying all over this island which the IRA refuse to decommission. I was recently informed by a senior Sinn Féin figure in this House that the IRA has said that it will never decommission and that he believes it will never do so. That statement was made by a signatory of the British-Irish Agreement in this House during the past week.</P>
    <P>There will be a contradiction at the heart of the peace process as long as that remains the position of the republican movement. The peace process initiated by Mr. Adams would have had an internal logic if there were no IRA statements to the effect that it would never decommission. Now that the IRA has again confirmed that it will never decommission, there is a fundamental contradiction to be addressed. How could Sinn Féin representatives sign an agreement which contains a commitment to work for decommissioning if they knew and believed that their associates in the IRA would &ldquo;never decommission&rdquo;? There was a fundamental insincerity in their signing the Agreement if that is the point of view of the organisation they represent.</P>
    <P>There is no point beating around the bush or making politically correct suggestions in the House that this matter should not be raised because it might upset people. I was criticised for telling the truth in this House at the time of the Omagh bombing. I asked a number of hard questions and everyone outside the House stated that I had chosen the wrong time and the wrong place. It is never the wrong time or place to tell the truth. The truth is that the IRA is determined never to decommission and that, unfortunately, Sinn Féin's signature on an agreement which commits its movement to decommissioning is insincere as long as it believes, as was said to me in this House, that to be the position of the IRA. That needs to be said in this House and we need to have the courage to say it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the soft words that are fashionable in some quarters in dealing with the republican movement are good for dialogue with it. This organisation has supported the use of violence in the past, understands plain talk and strong will. There is an obligation on Members of this House who believe that the IRA should decommission and that the mandate of the Irish people for the British-Irish Agreement is a mandate, among other things, for decommissioning, to speak plainly and show strong will in their dealings with Sinn Féin, the republican movement and the IRA in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister must deal comprehensively with the alarming claim made this morning on Radio Kerry by Mr. Adams when he sought to represent what the Taoiseach had said in Belfast. I do not <Col N="57" /> believe Mr. Adams was telling the truth; I believe the Taoiseach was telling the truth. However, Mr. Adams is effectively calling the Taoiseach a liar in saying he was ambiguous in his answers to questions about this matter. The Taoiseach must come into this House and deal directly with these alarming statements by Mr. Adams.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The decision by the State to accept a reduced plea of manslaughter in what was manifestly a murder, a capital murder at that, was wrong. It represents an unacceptable compromise and strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system. This was a case where there was a clear challenge to the authority and institutions of the State and the State lost. Seldom, if ever, has an outcome to a court case been greeted with such disquiet and universal public revulsion.</P>
      <P>On 7 June 1996 Detective Garda McCabe and Detective Garda O'Sullivan were escorting a postal van with £81,000 in cash. It was a well planned robbery. The Mitsubishi Pajero jeep rammed their car from behind. Two men in balaclavas approached the car in which the gardaí were sitting and, at point blank range, shot dead Garda McCabe and seriously injured Garda O'Sullivan. Ballistic experts confirmed that the bullets were fired from an AK-47, the standard weapon of the Provisional IRA. Four men were charged with capital murder.</P>
      <P>For 16 days the State ran a murder trial. On day 16, as a result of negotiations between lawyers for the State and lawyers for the defence, the State agreed to accept the reduced pleas of manslaughter. It was a wrong decision. From a situation of total denial of their involvement in the killing of Garda McCabe the four accused changed their plea. Essentially they said they were at the scene, had guns and killed Garda McCabe but did not mean it.</P>
      <P>If ever there was a case of cold blooded murder this was it. It was a planned, fully fledged Provisional IRA raid. Balaclavas and Kalashnikovs were used and a barrage of gunfire was fired into the body of a garda, not in self defence but with the intention of killing him and anybody else who got in their way. The intent was clear and how any State prosecution doubted its ability to prove it is beyond me. The net result is that instead of a mandatory sentence of 40 years the killers of Garda McCabe will now be back on the streets within eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, if Sinn Féin decides to use the release of the four men as a bargaining ploy in the peace process &ndash; it is its stated intention to have them walk free within two years &ndash; the people of Ireland are entitled to know what happened behind the scenes. What was put to the State in terms of substance that made it doubt the validity of its case? Why was there a dramatic change of approach by the State? Why did the State settle for a much lesser charge? Who initiated the negotiations? When did the Minister become aware of what was going on? Did he discuss the change of tactics by the State with the Taoiseach? There <Col N="58" /> was little forensic, but strong circumstantial evidence. Why were the judges not allowed to draw their own conclusions and inferences from the book of evidence as presented, from the strong circumstantial evidence and from the clear evidence of blatant intimidation?</P>
    <P>The State should have vigorously pressed the capital murder charge and it would not have risked all being lost. Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, states: &ldquo;Manslaughter is available as an alternative verdict&rdquo;. The section goes on to provide that where a person is accused of capital murder, or what is now properly called murder contrary to section 3 of the Act of 1990, if the evidence does not support the conviction for capital murder then a verdict of murder might be brought on. It goes on to provide that if the evidence does not support a conviction of murder but warrants a conviction for manslaughter the person can be found guilty of manslaughter. There was no need for the State to hoist the white flag, as happened in this case.</P>
    <P>The compromise of accepting a manslaughter charge sends out all of the wrong signals. It is a clear indication that intimidation rules and it compromises the safety of the gardaí by effectively stripping them of the protection and deterrent of a capital murder conviction. It underlines the manner in which intimidation can compromise the principles of democracy. It undermines the judicial system and subverts law and order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has seriously misread the mood of the public with regard to the extraordinary situation which led the DPP to accept pleas of guilty to manslaughter charges from those who had been charged with the murder of Detective Garda McCabe. Apart from the sense of sympathy and concern for the family of Jerry McCabe there is also a sense of anger and frustration among the public at what it sees as a serious failure in our legal system. The law may well have taken its course but justice has not been done. The public finds it impossible to reconcile the acceptance by the State of a guilty plea to charges of manslaughter with the graphic account of the violent death of Detective McCabe given to the Special Criminal Court a few weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To all of us the term &ldquo;manslaughter&rdquo; means causing the unintentional death of somebody, perhaps through carelessness or omission. How does this compare with the events of Adare on the morning of 7 June 1996? We know from evidence given to the court that Garda McCabe and Garda O'Sullivan were detectives from Limerick doing a routine job escorting a post office van delivering cash to various centres in Limerick. We know that when the van and its escort stopped in Adare at 6.50 a.m. their car was rammed by a jeep, that a number of men wearing balaclavas emerged from the jeep and that one of them without warning discharged 15 bullets through an automatic rifle into the confined space of a Garda vehicle. We know that the two detectives had no opportunity to draw their own weapons, that <Col N="59" /> Detective McCabe died instantly in that hail of bullets and that the men fled the scene leaving Detective McCabe dead and Detective O'Sullivan seriously injured. By any standards what happened in Adare was premeditated brutal murder and the inability of the State to secure a single conviction for murder is a serious failure of our legal system.</P>
    <P>Over recent days the Government has been placing great emphasis on the separation of the political and prosecutorial system. I doubt if anybody in this House would question the principle of that separation, nor do I have any reason to disbelieve that the DPP took the decision to accept pleas to reduce charges on his own initiative and that it was a bona fide decision of what he believed was the best course of action to take. I also accept that the Government has no responsibility for the decisions that the DPP must take with regard to any case. However, the Government has a responsibility to address public issues arising from the growing practice of plea bargaining. The Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have an absolute responsibility to ensure that witnesses are free from intimidation and that no evidence which should be available to a court is withheld from it because of acts or threats of intimidation. The Government has failed utterly in this regard. It is clear that intimidation of witnesses played a major role in the events which led to the State accepting reduced charges in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when in Opposition, chanted a mantra of zero tolerance. It is time he showed zero tolerance to intimidation. Our legal and judicial system can only operate if those who are called upon to give evidence in the courts can testify honestly, openly and truthfully without fear of intimidation for themselves, their associates and their families. For all his talk of zero tolerance, the Minister can no longer give that guarantee to the public.</P>
    <P>We know from evidence given to the court that three witnesses failed to stand over detailed statements they had given earlier to the gardaí and which were of vital importance to the State's case. We know that one witness who gave evidence, and who must be commended for his courage and civic spirit, said at the end of this testimony that he had been subject to intimidation. According to newspaper reports, gardaí are satisfied that six witnesses were victims of intimidation and that one had been threatened that his house would be burned if he gave evidence in this case. The lessons those charged with serious offences in the future will draw from this case is that intimidation pays.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government allow a situation to develop where those who had crucial evidence to give in a case of capital murder, the most serious charge which can be laid, were left to the mercy of thuggish elements whose commitment is to intimidation and not to justice? What is being done to bring those responsible for the intimi<Col N="60" /> dation in this case to justice? What steps are being taken to ensure that this pattern of intimidation does not recur? </P>
    <P>This case also raises serious questions about Sinn Féin's claims of commitment to the democratic process. We know there were members of Sinn Féin among the accused and that some of them who failed to back up the statements they gave to the gardaí with evidence were members of Sinn Féin. I have yet to hear any representative of Sinn Féin condemn outright the murder of Detective Garda McCabe in the straightforward way that is required of every citizen. We all remember with a cold sweat the weasel words of Mr. Pat Doherty on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; in June 1996 when he ducked, weaved and dodged every invitation to forthrightly condemn this murder. I have yet to hear any word of condemnation from Sinn Féin of the intimidation of witnesses.</P>
    <P>One of those convicted of serious offences arising from the events in Adare was the beneficiary of the early release programme introduced by the previous Government in the aftermath of the first Provisional IRA ceasefire. Is this the way the republican movement will repay the vote of trust this society places in it by releasing its prisoners early? </P>
    <P>The latest suggestion from Sinn Féin leaders that they may resort to the courts to try to support their contention that those responsible for the murder of Detective Garda McCabe are entitled to avail of the terms of the British-Irish Agreement for early release from their already lenient sentences is another example of hypocrisy from the republican movement. They are prepared to resort to the courts of this jurisdiction when it suits them, yet those associated with the republican movement are willing to resort to the vile practice of threats and intimidation to pervert the course of justice and to prevent members of their organisation from being held to account in the way that the vast majority of the citizens want and expect.</P>
    <P>I advise Sinn Féin of the real danger that the genuine goodwill it has enjoyed in the State for the constructive role it has played in the negotiation of the British-Irish Agreement is now in danger of being washed away by a tide of revulsion caused not just by the attitude of the republican movement to the murder of Detective Garda McCabe and the subsequent trial, but also to the continued daily accounts of punishment mutilations in Northern Ireland and the refusal to make any movement on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statements by a number of Ministers, including the Taoiseach which was re-echoed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform today, that those convicted in this case will not benefit from the early release provisions of the British-Irish Agreement. Public opinion would not tolerate such an early release. I listened with alarm to the words quoted by Deputy John Bruton of the President of Sinn Féin on Radio Kerry today, if they are true. It is important that there is an unequivocal statement <Col N="61" /> that it is not only the political will of this Government but the clear legal advice of the Attorney General, which should be published, that those responsible for this vile act are not legally entitled to qualify under any early release programme.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the claims made that some of those arrested in connection with this case may have been ill-treated while in Garda custody. I note that the Special Criminal Court in giving its judgment last Friday dismissed in absolute and unequivocal terms the claims that there had been ill-treatment of one of the accused, Mr. John Quinn. It stated that the judges were satisfied that Mr. Quinn had been treated in accordance with the law and with the utmost professionalism.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at procedures for monitoring interviews of persons in Garda stations which would not only protect accused persons but ensure that members of the Garda Síochána are not subject to spurious accusations of abuse. The most effective way to provide this protection is through the videoing or audio taping of interviews. As far back as 1984 the Criminal Justice Act provided for the electronic recording of interviews. Yet 15 years later, only a handful of Garda stations are equipped to do so. Whatever about the technical difficulties in providing video recording facilities in Garda stations, there is no reason audio taping should not be provided in every Garda station as is standard practice in British police stations.</P>
    <P>In light of this case, there is also a need to look again at the convention that the DPP does not give any public explanation for decisions he takes either in regard to accepting reduced charges or the reasons for failing to prosecute in a particular case. I understand the reluctance of the DPP and the fear that he might be asked to comment on the reasons behind his action in virtually every case. However, there are clearly understood special exceptional circumstances, especially in cases of major public importance where the public interest would be served by the DPP setting out briefly the reasons particular decisions were made. The Attorney General should seek to exercise the power available to him under section 2 (6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions over the general practice of plea bargaining and on what steps may need to be taken to ensure the prosecutions do not fail because of the intimidation of witnesses. It would be interesting to hear and I will certainly be posing it by way of question to the  Minister.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this case represented a set-back for our democratic and legal systems. I could not summarise the situation better than to quote from the statement issued by the Association of Garda Chief Superintendents, the representative body for the most senior Garda officers in this State &ndash; a responsible and cautious organisation, not given to flights of fancy, yet who were forced to conclude yesterday:</P>
    <P>This association believes that the murder of Detective Garda McCabe was a deliberate act <Col N="62" /> committed by ruthless, practised and dedicated terrorists. The sentence imposed on those individuals does not reflect the seriousness of the crime committed, nor does it serve as a warning to those who might follow their example. What occurred in Adare was an attack on one of the institutions of the State, the Garda Síochána, by the private army raised and maintained by the republican movement. What occurred in the Special Criminal Court last week was the same people taking on the criminal justice system of the State. They won on both occasions.</P>

        <b>:</b> During the Order of Business the Taoiseach undertook that during the course of this debate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would provide the gist of the advice from the Attorney General. What was the general advice to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform from the Attorney General? What is the Minister's reaction to the assertion by the President of Sinn Féin on Radio Kerry this morning that it would be difficult but the Taoiseach did not rule this out completely? Is he worried that two of the key players who on behalf of Sinn Féin negotiated and signed the British-Irish Agreement are openly challenging the assertion of the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government by their declared intention to have these people released under the terms of the British-Irish Agreement? What legal safeguard has the Minister to ensure this will not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice of the Attorney General is as I outlined in my original statement to this House, the powers of release are clearly contained in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, whereby the Government has the power of early release, and are also contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, under which the Minister for Justice of the day has the power of early release. It is true that following upon the signing of the British-Irish Agreement there was subsequent legislation dealing with the setting up of a commission on the release of prisoners but that legislation specifies quite clearly that the question of the commission advising on the release of prisoners is precisely that, an advisory role, they do not have the power to direct the Minister of the day to release a prisoner. In tandem with that it is for the Minister of the day to refer prisoners to the commission for their advice, which he may or may not accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear in those circumstances that this Minister and subsequent Ministers will not put before the commission the names of those convicted of the killing of Detective Garda McCabe. That is the position. Deputy Jim Higgins referred to the statements made by Sinn Féin leaders and it has been made clear on numerous occasions by the Taoiseach, by myself and by members of the Government that the people who were involved in killing Detective Garda McCabe will not qual<Col N="63" /> ify under the terms of the British-Irish Agreement. On 21 April 1998 when discussing the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill I stated, as reported in volume 489, column 1080 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>While emphasising that I will not speculate about the implications of the Agreement for individual cases, it is right that I should comment on one case, that is the case of those facing charges arising from the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe which has been the subject of certain recent media speculation. While obviously it would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on any case pending before the courts, the Government has made clear in its contact with all groups its views that persons who may be convicted in connection with this murder will not come within the ambit of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>I cannot put it any further than that. I have given the assurance on numerous occasions and so has the Taoiseach. This matter was raised during the negotiations which led to the British-Irish Agreement and it was made clear by officials from my Department that those who were convicted of that atrocity would not qualify under the early release provisions of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister comment on Mr. Gerry Adams's statement regarding his negotiations with the Taoiseach, to which I referred? Will the Minister reflect on the fact that the commitments he gave this House on 21 April 1998 related to persons convicted of the murder of Detective Garda McCabe &ndash; and nobody has been convicted of his murder &ndash; the convictions have been in respect of the manslaughter of Detective Garda McCabe? Can the Minister see there is a technicality which quite obviously can be challenged in the courts? What is to stop a legal challenge being mounted and succeeding in the courts in relation to the 1939 Act or the interpretation of the British-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying categorically that the position has been made quite clear and what Deputy Higgins now refers to as a technicality would I suggest be better termed as playing with semantics. The reality is that the position was made quite clear: anybody who was convicted in respect of this offence would not qualify under the British-Irish Agreement. If the Deputy wants to play with words, he should read what I said on the debate on the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill... &ldquo;the Government has made clear in its contacts with all groups its view that persons who may be convicted in connection with this murder will not come within the ambit of the Agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly believe and I say this with the greatest sincerity that it is clearly the wish of the democratically elected representatives of the people of this country that those who were convicted of this <Col N="64" /> atrocity should serve their sentences. I believe that no Minister for Justice would or indeed could find acceptance for a position whereby he would release these people under the British-Irish Agreement. I think that is something which everybody in this House accepts. I have stated again and again that it is a matter for the Minister for Justice of the day to refer the names to the commission. I will not be referring those names to the commission and I do not believe that any successor to this office will refer those people to the commission. More over it was clearly understood during the negotiations on this Agreement what the position was and I do not believe there is any need for any Member to cause, however unintentionally, the slightest worry to the family of the late Detective Garda McCabe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to the statement I read out from the Association of Chief Superintendents? Why were witnesses, who were clearly liable to be intimidated, not protected adequately? What action has the Minister initiated to bring to account those responsible for intimidation in this case? Will the Minister state clearly, in response to the question posed twice by Deputy Higgins, that the remarks made by Mr. Adams, which have been reported to the House, about his conversation with the Taoiseach at the time of the conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement are false?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state categorically that I believe those statements to be false. I have had numerous discussions with the Taoiseach in relation to this case, long before it arrived in the Special Criminal Court, in the context of the early release provisions of the Agreement and he made it very clear to me at all times that the people who were convicted of this offence would not qualify for early release under the terms of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>With regard to whether the witnesses were protected&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it is, of course, a matter for the Garda at any time to decide what level of protection, if any, witnesses should be given. In the case of Mr. Patrick Harty, to whose house it is alleged those involved in this atrocity returned following the commission of the offence, the question of the witness protection programme was discussed, but, as I stated earlier, the level of protection which he ultimately was offered was the maximum level of protection which he would accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protection was offered, certain protections were given, but it would not be appropriate for me, because of the fact that there will no doubt be other cases in the future &ndash; please God of a different nature &ndash; which might be affected, to disclose what level of protection was given. In the cases of Mr. Bewick and Mr. Bowden, they did <Col N="65" /> report intimidation to the Garda and they also were offered protection by the Garda. They accepted a certain level of protection, which the Garda was very pleased to tender.</P>
    <P>With regard to what I have done in terms of the prevention of intimidation of witnesses, we are introducing three new offences in the criminal justice Bill. This is an operational matter and the Garda Commissioner has appointed a superintendent to investigate all the allegations of intimidation and no doubt if charges can be proffered in due course, they will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Attorney General should exercise his powers under section 2(6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions over the general practice of plea bargaining? Does he further accept, if plea bargaining is to become a feature of our criminal justice system, that specific legislation should be enacted to deal with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <P>The Judiciary is not involved in any pleas which may or may not be accepted by the DPP in relation to any given case. With regard to the question of the DPP accepting a plea to a lesser charge, he would want it to be made very clear from an ethical point of view that the DPP does not charge with the higher offence to see if he can get a conviction of a lesser offence. The DPP brings forward a charge on the basis that he can prove it. The notion that the State goes into court to secure a conviction, irrespective of whether the individual is guilty of that offence or a lesser offence, is not correct. The DPP would only agree to a lesser charge where he was not satisfied that the higher charge could be established.</P>

      <P>I wish to put two questions separately to the Minister. It is more than two and a half years since Garda McCabe was killed in Adare. At the time there was a view that the group involved were dissident members of the IRA. In his discussions since with the Garda authorities, has the Minister established whether they were acting as a dissident group or whether this was an officially authorised and planned Provisional IRA act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anybody will disagree when I say that we should never give the impression that it makes any difference in terms of the gravity of the outrage which took place or the moral culpability of those involved whether the commission of the crime had the approval of the IRA hierarchy. I have no con<Col N="66" /> crete evidence available to me that it had the approval of the IRA hierarchy, though there is some indication that there may have been somebody other than those involved on that fateful day involved in this matter, but I could not be definitive in regard to the hierarchy question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister if he had concrete evidence. I asked him what was the view of the Garda authorities as communicated to him. The Minister will be aware that in part of the case that was tried in court evidence was put before the court of senior IRA officers meeting the persons who were convicted in the car park of Finnegan's near Limerick city and discussing this the night before. He will also be aware that the accused wore green ribbons, which are a symbol of the prisoner release campaign, when they were in the dock in the Special Criminal Court. He will be further aware that the prisoners are subject to the commands of the Provisional IRA commanding officer in Portlaoise prison and he is no doubt aware, as is everybody else in the country, that the leaders of Sinn Féin, Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, have been assiduous in claiming the convicted persons as their own and have been openly advocating their release under the prisoner release scheme. This happened as late as this morning on Radio Kerry. Taking all that into account, will the Minister answer the question? Is he of the view that this was an authorised operation or an action of dissidents?</P>

      <P>Allegations of ill-treatment were made against the Garda in the course of the trial in the Special Criminal Court. In connection with one of those persons, Mr. John Quinn, the court was asked to consider whether statements made by him while in Garda custody were admissible. It was the subject of a trial within a trial. In the end, the court was not required to rule on the admissibility of the statements because four of the accused men pleaded guilty to manslaughter and, in the case of Mr. Quinn, to the charge of conspiracy to rob. However, it is important and in the interests of setting the record straight it would be useful to repeat the comments of Mr. Justice Johnson in the course of his sentencing of the five men. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the last three weeks many insinuations have been made against the guards in the course of a long and detailed cross-examination on behalf of Mr. Quinn. It should be pointed out that in the course of his detention Mr. Quinn visited hospital on no less than four occasions and was examined by no fewer than <Col N="69" /> four doctors before he came to Dublin, and was in the presence of numerous ambulance men and other medical auxiliaries. At no stage did he make any complaint to any one of them regarding his treatment by the gardaí. The court is satisfied, having heard the evidence, that Mr. Quinn was treated whilst in custody strictly in accordance with law and with the utmost professionalism, despite the fact that at the particular time the gardaí must have been under immense pressure. The court was particularly unimpressed with the photographs taken of the accused leaving the hospital in Limerick and rejects absolutely the implications which it was intended that the court should take therefrom. The guards in our view, as stated, acted with patience and professionalism during the questioning and detention of Mr. Quinn.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that the court was clearly of the view that there was no ill-treatment in this case. That seems to close the matter. Mr. Quinn has made a formal complaint to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, alleging abuse of authority by the Garda, as well as the use of force and violence. These are, of course, being investigated by the board.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made by Mr. Jeremiah Sheehy about ill-treatment. Upon his arrival at Portlaoise prison, Mr. Sheehy alleged that he had been ill-treated by the gardaí and he was referred to hospital for medical examination. His allegations of ill treatment were investigated by a senior Garda officer who found that there was no ill treatment of Mr. Sheehy. Mr. Sheehy has made no complaint to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board about ill-treatment.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made generally about ill-treatment by the gardaí of those who were sentenced last week by the Special Criminal Court. I have now expressed what the position is and I sincerely hope that what I have had to say will lay to rest, once and for all, uninformed comments regarding this matter.</P>

Does the Minister honestly and sincerely expect that people who have been intimidated as such, even if they knew the names of individuals, will wreak further intimidation on themselves by revealing them? Does the Minister feel the measures he has laid down in order to <Col N="70" /> contend with this intimidation process in future will reassure gardaí who are worried about the trend that this case has taken? </P>

      <P>I have no knowledge of how plea bargaining works. It is news to me that this is in place. I hope the exploratory nature of my question will be helpful to the Minister. Presumably, the Director of Public Prosecutions was not the point of contact for such plea bargaining but the legal team for the prosecution was the point of contact, before they made a recommendation to the DPP. Will the Minister give an absolute assurance to the House that it was not intimated to the legal team, or any member of the legal team, by any solicitor, barrister or any other person, that a plea along the lines accepted would in any way be acceptable to a Minister or to the Government as a whole?</P>

      <P>Regarding the point raised by Deputy Noonan, on 9 December I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention had been drawn to the fact that an aid worker with APSO was being sought by the Garda for questioning in relation to possible criminal activities in Ireland.

    <P>In October 1996 the Garda informed APSO that they wished to interview the person concerned regarding a serious criminal offence. At that time and since, the individual has been in Nicaragua. The Garda asked APSO to provide information on his whereabouts and work. This was provided to them. On a number of occasions since then, APSO has voluntarily informed the Garda of any change in the person's situation. APSO has at all times co-operated with the Garda in this matter. It is understood, however, that no contact has been made <Col N="71" /> by the authorities with the individual in question.</P>
    <P>This relates to a prime suspect in relation to involvement in the murder of Detective Garda McCabe. He is working for a State funded agency and APSO has notified the Garda that the individual is moving between different locations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Finucane asked whether the measures which are being introduced in the new Criminal Justice Bill will be sufficient to deal with intimidation. Three new offences will be created and I hope they will assist considerably in the fight against intimidation. However, it must be remembered that there have been many paramilitary type cases before the Special Criminal Court in the relatively short time in which the State has been in existence.</P>
      <P>There was no witness protection programme before I introduced one. I do not seek credit for that, but I wish to highlight that prior to the introduction of the witness protection programme, successive Garda Commissioners offered protection to witnesses where possible or desirable. That judgment is invariably made operationally on the ground by the Garda Síochána when faced with a given situation. The measures I intend to introduce will be of considerable assistance although one cannot be certain that one will prevent intimidation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked about the legal team. I assure the Deputy that the legal team was led by one of the most experienced criminal trial lawyers in the country. He has vast experience of conducting cases such as the one in question. He advised on how the matter should progress in conjunction with other members of the legal team. The decision to accept a plea of manslaughter was honestly reached. It was not influenced by any extraneous viewpoint. There was no involvement whatsoever by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach or anybody else politically in the decision reached by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was one of the most difficult decisions the Director of Public Prosecutions ever had to reach.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to bring before this House my proposals for putting on a statutory footing the principles governing the power to deport and the procedures to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected when deportation is being contemplated in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the specifics of this important Bill I would like to tell the House briefly about my plans in the coming year for a legislative overhaul of the State's laws in the area of immigration generally and in the related area of asylum and refugees. First, I am pleased to be able to tell the House that I expect to be in a position before Easter to bring forward to the Government proposals for a short amending Bill which will enable me to make the Refugee Act, 1996, fully operational. As the House will recall, that Act was enacted against a backdrop where we had 300 to 400 applications per annum for asylum. It provided that each individual application had to be considered personally by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, where applicable, each appeal had to be considered by a five person appeal board. Clearly in circumstances <Col N="75" /> where the numbers of persons seeking refugee status here had increased from the low hundreds to almost 5,000 last year, those structures are totally unworkable. My amending Bill will primarily concentrate on amending those first instance and appeal structures so that they reflect the current realities and I look forward to having the Refugee Act fully operational in the near future.</P>
    <P>Second, the work on drafting legislation to deal with those who seek to exploit asylum seekers by engaging in the appalling and odious trade of trafficking is nearing finalisation. I expect to publish that Bill within weeks.</P>
    <P>Third, my Department is working on a major Bill to replace, modernise and codify the law on immigration and residence in the State. The principal legislative measure in place regulating immigration and residence in the State dates back to 1935, that is, the Aliens Act, 1935. I plan to overhaul this Act comprehensively and replace it with a modern code of immigration law which will provide a solid legislative framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies to meet the changing needs of Irish society. The new Act will also, of course, guarantee the rights of non-nationals in their dealings with the law. My intention is that this legislation will be ready for publication later this year. It will, in effect, be the first ever fundamental review of the State's principal legislative measure in the immigration area and I hope that it will give rise to an informed and considered debate both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>These proposals taken together with the Bill represent my plan for ensuring that in all aspects of immigration law, the principles, practices and procedures will be clearly set out in a comprehensive, modern, fair and just code of statute law. I want to arrive at a situation where the people who operate the immigration and residence legislation and the people whose lives may be affected by its operation can clearly identify what exactly they can expect from the law and what the law expects from them.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Bill before us. It is a progressive measure designed to set out in clear and unambiguous terms who is liable to be deported, the principles and practices which I and my officials must observe in each case before a deportation order can be made and a set of procedures that give an opportunity for the person liable to be deported to make representations and have them heard before the decision to deport is made.</P>
    <P>Deportation powers are essential in relation, for example, to those who flout the requirements of immigration and residence law and those who have been convicted of serious crimes or whose removal from the State has been recommended by a court in criminal proceedings. These are people who are liable to be deported under the laws of any state. The Bill identifies the categories of people who may be deported from this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The Bill spells out, for the first time in statutory form, the various aspects of each case that must be taken into account. As well as questions of character and conduct, the list includes such matters as the person's domestic circumstances, the nature of the person's links with the State, humanitarian considerations and the person's business and employment record and prospects. The Bill also spells out the requirement to give notice in appropriate cases that deportation is being considered, and gives the person the opportunity to make full representations which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The immediate background to this Bill is, of course, the judgment of the High Court in the case of Laurentiu<i> v.</i> Ireland, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, delivered by Mr. Justice Geoghegan on 22 January last. That judgment found that each step in the procedures followed in relation to Mr. Laurentiu's application for asylum, and his subsequent application for leave to remain in the State, was properly carried out. The adverse finding of the court, however, was that the power to make deportation orders vested in the Minister by the Legislature under the Aliens Act, 1935, was vested in a manner inconsistent with Article 15.2.1 of the 1937 Constitution. That article provides that the sole and exclusive power of making laws is vested in the Oireachtas and that no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
    <P>In so far as many of the provisions contained in this Bill are concerned, it had been my intention to legislate for these matters by way of ministerial orders. Much of the groundwork had already been done, and the relevant orders were about to be made. My intention was to have these provisions in place pending their incorporation in the comprehensive Bill, which I have mentioned at the outset, that is being prepared to replace and codify the law on immigration and residence.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, there are no powers to deport non-nationals from the State. In the light of the High Court ruling, it was incumbent on me as Minister to bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency to ensure that the State would have the necessary powers. There is no state which does not have a power to deport. It is a necessary power of all states. Its place in the law has been referred to in a number of judgments. Mr. Justice Geoghegan's judgment in the Laurentiu case, for example, quoted with approval a passage of Mr. Justice Gannon in the 1986 High Court case of Osheku which characterised control of the entry of non-nationals into the State, their departure and their activities and duration of stay within the State as being in the interests of the common good, a fact &ldquo;recognised universally and from earliest times&rdquo;. He went on to say that &ldquo;the integrity of the State constituted as it is of the collective body of its citizens within the national territory must be defended and vindicated by the organs of the State and by the citizens so that there may be true social order within the territory <Col N="77" /> and concord maintained with other nations in accordance with the objectives declared in the preamble to the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Turning to a separate though related matter, the State's policy on refugees is, as it must be, in accordance with international obligations. These arise by virtue of Ireland's adherence to the principles enshrined in the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees and its related protocol. Simply stated, my policy is to ensure that every non-national who is genuinely in need of the protection of this State is identified and recognised as such as soon as possible after arrival here, so that they can immediately start the process of integration into Irish society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the convention. The practicalities are that every non-national who enters, and stays in, the State needs to be dealt with as soon as possible after arrival here so that whatever rights they may have to remain in the State can be assessed humanely and fairly. As regards those who come seeking asylum, the resources and the systems are now in place to address every application within a reasonable period of time. This is because one of my first tasks on taking up office was to set about the business of obtaining resources necessary to do the job.</P>
    <P>In fairness to those non-nationals who are genuinely in need of the protection of the State in accordance with the norms set down in international conventions, it is necessary to ensure on the other hand that there are no incentives for making ill-founded or speculative claims for asylum. This is because the work needed to deal with such applications gets in the way of the important task of giving early protection to those who are entitled to it. Applications for asylum from those who have already claimed it in another EU state, or who had the opportunity to do so but did not, are returned to that country under the Dublin Convention to be dealt with there.</P>
    <P>Another important element is to ensure, as has been advocated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, that those whose applications, after a proper hearing with all the necessary safeguards as provided under our present system, turn out to be unsuccessful return to their countries of origin. While some may return willingly, in the final analysis there must be a system of deportation for those who will not so return.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government on immigration is simple. It aims to facilitate people coming here for whatever reason, be it holiday visits, study purposes, business or employment. The expectation is that those wishing to come here do what is expected of any person visiting a country not their own, they comply with the laws of the land, including the requirements of immigration and residence law. The policy is one of welcome, consistent with the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>This is not only the background to this Bill but the overall policy and legislative context in relation to all aspects of immigration. I will now <Col N="78" /> discuss, in some detail, the more important features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first element that is worthy of note is the use of the term &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;, which is defined in section 1. This expression is more in keeping with modern usage than the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo; which has been used in the Aliens Act, 1935 and in all aliens orders made thereunder. That term has a strict legal meaning and is in widespread use in the context of international immigration instruments, for example, the Schengen Agreement. It owes its origin to the Latin noun and adjective <i>alienus</i>, which simply conveys a quality of &ldquo;elseness&rdquo;. Nowadays it is more likely to conjure up images of outer space than of people from other countries. I am happier to see its use discontinued. The repeal of the 1935 Act, which I propose in the comprehensive immigration and residence legislation under development, will put an end to its usage altogether.</P>
    <P>That said, if there is ever an invasion from outer space, I have no doubt&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the aliens legislation will be revived.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is a precautionary measure taken in the light of the High Court judgment in the Laurentiu case. This is to offset any possibility that the finding of the court in relation to the power to deport could by analogy be extended to powers of the Minister under the Aliens Act to make orders relating to other aspects of immigration and residence of non-nationals. This could have consequences for the operation of immigration controls generally, for example, at ports and airports, and the Attorney General has advised that, as a precaution against that eventuality, it would be prudent to put in place a provision on the lines proposed in section 2. Subsection (2) ensures that the conferring of the status of an Act on the aliens orders will not infringe the constitutional rights of any person.</P>
      <P>The core of this Bill is contained in section 3, which provides the power to make deportation orders and spells out the principles and procedures surrounding the exercise of the power. Subsection (1) describes what a deportation order is and gives power to make such orders. Subsection (2) lists the classes of non-national who are liable to be deported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list includes those who have served or are serving prison sentences and those whose deportation has been recommended by a court in criminal proceedings. It also includes EU nationals whose conduct is such that it would be contrary to public policy or endanger national security to permit them to remain in the State. Finally, the list includes non-nationals whose asylum applications are transferred under the Dublin Convention to another convention country; those whose applications have been unsuccessful; those who are in contravention of the requirements of immigration law and those whose deportation would <Col N="79" /> be conducive to the common good. This is a list of those liable to be deported. It does not follow that every person who comes within those categories should be removed from the State. That depends on the consideration of the matters set out in subsection (6), to which I will refer shortly.</P>
    <P>The requirements to give notification of the proposal to make a deportation order and to notify the decision, once made, are set out under subsection (3). Subsection (4) sets out the information that must be given in the notice, that it is proposed to make an order, including in particular that the person has the right to make representations within 14 days.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) specifies the circumstances in which notice under this Bill need not be given. Where the person has consented to the making of an order, as at paragraph (a) of this subsection, there is clearly no need for further notice. However, there is the safeguard that the Minister must be satisfied that the person understands the consequences of a consent and there is the further protection at subsection (8) of this section to prevent deportation on foot of a stale consent given more than three months beforehand.</P>
    <P>Where a court, arising out of criminal proceedings, recommends deportation, the person will have had the opportunity in those proceedings to make a case against deportation. No notice is required under paragraph (c) of subsection (5) if the person is already outside the State. This is to cover the situation where attempts to trace the whereabouts of a non-national liable to deportation indicate that the person has already left the State for an unknown destination. Paragraph (d) excludes from the requirements of notice under the Bill a person whose asylum application is being transferred under the Dublin Convention to another convention country. The Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order, under which such transfers occur, already contains its own extensive provisions regarding notice and opportunities for representations and it would be superfluous to add another procedure under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (6) is a particularly important provision. It sets out in statute the matters to which the Minister must have regard before making a deportation order. While this provision reflects what is already the practice in my Department, its value here is that the public at large, the people whose lives may be affected by the operation of this legislation, their legal advisers and those who administer the law in this area have a clear statutory statement of policy and principles. That is one of the chief benefits of this legislation, and it is designed to accord fully with the judgment in the Laurentiu case.</P>
    <P>While the list speaks for itself, subsection (6) (j) is a restatement of the general principle first set out at section 5 of the Refugee Act that no person shall be returned to where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on <Col N="80" /> account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular group or political opinion. That prohibition, which is in operation under the Act of 1996, is based on Article 33 of the 1951 convention on the status of refugees, which forbids the <i>refoulement</i> of refugees, but goes beyond the narrow requirements of the convention in that it applies to any person whether a refugee or not.</P>
    <P>From a strictly legal point of view, it is probably unnecessary to repeat in this Bill what is already of general legal application by virtue of the Refugee Act provision itself. My view is that it is such an important consideration as to be worth repeating here in the Bill in company with the other factors for consideration.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) sets out what is required of a person in respect of whom a deportation order has been made. It also contains a valuable safeguard for such persons who have been five years or more working or operating a business in the State on the same lines as in section 5(5) of the Aliens Act 1935, that is, a three month delay on the operation of the order to give an opportunity to wind up one's affairs.</P>
    <P>The notice of the making of a deportation order gives the person an opportunity to comply voluntarily with the order by presenting himself or herself to a specified person at a specified date, time and place &ndash; which will usually be an immigration officer or the member in charge of a Garda station. If the person does not comply, it is only at that point he or she will be liable to arrest under section 5(1) of the Bill without further notice and detention with a view to effecting the removal from the State. Subsection (4) of that section limits the total period of detention on foot of a deportation order to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>That eight week limit will not include any period on remand or serving a prison sentence or any period during which there are proceedings challenging the validity of the deportation order. If a deportee seeks to delay deportation by, for instance, refusing to co-operate in obtaining a travel document from his or her country of origin, and is as a result charged with and convicted of an offence under section 8(1)(b), any time spent on remand or serving a sentence in connection with that offence will not count in reckoning the eight week period, and no advantage will accrue, therefore, to the uncooperative deportee.</P>
    <P>Along with the general power to make regulations set out in section 7 &ndash; which will deal, for instance, with the form of the deportation order and the specified places of detention &ndash; there is power to make regulations to deal with recoupment from a person being deported of the costs of the removal in appropriate cases. While the State pays the travel and other costs of most deportations, it is reasonable that, for instance, a convicted drug dealer with substantial assets in the State who is being deported after having served his sentence should pay the price of his <Col N="81" /> own ticket and the tickets of any necessary escorts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides the power to make exclusion orders where necessary for reasons of national security or public policy. This is to ensure that, for example, a war criminal or offender against human rights, about whom there is reason to expect that he or she may seek to enter the State, will not be permitted to enter the State.</P>
    <P>Such orders, made hitherto under the Aliens Act, 1935, are very rare. I understand such orders were made some years ago in relation to a former Nazi officer and a colonel in the South African police of the apartheid era. Exclusion orders have a significance in relation to the curtailment of the application of the Refugee Act, 1996, to persons named in them, and it is necessary to restate the power to make such orders here to ensure that Act can come into effect properly once the amending legislation I have promised is passed.</P>
    <P>Section 9 specifies a maximum fine of £1,500 and a maximum term of 12 months' imprisonment for summary conviction of offences under the Bill and section 10 applies the same maxima to offences under the Aliens Act, 1935, for breaches of Aliens Orders. Those were set in 1935 at £100 and six months, and have remained unchanged since then. The limits now proposed are in keeping with the maximum punishments which may be imposed by the District Court generally.</P>
    <P>There is one important aspect of this overview of the contents of the Bill I would like to reiterate before I conclude. The High Court judgment does not force on me any matter of substance which I was not already about to do in one form or another. Its effect is on the form of my proposals, not on the substance. Instead of making an Aliens Order, I am providing substantially the same by way of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In its own context, the Bill is comprehensive in relation to the deportation process. It introduces a good deal of transparency to the law in an important area. The Bill is in keeping with the Government's policy of bringing about a situation where the law on immigration is completely updated and overhauled to deal with modern day circumstances and not the circumstances of some six decades ago.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this early debate on the Bill and I look forward to it passing all remaining Stages in this and the other House as a matter of urgency. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <b>:</b> The title of the Bill is misleading. It is labelled the Immigration Bill, 1999, but it has nothing to do with immigration. I regard immigration as denoting voluntary inward action but the Bill has little to do with that. It is concerned with deportations, excluding people from the country and keeping them out. The Bill should be entitled the Deportation Bill, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate arises from the High Court decision declaring part of the Aliens Act, 1935, to be <Col N="82" /> unconstitutional. The debate is opportune and overdue because there has been a long-standing demand for a full and comprehensive debate on the whole asylum-refugee issue. The debate is welcome in that it enables us to take a critical look at the way Irish policy operates in the area of refugees and asylum seekers. It enables us, for example, to take stock of public opinion on the issue and voice the concerns of so many representative humanitarian support groups which are doing their best to articulate the rights of the many vulnerable and socially isolated people who come to this country seeking the right of residence.</P>
    <P>The previous occasions the House debated the issue of asylum included the adoption of the all-party motion on racism, the Democratic Left Private Members' Bill taken in Fine Gael time which sought to grant an amnesty to those who had made application to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the people who applied before 1 January 1998, and the brief, generally unsatisfactory exchanges during Question Time. On each occasion, enormous dissatisfaction was expressed at the manner in which the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and his Department had dealt with the issue of asylum and refugees.</P>
    <P>The Minister's abandonment of what appeared to be humanitarian concern for refugees is well illustrated in his contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Refugee Bill, 1995. On 19 October 1995 the then Deputy O'Donoghue stated in the House: &ldquo;The status of refugees is an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has any grasp of Irish history, our history books being littered with the names and the deeds of those driven from our country out of fear of persecution&rdquo;.</P>

        <b>:</b> He has jailed these people, deported them and presided over an unfair, unclear <i>ad hoc</i> system which has left asylum seekers uncertain and bewildered.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, 13 October 1997 Sky Television broadcast around the world the shameful pictures of 2,000 asylum seekers queuing for hours in pouring rain outside the Minister's Department in St. Stephen's Green to renew their identity cards. This is the treatment meted out by a country which for centuries has seen its finest young people scattered to the four corners of the world unable to obtain employment here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> That is the treatment meted out by a country which frantically lobbied influential Irish-American politicians in the <Col N="84" /> United States ten years ago to introduce a range of measures to give illegal immigrants Morrison and Donnelly visas, work permits and green cards because of the vulnerable position in which they found themselves by being classified as illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>The Minister's inconsistency and indecision became apparent from the start of his ministry. On 12 August 1997 a newspaper headline stated: &ldquo;O'Donoghue Signals Intention to Amend Unimplemented Refugee Act&rdquo;. What happened to that intention? Did he implement the Act? Just as he has done tonight, he walked away from that Act claiming that the High Court challenge of Patrick Cooney to the validity of the competition for the position of refugee applications commissioner was a major obstacle. Nothing prevented the Minister from implementing the remainder of the Act. No attempt has been made by him to request the courts to advance the court hearing and have the matter determined once and for all. The net result is that the promise made on 12 August 1997 remains another empty ministerial aspiration.</P>
      <P>On 27 August 1997 another newspaper headline stated: &ldquo;Law Change to Give Asylum Seekers New Right of Appeal&rdquo;. The intention was that appeals would be decided by an independent lawyer to be named by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. These appeals, however, were not dealt with by an independent lawyer but by unnamed civil servants in the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>On 7 August 1998 we were told that the Minister intended to introduce fast-track procedures for clearing the backlog of asylum applications. The Minister confirmed that he was abolishing the 1985 procedures under which a United Nations agency was consulted in every asylum case without exception. In future, the UN High Commission for Refugees will have the right to inspect cases but will not be automatically involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that &ldquo;the refugee crisis will be tackled head on by tough new legislative changes&rdquo;, another manifestation of his much beloved zero tolerance. The article goes on: &ldquo;under the proposed legislation penalties will be imposed on ferry companies or truckers who smuggle in asylum seekers&rdquo;. That was August 1998. It is now February 1999 and the only legislation we have dealing with the issue of asylum seekers is this Bill which was forced on the Minister by a successful High Court challenge to the 1935 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last summer there was another knee-jerk reaction and another banner headline, &ldquo;Dole cuts and army barracks for refugees&rdquo;. Thankfully both proposals were abandoned. The Minister's response on 22 January to the High Court judgment was typical of the confusion and indecision with which he has dealt with this issue. On the same day two conflicting statements were issued on his behalf. One indicated that he was considering appealing the decision to the Supreme Court and the other promised he would <Col N="85" /> implement amending legislation as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Government's disarray was well underlined in the newspaper headline on 14 July, &ldquo;O'Donoghue rejects O'Donnell call to allow asylum seekers here to work&rdquo;. In the article the Progressive Democrats Party Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ms O'Donnell, stated &ldquo;Asylum seekers waiting to have their cases heard should be allowed to take up employment. The fact that asylum seekers are prohibited from working means that many of them are labelled as scroungers&rdquo;. I agree wholeheartedly with her. Fine Gael, in common with other parties and groups, has been pressing incessantly for the right to work for asylum seekers. The article goes on, however, &ldquo;Rejecting the call Mr. O'Donoghue said Ireland already attracted a disproportionate number of asylum seekers because of what he called the generous system here&rdquo;. Thankfully Minister of State O'Donnell is supported in Cabinet by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Government now seems likely to allow asylum seekers to work. This is one occasion when I welcome the tail wagging the dog.</P>
    <P>This measure is another stop-gap effort. The Minister must appreciate that a coherent and cogent refugee and asylum policy is needed. The Minister needs to shed the paranoia which afflicts him. He needs to look at the situation in clear perspective. He should stop believing his own propaganda that Ireland is being flooded with refugees. Estimates of the numbers of refugees who have fled their countries vary between 15 and 25 million. Of these, 90 per cent remain in the undeveloped countries of the southern hemisphere. Less than 10 per cent make their way to the developed countries of the northern hemisphere. Of these a small fraction &ndash; 1 per cent of that 10 per cent &ndash; make their way to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International has pointed out that Ireland does have an unfair share of the world's refugees, a share which is unfairly small. The 1996 figures illustrate this. In 1996 Germany had 149,000 asylum applications, the Netherlands 22,860, Belgium 12,780, the UK 27,870 and Ireland 1,179. While the numbers have grown over the past two years, the ratios have remained unchanged. While one has to welcome the improvements in the regime for dealing with asylum seekers, we are still the only EU country which does not have a statutory basis for dealing with asylum seekers. Although Ireland is a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol, the terms of the Convention have not been incorporated into domestic law.</P>
    <P>We need to replace or amend the Refugee Act, 1996. If the age restriction of the commissioner is the problem, let us amend the offending section to deal with the plaintiff's grievance. I would go further. We should consider appointing three commissioners given the current number of cases and the likelihood that, with the ongoing political upheavals throughout the world, they will be required for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> Is it any wonder that in the absence of anti-discrimination legislation, given our secretive procedures for dealing with asylum seekers and the noticeable unwillingness on the part of the Minister and certain sections of the media to quell the anti-refugee hysteria, that racist movements such the Immigration Platform gather momentum?</P>
    <P>I welcome that the Minister's resistance to granting work permits has been faced down. Will he indicate to the House when the proposal to grant work permits will come on stream? Is he in a position to spell out the criteria and conditions which will apply?</P>
    <P>While granting permission to work is welcome and important, it goes beyond the simple expedient of allowing people the right to earn their keep and to contribute to the country, rather than depend on it to sustain them. The issue of asylum should be looked at within the context of an overall immigration policy. After generations of mass emigration, we are now in the happy position that there is a net inflow to the country. In 1997 immigration reached a high point of 44,000 with a net inflow of 15,000. The figures available do not specify where these 44,000 came from or why they are here. We know only that 20,000 came from the UK, 8,100 from other EU countries, 6,600 from the US and 9,300 from the rest of the world. It can be presumed that many of them were Irish people returning after some time abroad. We know that 2,883, a mere 9 per cent, were asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>A point which does not seem to be appreciated at Government level is that immigration and asylum is not just a human rights issue. Immigrants can add economic impetus as well as cultural diversity. It is patently clear that there is a major shortage of skilled labour in this country. There is little doubt that Ireland will be unable to sustain its status as Europe's fastest growing economy without a planned approach to increase in population. The Taoiseach should commission a study and seek recommendations from the National Economic and Social Council as to how the skills and abilities of immigrants and asylum seekers could be integrated into the workforce and social fabric of the country. We need to determine now the level of population increase required to meet our growing labour needs. In simple terms, Europe's least populous state cannot sustain its status as its fastest growing economy without a significant and planned increase in population. We need to accompany this policy with clear assimilation and immigration policies.</P>
    <P>The Government might look at the Israeli experience. Israel, a country with a population of 4 million and a land mass which could fit into the combined territory of Connaught and Munster, absorbed more than 700,000 mainly Russian and Ukrainian immigrants between 1989 and 1992. It absorbed a further 100,000 per annum between 1992 and 1996. Many arrived without money, a place to stay, or relatives and could not speak the langu<Col N="87" /> age. They brought with them, however, a determination to get on, a will to survive and a considerable reservoir of skills. It was feared that, as a result of the huge influx, public spending would explode, unemployment would rocket and borrowing would lead to currency devaluation and inflation. The opposite happened. The immigrants provided the dynamo which propelled the economy to new heights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is about Commissioner Pádraig Flynn and recent controversies, but more fundamentally it is about accountability in public life and public faith in the political system as a whole. The purpose of the motion is to make clear to the Commissioner that the Irish people, through their elected representatives in Dáil Éireann, want and expect him to make a clear statement on recent controversies surrounding him and Mr. Tom Gilmartin. Mr. Flynn's failure to clarify matters to date leaves a cloud hanging over him and increases public cynicism about the political system as a whole. We, as public representatives, have a duty to make clear that the stonewalling tactics adopted to date by Mr. Flynn are unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues to be clarified are quite straightforward. First, did Mr. Flynn, while a Government Minister, receive £50,000 from Mr. Gilmartin? Second, did he receive this cheque in his departmental office from a man who came to talk to him about departmental policy? Third, if he did receive £50,000, what were the circumstances surrounding the gift and to what purpose was the money put? Fourth, did Mr. Flynn contact Mr. Gilmartin subsequent to the establishment of the Flood Tribunal seeking to discuss with him what Mr. Gilmartin proposed to say or had said to the tribunal lawyers? Specifically, did he seek to get <Col N="88" /> him to change his sworn statements to the tribunal?</P>
    <P>At this stage we do not seek to condemn Mr. Flynn; rather, we seek explanations. It is not good enough now for Mr. Flynn to try to hide behind the tribunal and say that he will answer questions in due course. At present it is not even clear if he will be a witness at the tribunal. In the case of former Minister Ray Burke, he answered questions in the House which showed that he had a case to answer at the tribunal. Mr. Flynn must indicate whether he has a case to answer at the tribunal, and if so, he must then appear at the tribunal to give a full account of his actions.</P>
    <P>A whole series of allegations have been made &ndash; mainly, that as a Government Minister he met an individual in his ministerial office to discuss a policy matter and that during the course of the meeting he sought and received a donation for Fianna Fáil or himself for £50,000 with the payee left blank on the cheque. The allegation is that the payee was left blank on the instructions of Mr. Flynn himself. Fianna Fáil says it never received this money and has written to Mr. Flynn to seek an explanation, so far without success. Surprisingly, the Taoiseach never raised this directly with Mr. Flynn in their many conversations.</P>
    <P>Some Fianna Fáil figures are trying to spread muck by saying that these activities are not unusual and by saying: &ldquo;Sure doesn't everybody fundraise?&rdquo;  During my time as a Minister of State, all Ministers and Ministers of State received a Government memorandum instructing them not to meet persons to discuss policy matters in this way without civil servants present. Why were civil servants omitted from this and other relevant meetings in relation to the business of the State? This is something to which I will refer later. Was the business done for the State or was the State being used for business by Ministers?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste seem to recognise the seriousness of the issue by their request to Mr. Flynn for an immediate response. However, to make it absolutely clear to Mr. Flynn how seriously this matter is viewed, the time has come for the representatives of the Irish people in Dáil Éireann to demand such a response. Mr. Flynn showed no reticence when he went on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and regaled the country with his brilliance, honesty and denial of any charges of wrongdoing. Now that he has been challenged on these statements he must respond for his own sake and the sake of the political system as a whole.</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke got at least £60,000, Mr. Haughey at least £2 million, and Mr. Flynn allegedly got £50,000, and all of this was given to them while serving as Ministers. Why were these moneys given to them, in many cases by people they apparently hardly knew? Serving politicians have a particular duty to clarify matters, and failure to do so blackens the good name of all politicians, <Col N="89" /> including many decent Fianna Fáil politicians past and present.</P>
    <P>I reject the cant put out by some radio commentators and political spin doctors &ndash; especially some close to those currently under investigation &ndash; that: &ldquo;sure everyone was at it, all politics is at least a bit corrupt.&rdquo;  The reality is that the vast majority of politicians of all parties work hard on behalf of their constituents for a relatively modest salary and work with honesty and integrity. It is true that the vast majority of Members of this House have fundraised to pay for their campaigns, and this would have been especially true for the years from 1981 to 1992 when there were six general elections, not to mention local and European elections. How many politicians received gifts of the magnitude mentioned? How many received these from relative strangers? How many took gifts of this kind while holding office as Ministers, and in circumstances where there was a clear relationship between the gift being offered and policy issues being pursued? Unfortunately, a few bad apples threaten to give us all a bad name. The more we hear, the more extraordinary the truth seems to be. In particular, some ministerial activity between 1987 and 1992 bears ever closer scrutiny. It is not an exaggeration to say that a culture of corruption hangs over those years, which was the period of golden circles. This is not ancient history as some would like us to believe; these events happened less than ten years ago when all members of the current Cabinet were already Members of Dáil Éireann and many were members of the then Cabinet, including the Taoiseach and Deputies O'Rourke, Woods, Michael Smith, and Seamus Brennan.</P>
    <P>There are many events from that period now under investigation by the Moriarty and Flood Tribunals. Others must greatly disturb those in charge of the public purse, such as the purchase of Carysfort College, and remain to be properly explained. For example, why did it cost the State nearly £10 million to purchase Carysfort when UCD were going ahead with the purchase of a facility at Roebuck at no cost to the State?</P>
    <P>The March 1992 report of the Committee of Public Accounts sets out the precise concerns. As the Deputy who chaired that committee I again draw the attention of the House to the contents of the committee's report, as they are very relevant to much of what is being inquired into today. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, cannot pretend that these questions are not relevant to current Government accountability. These irregular practices which were reported on by the Committee of Public Accounts and raised in the Dáil have never been explained adequately.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a cancer in Fianna Fail that must be rooted out.&rdquo;  These are not my words, nor indeed the words of any member of the Fine Gael or Labour parties. They are the words of Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, speaking a week ago on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;. I stress that it would be unfair and wrong to attribute wrongdoing to all members of Fianna Fáil, but those <Col N="90" /> who are as shocked as the rest of us must speak up, even now.</P>
    <P>Let me give another example of how the business of the State, or was it the business of some Ministers, was conducted in those times. The passports for sale scheme has been much commented on in recent years. I note from newspaper reports that the Moriarty Tribunal has sought these files from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but I am not satisfied that all files relating to this scheme repose there. I suspect considerable activity in relation to this ill-fated scheme was carried out in the Department of the Taoiseach and that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, played an active part in selling Irish citizenship to wealthy foreigners who either needed it to establish residences within the European Union or to avoid paying federal taxes in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the past 18 months have failed to elicit significant information about the issue of 11 passports to the family of Sheikh Khalin bin Mahfooz but we know from reports that serious irregularities existed about the issue of these passports. We have the word of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, that he told the current Taoiseach he understood there were serious irregularities in the Mahfooz file, and that Deputy Reynolds felt obliged to advise the Taoiseach of his view in this regard and to let him make up his own mind about appointing Mr. Burke to Cabinet. The former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, left a memo on the Mahfooz file before she left office in November 1994 in which, I understand, she stated she was concerned and alarmed about its contents. She said the details of the case were highly unusual and a note about the promised investment was extraordinarily scanty by any standards. She had serious concerns about the granting of the naturalisation to the 11 persons in this case and if full, thorough and satisfactory answers to those concerns were not available, she was of the view that the certificates of naturalisation should, if possible, be revoked in each of the cases. The Taoiseach confirmed in the Dáil last October that Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn briefed him on the case in November 1994.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been extraordinarily evasive over the past 18 months in failing to let the House have any real information in relation to the passports scheme. He did, however, indicate some of the countries that gave citizenship on the same basis as the Irish Government, including St. Christopher and Nevis, Tonga, Belize, Panama, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. I need say no more about the place of Ireland in this grouping. We now know who did the business and for whom.</P>
    <P>These matters involve serving members of the Government. Those who would not turn a blind eye or look the other way, and who certainly would not conspire or assist, were punished by <Col N="91" /> being banished. We now know why Deputy O'Malley was pushed out of Fianna Fáil, and why Deputies like David Andrews and others were left on the back benches for so many years: they would not go along with the way policy was made and decisions were taken to assist those on the inside. Surely it is time we had an explanation why some of these policy decisions were made, especially when we see policy makers in office in receipt of large amounts of money from people who clearly stood to benefit. Tonight we ask for an explanation from Commissioner Flynn, no more, no less. If he were to give such an explanation we could then reach a reasoned opinion on the allegations. I hope this House asks for such an explanation and I hope he responds.</P>
    <P>I want to address also the extraordinary view that Mr. Flynn is too valuable to Ireland as our EU Commissioner to be hounded out of office over a minor matter. First, as I have made clear, these allegations are not a minor matter and require a response. Second, the view that Mr. Flynn is irreplaceable as Ireland's EU Commissioner is simply wrong. He has done a competent job on the Commission but there are a number of individuals inside and outside this House well capable of doing a good job. How can he have any credibility left in Europe if he refuses legitimate inquiries, if the Taoiseach says he is not satisfied with his responses and the Tánaiste says his position is untenable?</P>
    <P>The time for arrogance and bluster is gone, the time for explanations has come. Fine Gael is clear in its view that Commissioner Flynn must offer an explanation. We ask others to support this simple request by supporting the motion. We ask the Progressive Democrats, who proclaim their commitment to high standards and whose leader, the Tánaiste, has said Commissioner Flynn's position is untenable, to support the motion. Is the party which did so much to expose the scandals in the beef industry in those years, 1987-92, through the efforts of Deputy O'Malley, prepared to accept that Commissioner Flynn can continue to hold high office and offer no response to the current controversy? We ask Fianna Fáil, the party which asked Commissioner Flynn for an explanation and got none, to support the motion. The Fianna Fáil leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, has publicly stated that he is not satisfied with Commissioner Flynn's response to current events. He and other members of Fianna Fáil now have the opportunity to join with all the other elected representatives of the Irish people and seek that full explanation.</P>
    <P>The tribunals of inquiry were established to get to the truth of various matters. It was never intended that public officials should use them as an excuse for not offering clear responses to legitimate public concerns. Just as the Taoiseach realised that the Gilmartin allegations necessitated a public response from him, so also do they require a response from Commissioner Flynn. For years Mr. Haughey made arrogant, dismissive <Col N="92" /> responses to inquiries about the source and extent of his wealth, for reasons we now understand all too clearly. The public will no longer accept such a lack of accountability from their political leaders and those paid from the public purse, and we as politicians must make clear that we too reject the dismissive approach adopted by Commissioner Flynn in his Brussels elevator interview with RTE.</P>
    <P>This motion does not pre-judge the Commissioner, it merely asks for an explanation. In natural justice we are giving him an opportunity to make that explanation within two weeks. For all we know, there may be an explanation unrelated to the tribunals, but this cannot be determined until we hear from him. His failure to explain is unacceptable from a serving public official, brings shame on the political system and increases public cynicism. The time has come to let people, through their elected representatives, demand an explanation from Commissioner Flynn who, as he stated on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, continues to receive pensions from the taxes supplied by this House taken from the public we represent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has offered circumstantial evidence as proof against the likelihood of meetings he allegedly had with Mr. Gilmartin in the company of the then Taoiseach and other Ministers in 1989. He offered as his explanation that after 1987 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, would not have held meetings involving several people on official business in Leinster House but in Government Buildings. As was pointed out by an eminent journalist over the weekend, this view of Mr. Haughey is wide of the mark. His business &ndash; party, State and official &ndash; was done wherever he happened to be, including Kinsealy. This had been his practice throughout his period as party leader and had even provoked criticism at the constitutionality of how he conducted Government business, a point on which he was sensitive. As was pointed out by the same journalist, apart from the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, no one claimed this meeting, on whatever day it took place, was official business. Mr. Gilmartin's description, which gives it a party political slant, presents it as anything but that. The Taoiseach was quick to rely on the diaries of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and then only secondhand, to support his circumstantial evidence. The attendance of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is described as improbable. The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, has not made any statement. An independent forensic examination of all of the relevant diaries should be carried out. We simply cannot rely on Ministers absolving themselves.</P>
    <P>Bruce Arnold's news analysis article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 6 February last states:</P>
    <P>This was a culture, a way of doing business, and it embraced the finances of the Fianna Fáil party over a long number of years. It appears also to have embraced decision-making, intruded into the business of planning at the highest level, and to have been conducted in <Col N="93" /> ministerial offices, rooms in Leinster House, Abbeyville in Kinsealy, and we know not where besides.</P>
    <P>As of today, no line has been drawn separating this truly alarming past from what Mr. Ahern wishes to have seen as the more mundane present. And it will not be drawn until the issue of Mr. Flynn and the £50,000 is addressed.</P>
    <P>It is not true to suggest that sort of murky business embraced all of Fianna Fáil. There are many, clearly the majority of, Fianna Fáil members and public representatives who are mortified and ashamed of these events. There is also some hope. Two young Fianna Fáil candidates for the local elections have spoken out and are not prepared to remain silent even now. I know a number of people on the benches opposite share these concerns. The motion before the House gives them the opportunity to express those concerns and to set about separating the truly alarming past from their future. Unfortunately, the past is not separated from the Fianna Fáil of today, however unfair that may be to the majority of Fianna Fáil members. They should not blame the Opposition for that. Their misfortunes are homegrown. They will start to recover the day they start to demand accountability from those on their own benches who know the answers. For the sake of our democratic political system, I urge the House to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's motion. I regret it is necessary to debate this motion this evening. Padraig Flynn has been an excellent European Commissioner who has served the European Union well. He is personally committed to many of the ideals of the Union to which I and my party subscribe. While I had no part in the decision to nominate Commissioner Flynn for a second term of office in autumn 1994, I was happy to allow his nomination go forward in January 1995. As Taoiseach, I worked well with Commissioner Flynn and found his advice and support on European matters, particularly during Ireland's Presidency of the Union, to be of great benefit.</P>
      <P>The events for which Fine Gael seek an explanation from the Commissioner go back nearly ten years, to a time when the Government of our country was shrouded in secrecy, when it was more important for Ministers not to ask the hard question than it was to ask a hard question. It was a time when all one could do was speculate, guess or gossip about what was happening in public affairs, but dealing with issues head on was not the done thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion we debate tonight is primarily about Mr. Flynn's failure to explain the circumstances in which he allegedly received £50,000 in 1989. This debate would not be necessary if his party leader and Taoiseach had had the courage and moral authority to ask Mr. Flynn, in a straight and direct way, about these allegations when they first came into the public domain nearly six months ago. The Taoiseach never <Col N="94" /> asked Mr. Flynn the obvious question, despite having met him on at least six occasions in the intervening period. The Taoiseach never asked Mr. Flynn the hard question because the Taoiseach has built his entire political career on never asking a question that might prompt an answer demanding unpalatable action.</P>
    <P>He never asked Charles Haughey a hard question, either as his supporter or his leader. He never asked Ray Burke a hard question before appointing him Minister and instead chose to send the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on a wasteful errand to London. The Taoiseach chose to stay in Dublin, living near Mr. Burke, meeting him regularly but never asking him the one question that might have been of interest to him. He concentrated instead, by his own account, on staring into the upper regions of vegetation in north Dublin for inspiration. Not surprisingly, no inspiration was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>When allegations about Mr. Flynn first arose the Taoiseach chose, once again, to don his familiar earmuffs, eyemask and gag. He presided over the sending of a letter to Mr. Flynn by the General Secretary of Fianna Fáil, a letter which broke new ground in the way in which it begged not to be answered. It was about as convincing in seeking hard information as a tax demand sent in a Valentine's card. Not surprisingly, it has been ignored, at least until Fine Gael tabled this motion.</P>
    <P>Getting straight answers to straight questions has never been part of the culture of Fianna Fáil since Mr. Haughey and his associates ran that party. Despite Mr. Haughey's departure the culture of deniability prevails but, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, it is not shared by all members of Fianna Fáil. There are a great many decent, honourable men and women in Fianna Fáil who are appalled at what is being revealed, but problems must be confronted, not ignored, parked or evaded.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has refused to tackle the Haughey legacy in Fianna Fáil. The culture of self-service instead of public service has not been finally rooted out. To do so takes hard work and hard decisions &ndash; decisions, not rhetoric. Accountability is difficult. It is often embarrassing and sometimes it is confrontational. Accountability can disrupt personal relationships, but without it we cannot have genuine democratic politics.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to be accountable to this House for my actions. I have no problem explaining in full the reasons I telephoned Mr. Tom Gilmartin directly. The newspaper, <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>, put a number of questions to me on Tuesday, 26 January, one of which was whether I might ever have met Mr. Gilmartin. As is my practice, I wanted to give a straight, full and final answer to this media query. I decided to check it out with the only person who could definitely confirm my view that I had never met Tom Gilmartin, namely, Tom Gilmartin. I did not want to give replies based on the best of my recollection or on half-hearted trawls <Col N="95" /> through incomplete old diaries. I wanted to give a definitive answer.</P>
    <P>Confirming that I had never met him was the sole purpose of my phone call to Mr. Gilmartin on 28 January, and I did not seek to influence anything Mr. Gilmartin might say to anybody. I rang Mr. Gilmartin directly myself, because that is my approach. I do not believe in sending third parties to ask questions for me. If questions concern me directly, I ask the necessary questions myself directly. Mr. Gilmartin has absolutely and publicly confirmed that the sole purpose of my call was to establish we had no previous contact, so that I could confirm this to the media. The telephone conversation I had with Mr. Gilmartin was comparatively short, lasting a few minutes. After I had confirmed with him that we had never met, Mr. Gilmartin, of his own accord, spoke generally for some minutes about various things he had been reported on widely as discussing with various journalists in previous days. I reiterated to him that I had not rung him with the purpose of going into these issues or for anything other than to ask the question whether we had ever met. I repeat here, as Mr. Gilmartin has publicly confirmed, that I did not seek to influence in any way what he would say to anybody &ndash; tribunal, journalist or anybody else. I have had no contact with Mr. Gilmartin since that one phone call.</P>
    <P>As I was in receipt of a media query, and wanted to give a complete and final answer to it, I believe I was right to phone Mr. Gilmartin, as he was the only person who could definitively confirm my answer to the media query I had received. Some may say I should not have rung Mr. Gilmartin, but should have asked a third party to phone him, or have just relied on my own recollections to say I had not met him. That is a matter of judgment, but that is not my approach. I wanted an answer based on my direct knowledge, not information from third parties of the kind relied upon by the Taoiseach, in his Dáil speech or in answer to press queries about his contacts with Mr. Gilmartin.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has made a huge fuss about the fact that I talked to Mr. Gilmartin at all because he is a potential tribunal witness. If it really wants to set that standard, then it might also apply it to itself. If that is its standard, Fianna Fáil might then give the details of all contacts its leader has had with two other tribunal witnesses, Mr. Joe Burke and Mr. Charles Haughey, on the very issues upon which the Taoiseach, Mr. Burke and Mr. Haughey will be giving evidence to the Flood Tribunal. The Taoiseach knows that Mr. Joe Burke will be a witness to the Flood tribunal, because he brought him into it by saying he had asked Mr. Burke to follow up a property issue at the behest of Mr. Gilmartin. I assume the Taoiseach has not sought to influence Mr. Burke's recollections of their respective dealings with Mr Gilmartin, or <i>vice versa</i>. In light of the position Fianna Fáil is now taking, I assume the Taoiseach will not have further conversations with Mr. Joe <Col N="96" /> Burke about the matter on which they will both be witnesses at the planning tribunal. They already appear to have had at least one such conversation, because the Taoiseach has already relied on Mr. Burke for part of this recent Dáil speech on the issues that are before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also had contact, through his office, with another important witness on a matter on which both of them will be expected to give independent evidence to the tribunal. That witness is Mr. Charles Haughey. The Taoiseach asked Mr. Haughey to check his diaries in Kinsealy and has co-ordinated his own recollection of events for the Dáil with the evidence Mr. Haughey says he found in those diaries. Again, I assume that there will be no more such contacts between the Taoiseach's office and Mr. Haughey, on these or any other issues on which they will now be independent witnesses before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Each person responds in his own way to difficult issues. There is a difference between my approach and that of the Taoiseach. I believe in putting direct questions, to the people I know can give me the full and final answers. The Taoiseach prefers to work indirectly through third parties. The difficulty with not asking people questions directly, as I asked a question directly of Tom Gilmartin, can be seen in the Taoiseach's current difficulties. As a result of his &ldquo;no direct questions&rdquo; approach, the Taoiseach did not ask Ray Burke directly about donations he received before he appointed him a Minister. The Taoiseach did not ask Padraig Flynn directly, about the donations he obtained for Fianna Fáil. The Taoiseach apparently did not ask Charles Haughey anything, face to face, but relied on third parties and letters. That is not my approach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's indirect approach has created difficulties for him, in regard to his public accounts of his contacts with Mr. Gilmartin. It meant he had to change his account not once, but five times. First a senior Minister told &ldquo;Ireland on Sunday&rdquo; on Friday, 23 January, that, like St. Peter, &ldquo;no one in the Government knows the man&rdquo;. Such an answer by a senior Minister would hardly have been given without prior clearance from the Taoiseach. Second, on Sunday morning, 24 January, the Taoiseach said it would be &ldquo;entirely wrong to comment on such matters&rdquo;. Third, on Sunday evening, 24 January, a few hours later, the Taoiseach did comment on these matters, and said he had only &ldquo;one brief&rdquo; meeting with Mr Gilmartin and that he had &ldquo;no recollection of any telephone conversation, or of any conversation with him in regard to contributions&rdquo;. Fourth, on Tuesday morning, 26 January, the Taoiseach found records of two more meetings, but stated that he still did not recollect them. Fifth, on Tuesday night, 26 January, on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, he seemed to admit that there might, after all, have been a telephone conversation with Mr. Gilmartin, and there might, after all, have been mention of the question of a donation, but that the Taoiseach definitely did <Col N="97" /> not ask for one for himself, or for Fianna Fáil. Five changes of story &ndash; all possibly well meant, but all very confusing. Hardly up to Deputy Cowen's high standards.</P>
    <P>My general approach of directly asking the relevant questions of the relevant people &ndash; the approach I took in phoning Tom Gilmartin directly &ndash; might have served the Taoiseach better during this unhappy saga. That is a matter of judgment. We have a different way of doing things. I will do it my way.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that accountability is an important issue in public life. We would not have had the beef tribunal if Fianna Fáil Ministers, and the Taoiseach of the day, Mr. Haughey, had given straight answers to straight questions asked by various Members of the House at that time. We would not have the Flood tribunal if straight answers were given to the questions that should have been asked of Ray Burke by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. We would not have had to table this motion about our European Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, if the Taoiseach chose to confront Mr. Flynn and obtain straight answers to straight questions about alleged donations to Fianna Fáil, while Mr. Flynn was Minister for the Environment, or when the Taoiseach was treasurer of Fianna Fail with access to all its records and access to Mr. Sherwin, who, for the past ten years, knew about the donation to Mr. Flynn.</P>
    <P>The Haughey era and the various Ministers that served during it &ndash; including the current Taoiseach and several of his Cabinet Ministers &ndash; are alive and well and damaging the public credibility of our democratic system. Regrettably there is no such thing as the &ldquo;new face of Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, while these same personnel occupy senior positions in a party that remains unwilling to confront Mr. Haughey and the decisions his Government, in which the party's current leading figures participated, made during the period 1987 to 1989.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should make up its mind, once and for all, to purge itself of the Haughey era. I submit that the most appropriate place for it to do so is by spending a long period in Opposition. Fine Gael in Government has proven in the past that it expects, demands and will give full political accountability. It is ready and willing to lead our country again by means of a new Government which will lead us away from the &ldquo;fear of the unknown&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fear of what is coming down the tracks&rdquo;, that has become the hallmark of the current Administration in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is stagnating and distracted on a daily basis while many important national and European issues remain to be negotiated. It is important that the Tánaiste brings this unviable situation to an end, sooner rather than later.</P>

    <P>calls on the EU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, to make a full, immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I propose to share time with Deputies Brian Lenihan and McGuinness.</P>
    <P>While it is the convention of the House that the Opposition may put forward any motion it chooses, the Fine Gael motion is inappropriate in two important respects. First, it may well constitute an attempted political interference in the ongoing work of a tribunal established by the House. The appropriate time to debate a tribunal is when it is being established and when it has reported. Second, the Fine Gael motion attempts to establish by a roundabout way the jurisdiction of the House over a strictly independent European public official.</P>
    <P>The House has established tribunals where there are allegations of serious impropriety against elected representatives or public officials and where there is a need to investigate facts, untangle evidence and resolve any conflicts of interpretation. Tribunals provide proper safeguards for witnesses and those whose reputations are at stake. Everyone has the opportunity to put forward their case and be cross-examined on it. It is understandable that former ministerial office holders would wish to appear before a tribunal to resolve matters systematically there. We in this House might prefer that a full public statement be made in advance of and outside a tribunal. However, we have no power to curtail the rights and protections to which a public official, like other citizens, is entitled.</P>
    <P>Tribunals of inquiry are established to discover the truth. They are deliberately and properly not controlled by politicians. They are not amenable to the day to day pressures of the business of politics. Tribunals do not adopt political stances or take political sides and there are good reasons for this, as will be apparent to any Member of the House.</P>
    <P>Brussels has made it clear that it regards this as a domestic matter. My esteemed and former ministerial colleague, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, has been an exemplary Commissioner, as the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, conceded. No one has accused Mr. Flynn of any impropriety in the exercise of his duties in Brussels. He has handled a large budget effectively and has made a good impact in advancing employment policies and the social affairs <Col N="99" /> agenda, including equality and worker representation.</P>
    <P>It has also been conceded by the previous speakers that he has been a good Commissioner from Ireland's point of view. He has been able to guide successive Governments on the state of play on important negotiations and he has ensured that Ireland's interests are not ignored at the Commission table. His wisdom and experience are very necessary to us during the course of the crucial Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the immediate future the EU will be called upon to prepare the way for further enlargement, notably to embrace the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. It has taken the hugely important step of launching its own common currency, the euro, and must now ensure it is consolidated. It must also continue to address the most direct concerns of citizens in areas such as unemployment and the fight against international crime. These are challenging and difficult tasks.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Union to meet the challenges of the period ahead, including that posed by the most ambitious enlargement in its history, the member states have for several months now been engaged in a thoroughgoing review of the Union's financing arrangement in the context of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. These negotiations encompass such areas of fundamental importance as the financial framework for the Union for the period 2000 to 2006 and 2007, the future of Structural and Cohesion Funding and further reform of the CAP. The member states are called upon to take momentous and far-reaching decisions that will shape the future of the Union well into the new millennium</P>
    <P>Discussions on Agenda 2000 have now entered their final phase. This will be the central issue for discussion at the informal meeting of the EU Heads of State and Government in Bonn on 26 February and the EU Council scheduled to take place in Berlin on 24 and 25 March. The EU Council in Berlin has been identified as the deadline for reaching political agreement on the overall Agenda 2000 package. Such an agreement within the deadline prescribed is essential to equip the Union to turn towards addressing the historical challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Flynn has chosen, for his own reasons, not to respond at this time, either to political parties or to the media, to the allegation that he received £50,000 from a property developer. In doing this he has unleashed a wave of criticism and this in the light of his public statement that he will co-operate with the tribunal of inquiry that has been established by this House for that specific purpose.</P>
    <P>No political representative at any level is immune from the fallout of the current political scandals. We are all affected by them in one way or the other. I have been in politics for a long time and I know the vast majority of politicians of every party in this House are honest and hardworking people. Members will know that I <Col N="100" /> believe implicitly in justice and fairness. Experience in campaigning on behalf of the victims of miscarriages of justice, such as the Birmingham Six, the Maguire family and Giuseppe Conlon, have taught me that public anger can often lead to the decisions about the lives of accused persons which appease this anger in the short term, sometimes at the expense of true justice. Calmer reflections later on, often in the face of powerful opposition from the establishment, can throw up the errors of such hasty judgment. Trial, conviction and sentence by the House without due process &ndash; the modern day equivalent of lynching parties in the Wild West &ndash; may be an acceptable diet for some but ought not to be on the menu in a responsible and democratic Parliament.</P>
    <P>This is why we are here today. The members of Fine Gael, all 54 of them, have put their names to this motion. They seem unwilling to acknowledge that they have participated in establishing a tribunal of inquiry chaired by a judge of the High Court and charged with the responsibility for investigating improper payments to politicians. They may even claim sole responsibility for establishing these tribunals. Yet, they seem unwilling to await the proper investigation of these matters by this tribunal. Is this in a genuine pursuit of truth or just another political stunt aimed at throwing mud around in the hope that some of it will stick to the Government?</P>

      <P>However frustrating we may find the present lack of information about what precisely happened ten years ago, it would not be in Ireland's interest to withdraw our support from our Commissioner.</P>
      <P>My late father was a public servant all his life. Like the fathers of other Members of this House he helped build this nation. He entitled his second volume autobiography <i>Man of No Property. </i>The founding ethos of Fianna Fáil was not about flaunting wealth or power; it was about serving the people. Office holders were noted for their frugal lifestyle. Part of the progress we have made this century is that the majority of Irish people now own some property of their own and have the opportunity to enjoy a relatively comfortable life, though there is still much poverty.</P>
      <P>In my party we are determined to eliminate any bad practices that have grown up over the years and to rededicate ourselves to the ideal of public service. We are as interested as anyone in getting to the bottom of allegations of wrongdoing in a proper, structured way and we call on the full co-operation of anyone who can throw light on them.</P>
      <P>I have known Pádraig Flynn for many years and I like him. I know him to be as able and hardworking a politician as ever graced this House. If he is guilty of wrongdoing &ndash; it is my fervent hope he is not &ndash; then he must, and will, face the consequences. The same fate awaits those other politicians and former politicians who tragically stand accused at present and those who may be implicated in the future. Those found to be guilty of wrongdoing will have done great harm to all of us. They have seriously damaged the faith of ordinary people in the political process and the sooner this chapter of politics is closed the better.</P>
      <P>Let the message go out, by all means. Sound the warning bells. There is no place in Irish politics for corruption and the casualties must be counted as object lessons for politicians. That is the message the Taoiseach has given. It is clear and unambiguous and I believe that the sins of the past will not be repeated under his leadership. My faith in the Taoiseach's resolve in this matter is unshakeable.</P>
      <P>At the closing stages of my career in politics it is with great sadness that I have watched the tale of corruption unfold. I get a pit in my stomach listening to it and looking at it. I have been moved by the disbelief and disappointment that has been the universal reaction of members of the public and of the ordinary members of my party. These are people we all know. The people put their faith in us as their representatives and now they feel badly let down. Party workers throughout the country quietly work year in and year out for my political party for no reward other than the genuine friendships that politics create. They are deeply hurt and offended by the sleaze and they make no secret of it. They and people of all political parties and the public deserve better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> I urge every Member to put the integrity of this House first. We should be patient at a time when patience is an elusive element in the day to day business of politics.

      <P>The discussion was opened in an extraordinary manner by Deputy Gay Mitchell. I took note of the various issues he raised before he addressed the substance of the motion. He referred to passports for sale, Carysfort College, receipts of moneys by Charles J. Haughey and Mr. Raphael P. Burke, the position of the diaries of Mr. Haughey and a file on naturalisation for Sheikh Khalin bin Mahfooz. These matters have no relationship to the motion tabled by his party which did him the honour of asking him to move it in this House.</P>
      <P>Little was said by Deputy Gay Mitchell in support of the motion but a great deal was said about the Fianna Fáil Party, both as a political organisation and as a collection of Deputies. One of the difficulties the Fianna Fáil Party as an organisation has had in connection with some of these matters is that the persons associated with them are no longer members of or amenable to that organisation. As a convinced European, Deputy John Bruton must be aware that a European Commissioner cannot have political ties of that character.</P>

I understand a precautionary letter, which the Taoiseach read into the record of the House, has issued in that respect.</P>
      <P>We have gone a long way towards meeting the Opposition on this motion because we agree that Dáil Éireann should request the Commissioner to make a full and immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We join with the Members who have tabled this motion in making that call because this matter has generated immense public interest. We and the public want an explanation so that we can continue to prosecute the affairs and interests of Ireland as a member state of the European Union with vigour and efficiency in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>We do not agree with the full terms of the Fine Gael motion for the reasons laid out in the Minister's speech. There are three reasons we do not agree with the part of the motion which states that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann shall, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, consider whether it is of the opinion that Mr. Flynn should continue in office in those circumstances&rdquo;. First is that we have set up tribunals to investigate these matters. They have been established to pass judgment on the facts proven and established before them.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference agreed by the Government for a tribunal established by this House to investigate planning matters are wide-ranging. I refer to the recent Supreme Court judgment in its analysis of Article 5 of the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal. That article provides that:</P>
      <P>In the event that the Tribunal in the course of its inquiries is made aware of any acts associated with the planning process which may in its opinion amount to corruption, or which involve attempts to influence by threats or deception or inducement or otherwise to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties, it shall report on such acts and should in particular make recommendations as to the effectiveness and improvement of existing legislation governing corruption in the light of its inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a wide-ranging term of reference. The Supreme Court had an opportunity to consider it in judicial review proceedings brought by an applicant, Mr. George Redmond, in which he <Col N="104" /> named the chairman of the tribunal of inquiry and which proceedings were determined by the Supreme Court on 6 January this year. The Supreme Court stated:</P>
    <P>It is clear from the terms that the Tribunal has interpreted the paragraph as entitling the Tribunal to inquire into and report on any acts associated with the planning process which may in its opinion amount to corruption or which involve attempts to influence by threats or deception or inducement or otherwise to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties. ... The words of the paragraph are clear and admit only of one interpretation. ... By virtue of such paragraph the Tribunal is obliged to report on any act associated with the planning process, of which it becomes aware in the course in its inquiries, and which in its opinion, may amount to corruption or tend to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court went on to say that we could have established a tribunal to look into corruption in the planning process if we so wished. It is open to us, therefore, to inquire into suspected cases of corruption and such other cases as might be brought to its attention in the course of its inquiries.</P>
    <P>These are grave matters which are within the remit of the tribunal of inquiry. It is not open to us to pass judgment on a former Member in the manner proposed in the Fine Gael motion when we consider the wide-ranging scope of the tribunal's powers. The fact is that the tribunal may look into any matter that arises in the course of its inquiries and it is clear from what we have read in the newspapers that the tribunal is so engaged in relation to Mr. Gilmartin and Commissioner Flynn. Since we established this tribunal on that basis, we must leave it. However great our curiosity and impatience, the tribunal must be allowed to do its work.</P>
    <P>A second matter to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred is natural justice for Commissioner Flynn. When Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden they got a hearing from the Almighty. It appears Deputy Bruton believes we should entertain the banishment of Commissioner Flynn without him giving him the hearing he wishes before the tribunal.</P>

We are making a different point Deputy Shatter. We accept in our amendment that he should give an explanation to the country; that point is not in dispute. What is in dispute is whether this House should consider in a fortnight's time whether Commissioner Flynn should continue in office. That is the matter I am addressing and my point is that it is not open to us to address this matter because Commissioner Flynn has expressed the view that he wishes his case to be presented to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>It amazes me that the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party unanimously put its signature to a motion which is inconsistent with the very nature of our obligations in the European Union. The Fine Gael Party has always put itself forward as the great party of the European ideal. Passing reference was made to that ideal by Deputy Bruton. What is clear in relation to the position of the Commissioner is that the Commissioner is accountable as a Commissioner and not as former Deputy Pádraig Flynn or as a former officeholder where the rules of this House apply. As Commissioner, he is accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council of Ministers and the institutions of the European Union. Calls from the national parliament of a member state to resign can only erode and undermine the position Ireland has to take in the difficult negotiations in the months ahead.</P>

    <P>I refer to Deputy Bruton's intervention and his decision to put on record his conversations with Mr. Gilmartin. I was not among those who joined the charge in rebuking Deputy Bruton in that respect and I accepted his good faith when he said that he did not attempt to influence him in any way. Were he to have done otherwise, he would have embarked on a conspiracy to defeat the course of justice and I would not believe that of a Member of this House. Whether it was prudent of him to make the telephone call in the circumstances is questionable because in my judgment if Deputy Bruton was guilty of any sin it is the sin of curiosity and impatience, the sin that vitiates the Fine Gael motion. Deputy Bruton should let the tribunal get on with its work, upon which he as a Member of this House has asked the tribunal to embark. There is one matter which Deputy Bruton did not address in relation <Col N="106" /> to his conversations and I would like to ask him how long was his telephone conversation with Mr. Gilmartin.</P>

I have been disappointed. Increasingly it appears to me that we have lost the initiative and we have been diverted from the job we should be doing and, as a consequence, the democratic process has been and continues to be subverted. The country is now being run in part by the press and the Civil Service. We are in awe of the former and we have absolutely no idea what to do about the latter. I do not blame either because nature abhors a vacuum. We the politicians have allowed a vacuum to occur. We play party political games and prostitute the political process in an unseemly hunt for headlines and drone on and on about a process now in train, responsibility for which we have handed to somebody else. We spend huge chunks of time here and elsewhere explaining that the people have a need to know.</P>

      <P>The people know the tribunals are doing their job and we are wasting time and money taking pot shots at each other in this House. The public will not thank us for that. We have asked the tribunals to establish the facts. The tribunals are doing that and it appears they are making a good job of it but, by the time they are finished, the country, because of the way it is run, will have taken a substantial beating. I believe that individuals who have questions to answer should provide those answers. I believe that Commissioner Flynn should make a statement out of respect for democracy and the high office he held in this country and the office he holds in the European Union. I have no doubt the tribunals will discover the truth. When their conclusions are laid before us I expect that individuals will be brought before the courts and justice will be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunals should be allowed to get on with their job and we should stop using every new often unproven allegation as an opportunity to score points and grab headlines. We should be engaged in putting the country on a footing that will ensure that the gaps in the system of governance which allowed this to happen during the past <Col N="107" /> ten years are blocked and the authority and reputation of this House are restored. We now know that is necessary. What concerns the public is that the tribunals demonstrate that the system is too lax and that the process is not transparent enough. The unavoidable fact is that this happened because hundreds of eyes were averted and hundreds of hands were sat upon and voices were never raised. It is not just that men do evil but that good men do nothing.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the current system denies legislators the opportunity to legislate. The Civil Service and local government system need to be radically overhauled and made more efficient and transparent. It is not only politicians who must become more accountable. In the present system politicians are accountable for decisions they have no time to check or even understand. Let us not forget that many millions &ndash; far more than the tribunal is presently dealing with &ndash; have been lost or mismanaged in the recent past.</P>

      <P>On Monday, 25 January 1999, I issued a statement following the condescending, arrogant and offensive performance by the European Commissioner for Social Affairs, Pádraig Flynn, on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and subsequent comments by Mr. Tom Gilmartin. I stated that, notwithstanding any investigations by the Flood tribunal, issues pertaining to people who hold high office in this State must be answered. It simply is not acceptable that respect for our democracy should be further diminished by allegations of wrongdoing which are left unanswered, possibly for months or even years, concerning senior politicians.</P>
      <P>I further added &ndash; and I make no apology for this political point &ndash; that those who had taken to lecturing on ethics and their new model Fianna Fáil Party have a particular obligation to put their new mantra into practice. Initial reaction to my statement was not encouraging. Fianna Fáil, the party which, through innuendo and constant sniping, had sought to undermine the function played by tribunals in our democracy became overnight the born again party of tribunals. We have had evidence of that already. &ldquo;The matter should be left to the tribunals&rdquo; became Fianna Fáil's new refrain. By the middle of the week, conveniently overlooking his original reticence towards these issues, the Taoiseach began to talk about having established the tribunals himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is now fully in favour of tribunals and their work. I have no doubt that in the current circumstances the same people, who just <Col N="108" /> over one year ago refused to allow a tribunal to investigate the Ansbacher accounts, would be queuing to facilitate such an investigation now. This new found enthusiasm for tribunals of inquiry stands in stark contrast to Fianna Fáil's normal attitude towards tribunals. All of us know the form. It begins with whispering about the costs, which we had a number of minutes ago. No mention of a tribunal is made without an accompanying reference to its cost and expense. The second element in a two-fold strategy is to begin the muck spreading exercise.</P>

      <P>The refrain of &ldquo;they are all the same and we are no worse than the rest of them&rdquo; is repeated throughout the country, but eventually the kick into touch &ndash; in this case the kick into the tribunal &ndash; had to cease. That point was accepted <i>de facto</i> by the Taoiseach when he came into the House on Wednesday, 27 January, to address what he knew about the alleged £50,000 payment to Mr. Flynn. In his closing remarks during that debate the Taoiseach stated that &ldquo;when questions are raised in the public domain I answer them.&rdquo;  The credibility of this statement diminishes by the week, but I will return to this issue later.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Flynn, on the other hand, has refused to address any of the allegations made against him, marking him out from the leader of his former party. I believe this to be unacceptable. Whether Mr. Flynn merely received £50,000 for his own use or knew that others had made beneficial use of it, the allegations represent complicity in a crime. His behaviour has brought shame on his party and, as is becoming increasingly clear in Europe, on this country. It has also brought this motion, largely supported by his former party colleagues, upon him.</P>
      <P>Mr. Flynn has done well out of this country. His political career has been marked by some of the highest accolades that politics can bring. He has served as councillor, Deputy, Minister and, latterly, as a European Commissioner and will probably earn a pension from all of them. As he stated on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, he has three houses and a salary well in excess of £100,000. Mr. Flynn owes this country something. All of us are owed more than the contempt with which we are being treated at the moment. The question is simple. Did he receive £50,000 from Mr Gilmartin? If he did, what did he do with it and does he know why it was not passed on to the Fianna Fail Party in Mount Street?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partly because of the Government's attempts to be too clever by half, we are facing a difficult situation on a series of European issues. While it is true that a commissioner does not directly represent the nation state from which he or she comes, he or she can bring influence to bear on that country's behalf. At this stage, Ireland, and its farming families in particular, need all the <Col N="109" /> influence they can muster. Mr. Flynn is an intelligent man. He must know that the longer a cloud hangs over him and his former party, he runs the risk of becoming a lame duck Commissioner. He knows the Taoiseach, who is becoming particularly adept at cutting his former friends adrift, will not reappoint him later this year. The Taoiseach has already sent out his spin doctors to inform the public of precisely that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Flynn's continuation in his position undermines our position in Europe. The motion before the House is not the problem as, no doubt, some of Mr. Flynn's friends will claim. Mr. Flynn's actions and inaction, and they alone, are the problem. I welcome the fact that Mr. Flynn has committed himself to co-operating with the tribunal, although I find his constant assertion that he will do so &ldquo;if asked&rdquo; disturbing.</P>
      <P>The motion before us is reasonable. The Commissioner is being asked to do something which he should have done already. If the Fine Gael amendment is accepted, it will allow the Dáil to give its opinion on the Commissioner's behaviour and allow us to return to the matter, if even that ignominy does not generate a response from the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy Lenihan's comments. We are asking for a very simple and straightforward response from Mr. Flynn, a net answer to a very clear question. Did he receive the money from Mr. Gilmartin? The same question was put to him in writing by the Fianna Fáil Party last year. We are not asking him to go into anything else. That is all he must do and then proceed to answer detailed questions in the tribunal but his very refusal to even answer that question over the next number of weeks would have to be indicative of his contempt for this House and the country. That is why I disagree with the weak defence, although I understand why it was put forward, by the Deputy on behalf of his former colleague.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the issue I raised earlier, namely, the attitude of the Taoiseach to questions raised in the public domain involving himself and his management of the Fianna Fáil Party. It appears that the generosity of the Taoiseach's position in summing up his contribution to the debate on 27 January left him soon afterwards. That much became clear when, only a week later, he refused to answer questions on the first set of questions to emerge about his testimony. Questions I tabled this week to the Taoiseach on this issue were ruled out of order on the grounds that the Taoiseach is not answerable to the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that the Ceann Comhairle's office has no role whatsoever in determining whether a Taoiseach, Tánaiste or Minister has a responsibility to answer questions in the House, although he frequently gets the blame for refusing them because he is the bearer of bad news. The Taoiseach stated at the end of his contri<Col N="110" /> bution on 27 January that as other facts emerged he was prepared to answer questions. I understand him declining to answer questions if doorstepped by journalists at different functions; he can attend up to 20 functions per day or meets 20 people and may be distracted.</P>
    <P>However, in response to specific written questions arising from an analysis of his comprehensive response to the series of statements and questions on 27 January, the idea that he is hiding behind the formula that he has not or is not responsible to this House for the matter referred to in those questions is a complete contradiction of the undertaking he gave that day. We will return later to him on that matter because we will not let it rest there. However, revelations in this week's newspapers throw up another series of questions in addition to those he refused to answer. In fairness to the Taoiseach, he could not have fully contemplated this series of questions on 27 January but, if he felt the need to answer questions in the public domain then, I fail to see what has changed since.</P>
    <P>In his speech to the House the Taoiseach sought to put question marks over the motivation behind Mr. Gilmartin's allegations. The point remains however, that Mr. Gilmartin's memory, unaided by the organs of State and Departments, remains every bit as sharp as that of the Taoiseach. The revelations in today's newspapers that, on a check of Leinster House records, Mr. Gilmartin had four meetings with the then Minister for the Environment, while not proof of all his allegations, is at least indicative of a pattern.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already put it into the public domain that he could not have been present at a meeting with other Fianna Fáil Ministers and Mr. Gilmartin. Will he now reveal a full list of his appointments on that day, 1 February, and those of his fellow Ministers in 1989?</P>
    <P>For the record, my understanding is that the checks conducted by the Superintendent of the House are limited only to the visitor's log kept at the front gate of Leinster House and not the more comprehensive book kept at the inquiries office. Given Mr. Gilmartin's account of events, namely, that he was collected by Deputy Lawlor at Buswells Hotel and then personally brought over to the House, all of us know that a record of his entry to the House is unlikely to have been among those unearthed by the Superintendent. My understanding is that the records for the front gate have been kept, going back over ten years, but the records for the inquiry office &ndash; which are much more rigorous because nobody can get past the inquiry office if they are not a Member of this House or an authorised person &ndash; are shredded after five years. I want to put on record my concern that this is a fact. I wish to have it verified by the Ceann Comhairle's office, which is the office responsible, to ascertain whether this is the case. We all know Deputies can come past the Kildare Street entrance with a colleague, friend or visitor and not have the name or identity of that person registered in the log book at that entrance. <Col N="111" /> However, one cannot do the same when one gets to the inquiry office. Therefore, the records of the inquiry office will determine accurately whether Mr. Gilmartin was in Leinster House on the occasions he claimed he was and whether he had been brought in by Deputy Lawlor.</P>
    <P>The controversy which has arisen around the contacts between Mr. Gilmartin and the Leader of Fine Gael is as interesting for what it says about Fianna Fáil's attitude as it says about Deputy John Bruton. My own view is that Deputy Bruton was probably unwise to contact Mr. Gilmartin directly at this stage but that, given the record of the conversation which Mr. Gilmartin has put into the public arena, absolutely no correlation can be made between Mr. Bruton's contacts and those alleged to have been made by Mr. Flynn to Mr. Gilmartin. I would certainly add to that having listened to Deputy Bruton give a very comprehensive response to that aspect of that matter earlier.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil knows this, of course, but in its desperation it has been quick to latch on to anything. If Deputy Bruton is guilty of anything, it is allowing of Fianna Fáil to create a smokescreen. However, Deputy Bruton's genuine concern about ferreting out the facts in relation to his own party &ndash; as he elaborated in some detail earlier &ndash; stand in stark contrast to the attitude of Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach. Never was a party so unconcerned about the loss of £50,000 from its accounts. Oh that we could be all so blasé about such a substantial sum of money. So far the Taoiseach has not even spoken to Commissioner Flynn about it. In fact, the energy expended so far merely extends to a single Oireachtas envelope, the postage of which was pre-paid.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Tánaiste, who took it upon herself to initiate an investigation of the Ansbacher accounts, has sought to speak to the Commissioner about the same matter. The Taoiseach's lack of concern stretches beyond that of the money allegedly handed over to Mr. Flynn. The key question which must now surround Fianna Fáil's new code of conduct is who intends to enforce it? Not the Taoiseach, if present practice is anything to go by.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach does not appear to be particularly interested in allegations made against his party's head office by a South County Dublin councillor, Mr. Colm McGrath, and he does not appear to want to exchange words on any difficult subjects with the Commissioner. I suspect the party is not too hot on the trail of the £10,000 missing from a Castlebar bank account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> In fact, it appears the only person he has spoken to is the ever retracting Deputy Lawlor who, like the Taoiseach himself, will probably be a witness to the tribunal and who, as such &ndash; to use the logic expounded by various Fianna Fáil spokespersons over the last few days &ndash; should not be talking to each other at all.</P>
    <P>This was the second point I made in my original statement &ndash; that those who were given to talking tough about standards in public life, had to start acting tough. The Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party have conspicuously failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the media reports this morning, the Labour Party has not entered into negotiations with the Government over this motion. While I welcome the fact that the Government has agreed to join the rest of the House in seeking a statement from Commissioner Flynn, its motion does not propose any action if, as I suspect, the Commissioner simply ignores our stipulation. It is time that Commissioner Pádraig Flynn was called to account. To some extent, as we have already heard, our hands are tied. The hiring and firing of an EU Commissioner is not within the remit of this House, but we have a duty to express a view on behalf of those whom we represent and I am happy that the House has chosen to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the growing consensus in this House, with the possible exception of the Minister for Health and Children, that only the highest standards can be tolerated and that there must legislative penalties for those who do not obey them. This new consensus is a far cry from the suspicion which greeted my party's intention to introduce ethics legislation at the start of this decade.</P>
    <P>It is now ten years since 1989 but the politics of that age continue to haunt us all. In particular, they haunt Fianna Fáil, the largest party in the State. I said before Christmas that there was a particular responsibility on this Taoiseach to lance the boil of that generation. To date, he has singularly failed to do so.</P>

      <P>I wish the Deputy's party would, but I do not hold out much prospect of it. I raised this issue in a speech in Limerick last Friday. As is sometimes the way, the speech received minimal coverage but I noted that last Sunday, Ms Emily O'Reilly echoed the substance of my sentiments. In particular, she posed the question which lies at the heart of new Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach in particular. I quote from her article:</P>
      <P>If Bertie Ahern is to be believed in his claim that he intends to root out party sleaze, he must demonstrate it with actions, be it a condemnation of those against whom substantial allegations have been, or sanctions being brought to bear on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you Sir, for allowing me to raise once again, the factory closures in my constituency &ndash; this time the closure of the Schiesser plant in Clonmel. Friday's announcement of 150 job losses in the Schiesser plant in Clonmel was devastating news for the town and south Tipperary as a whole. Although it may be of little comfort, I join in solidarity with the workers who will shortly leave the factory for the last time. These job losses are particularly heart-breaking because south Tipperary has suffered a litany of factory closures in recent times. The effect of the massive job losses associated with the closure of companies such as Tambrands, Digital, Seagate and many others is still impacting on many hundreds of families throughout the county of Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the job task force set up to find replacement industries has had some success, it will take further massive inward investment to re-employ the hundreds of people who lost their jobs through recent devastating closures. For many people living in south Tipperary, the litany of closures is more reminiscent of the depressed era of the 1980s than the roaring late 1990s and the Celtic tiger. South Tipperary needs specific and special treatment to deal with the scale of job losses in recent times.</P>
      <P>The people who are being let go from Schiesser must be assured of their future. Many of the workers have expressed concern that they may not have the interview skills or the relevant qualifications to compete for new jobs because, for many of them, Schiesser has been their only job. Others have suggested that their age may come against them as they try to re-enter the jobs market. I call for assurances from the Government to ease the fears which have been expressed to me in recent days by the devastated workforce of Schiesser.</P>
      <P>A task force must be appointed as a matter of urgency to deal with the needs of the workers at the Clonmel plant. Skills assessments need to be carried out, specific training must be provided which is relevant to the needs of the workers and new replacement jobs must be found. I call on the company, which provided quality jobs in its time with good pay and conditions, to ensure that the factory premises which it is vacating will be made available through the IDA to potential investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of finding replacement employment, I point out the need to create a good mix of employment opportunities deriving from multinational investment and indigenous industry. Over the past number of years, often there has <Col N="114" /> been an over-emphasis on creating jobs through inward foreign investment. While most of these jobs have helped the economy to grow, the closure of some foreign multinationals has had a crippling effect on local towns and communities.</P>
    <P>Clonmel in particular has suffered an over-reliance on multinationals and foreign companies. Some people who became unemployed following the closure of Digital regained employment when Seagate opened. However, they have since become unemployed again. Unemployment has a devastating effect not only on individual workers who lose their jobs but also on their families and local communities. The depth of this devastation is much worse when a community is repeatedly forced to come to terms with unemployment.</P>
    <P>Any task force which the Minister of State may set up as soon as possible should help the redundant workers at Schiesser's plant. This should be given the remit of drawing in a mix of indigenous and foreign replacement industries. If all our eggs are put in one basket, Clonmel will never recover and regain its thriving independence. I am concerned that the jobs record in Tipperary south in recent times may act as a deterrent to young people settling in the area. While the live register figures for the entire country appear to be on a consistent downward trend, Tipperary's separate figures indicate worrying upward blips.</P>
    <P>Clonmel and the other major towns of south Tipperary, including Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town, Cashel and Cahir, are all interdependent. They do not want the rug to be pulled out from under them. The people of Tipperary want to benefit from the economic boom that is evident everywhere else. They want to enjoy those fruits for some time to come. The workers from Schiesser do not want to join the dole queue and fear that they may never work again unless the Minister of State and the Government take a special interest in their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Ferris's concern about the recent development at Schiesser International Limited. The fact that the company has decided to cease operations with the loss of 135 jobs will have come as a severe blow to the workforce. I am deeply disappointed at this development.</P>
      <P>Schiesser International was established at Clonmel in 1966 to produce men's underwear. A second factory was subsequently established in Carrick-on-Suir to meet expanding demand for the company's products. Due to competitive pressure in the clothing market, the company undertook a major global restructuring programme in 1996. The company redefined its brand and directed it towards specialist retailers. As part of this restructuring, the company consolidated its operation at the Clonmel plant and closed the Carrick-on-Suir factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased competition and intensified price pressure in the market has now led to a downturn in trade for the Schiesser company and a need for <Col N="115" /> it to further restructure its organisation. Measures are being taken by the company to move production from western and southern Europe to eastern Europe. These measures have led, unfortunately, to the Schiesser group's decision to close the Clonmel operation.</P>
    <P>There are also job losses elsewhere in the Schiesser group. By the end of spring 1999, over 1,000 production jobs will be lost at a number of Schiesser operations in Germany with further job losses expected in other facilities in Western and Southern Europe.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, labour intensive sectors such as textiles, in Ireland and throughout the European Union are coming under increasing competitive pressures, especially from low cost producers in eastern Europe and South-East Asia. In an increasingly open and global marketplace, companies operating in these sectors must adjust to the challenges which are presented in order to survive and remain viable. The Deputy will have heard this statement made by me and other Ministers on other issues. The previous Government also had to deliver this unfortunate message.</P>
    <P>While the support agencies play an important role in helping industry to develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which a company positions itself. The State development agencies, in particular IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, have been made aware of our determination to focus on the creation of new job opportunities in the regions. The excellent work of these agencies proved very successful during 1998 with two major overseas announcements for Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Guidant Corporation announced a medical device project which will employ in excess of 500 people at full development. In addition, Clonmel Healthcare has announced a 200 person expansion of its facility which already employs 215 people. These projects will have a positive impact on employment in the town of Clonmel over the coming years. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has approved £100,000 in grant assistance towards a new enterprise centre in Clonmel. This centre comprises seven units of 1,000 square feet each, three of which are under negotiation for a project to employ 30 people.</P>
    <P>These are positive trends for Clonmel. However, in view of the closure of the Schiesser operation, the development agencies have been asked to activate the interagency response mechanism to tackle job losses of this kind. Already the IDA has circulated its overseas offices with details of the Clonmel facility and I hope that the strenuous campaign being mounted by the various agencies will have positive results for Clonmel. FÁS has also arranged to meet with management and employees in Clonmel to undertake detailed skills profiles and plan training to enhance the employees' prospects of re-employment. I am confident that, as has been shown in the past, through the immediate response of the <Col N="116" /> agencies, a successful outcome to difficult closures can be effective.</P>

        <b>:</b> It is nice to see Ministers with responsibility for issues coming to the House to deal with important questions.</P>
      <P>The centenary of any organisation is an important event. As humans, we all aspire to being centenarians but it is not easy. For an organisation to survive for 100 years, there must be great dedication on the part of the many people who have been in charge. When the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was founded 100 years ago, there was a serious cause for worry about alcohol abuse. Even in the present day, there is still concern about alcohol abuse. I compliment the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association on the wonderful contribution it has made to Irish life. It is not enough to say we appreciate its work, we should show it.</P>
      <P>An Post has the opportunity to show that appreciation by issuing a centenary stamp. This request has been made and it would be a wonderful gesture for the association to be honoured in that way. If Croke Park is prepared to give it facilities and the Garda are prepared to man the bearna baoil, the least An Post can do is commemorate it with a stamp, which it was asked to do. I ask the Minister to use her good offices to ensure that when the association celebrates its centenary, the State, through the work of An Post, will honour it by issuing a stamp.</P>
      <P>I do not need to expand on this further. I am worried about the number of sheets the Minister is holding; I am afraid she is going to hit me with a long litany of excuses. I ask the Minister, regardless of what she has been told, to ensure that those who make these decisions in An Post &ndash; who have been given a couple of years to prepare &ndash; use their common sense to honour so many eminent pioneers who are still alive and who enjoy themselves as much as those who think that drinking to excess is a part of life. I ask the Minister to use her influence to ensure the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association is shown the respect it deserves.</P>

      <P>I am a lover of poetry and I will quote some for the Deputy now. When I spoke on this in the Seanad some months ago, we were busy digging up suitable quotations. I hope the Deputy will forgive me for using the same quotation by G.K. Chesterton, who was right about getting drink in perspective, when he wrote:</P>
      <P>And Noah he often said to his wife when</P>
      <P>he sat down to dine,</P>
      <P>I don't care where the water goes if it</P>
      <P>doesn't get into the wine.</P>
      <P>He was a wise man. I am also reminded of the advice given almost two thousand years ago by St. Paul who, in writing to Timothy, suggested that he &ldquo;drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake&rdquo;, a sentiment with which I agree.</P>
      <P>Many of us drink wine; it is good with food and conversation. Medically it is now believed to be good for one's health. However, drinking to excess is wrong. I taught history and I realise the importance of Fr. Matthew. He preached his message in times of great deprivation, particularly for families. The zealotry of his campaign was necessary at that time, although that is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association deserves our respect. Many Deputies and Senators from all sides of both Houses, including the Taoiseach and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, requested the issuing of a commemorative stamp. However, no Minister in my Department has the right to order An Post to issue one. However, I advised An Post, in the nicest and politest way, that there was an all-party wish that a stamp be issued. There was 84 suggestions, which is almost double the 45 which can be accepted each year.</P>
      <P>I wrote to An Post and the Cabinet then discussed the issue at the instigation of the Taoiseach &ndash; I hope I am not divulging Cabinet secrets. An informal decision was made that I would contact An Post again and gently remind them that there were stirrings of discontent. I received a very nice letter from the chairman of An Post, Mr. Stephen O'Connor, dated Thursday, 4 February. I was in Cork on Friday so I received it yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter with the Minister of State. Since becoming the Labour Party spokesperson on older peoples' issues, I have articulated the Labour Party policy that all persons over 65 years should be entitled to free medical care. We must ensure that the fruits of the economic success currently filling the coffers of the Department of Finance are wisely used to improve our social conditions. Ensuring that the elderly are provided with high quality, comprehensive medical care is one of these priorities and I and the Labour Party are determined to see this policy put into practice. The changes the Minister announced in the budget were a positive step in this direction and I welcome his initiative. Health care is high on the agenda of older people. Access to health care and the affordability of that care are their key concerns. Every Member is aware of elderly people who postpone important medical appointments because of the substantial costs involved. This is a scandal.</P>
      <P>Last December the Minister for Finance announced that major changes to the medical card income guidelines for people over 70 years of age would be introduced. The three year reform package would steadily increase the income limits for persons over 70 years of age starting from 1 March this year. The changes would see an additional 10,000 elderly people entitled to the medical card and receiving free, comprehensive health care. This was a progressive move on the Minister's part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, major opposition to the Government's proposals has emerged, chiefly among the <Col N="119" /> medical professionals. Legitimate concerns have been raised by general practitioners. GPs who face the prospect of losing patients to the GMS scheme have sound reasons for objecting to the manner in which the extension of the medical card scheme has been carried out, the effect it will have on their patients and the implications for their own practices. GPs who would be expected to take on the additional 10,000 people who will receive medical cards under the new arrangements are concerned about how they are expected to cope.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the Government has allowed this situation to escalate to the point where a number of doctors are now considering taking legal action under the Competition Act. It appears that the Government is in danger of presiding over a fiasco and that the proposed extension of the medical card to people over 70 is now in jeopardy. Having raised the hopes of thousands of people in December, the Government, through its own incompetence, is about to fail them. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It appears that neither the Minister for Health and Children nor his colleague, the Minister for Finance, engaged in detailed consultation with the medical profession in advance of the Budget Statement last December. Will the Minister outline the steps his Department will take in the next three weeks to ensure that the issues at the heart of this dispute are resolved? In seeking a resolution of this dispute, patient care and the inclusion of the additional 10,000 people entitled to medical cards from 1 March must be at the top of everybody's agenda. Nothing less will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>In this respect, is it wise for the Minister to require people who are over 70 years of age to change their general practitioner? Many elderly people have formed a unique bond of trust with their general practitioners over a long number of years and the disruption of this relationship will cause them extreme concern. With this in mind, there is an opportunity for the Minister to negotiate a settlement that will satisfy the concerns of general practitioners and, most importantly, the concerns of older people who expect to receive the medical card on 1 March.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this issue seriously and ensure that by 1 March these people will receive their medical cards and that the other issues are resolved in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to this debate by making some observations, both general and specific, about the development of general practice in Ireland in recent years and the particular issue of extending the income limits for medical card eligibility for the over 70s which is effective from 1 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent years have seen significant investment by the State in general practice through the general practice development fund and the GP capi<Col N="120" /> tal fund. Substantial investment funds have also been made available under the indicative drugs target savings scheme and I wish to acknowledge the role the IMO played in promoting the merits of that scheme among its members.</P>
    <P>General practitioners have also benefited in terms of increased fees and allowances, in particular under last year's PCW agreement. Apart from fees and allowances, that agreement also dealt with a number of other matters of considerable benefit to general practitioners, including out of hours payments for periods outside 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday; a revised banding structure for allowances payable in respect of practice nurses and secretaries; funding to alleviate one-in-one rotas; a new scheme and allowance for GP trainers and a reduction in panel size arrangements for the recruitment of partners and/or assistants-with-a-view. This year, 1999, also saw a substantial increase in the pensions entitlements of retired former permanent district medical officers.</P>
    <P>All this is in keeping with the priority and profile the Government, Minister and Department attach to developing and sustaining a successful general practice infrastructure. It is the Minister's intention to continue to build on what has been achieved to date in further developing this pivotal area of primary care. Plans are already under way, for example, to pilot a major national computer training project for general practitioners.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the specific matter of extending the eligibility limits for the over 70s. There are a number of points I wish to make. First, the extension is wholly in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government. Second, the decision to increase the limits was made by Government in the context of the budget last December. Third, there have been claims in the press that the Department has not responded to requests for a meeting on this issue with the Irish Medical Organisation and that this refusal has meant that undue pressure has now arisen to resolve points of contention raised by the IMO before 1 March.</P>
    <P>That is not the case. The IMO request for a meeting on this issue was immediately acceded to. At that meeting, which took place last week, the IMO put forward several matters for consideration which they regard as relevant to addressing the interests of their members. Officials in the Department undertook to examine the points raised and a second meeting is scheduled for this Thursday. Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, at this time, to go into detail on the specifics of the points raised at these meetings. Conducting industrial relations negotiations by media speculation and innuendo may be thought to have some merits but it is not the best way to resolve matters of concern.</P>
    <P>I wish, however, to make the following general points. The increase in the eligibility limits is being phased in over a three year period. In that regard, it is worth noting that just under 80 per <Col N="121" /> cent of persons over the age of 70 &ndash; about 229,000 &ndash; already have medical cards. Moreover, it is difficult to estimate precisely the actual effect that the increase in the income limits will have on bringing more persons within the scheme over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The past few years have seen a substantial increase in the total number of private patients coming into the general practice system as a result of the economic boom we continue to experience. On balance, it is reasonable to presume that our continuing strong economic performance will mean that general practitioners will see more private patients come into the system than medical card holders created as a result of the over 70s income increase. Consequently, the actual economic effect, if any, of the income limit changes for GPs may well be minimal.</P>
    <P>In addition, the issue of the so-called excluded doctors, that is, non-GMS doctors, has also featured prominently in the context of the scheduled income limit increase for the over 70s. It is argued that such doctors will be particularly affected by the loss of some elderly private patients who stand to benefit from the increased income limits. That matter, and a number of others, is already being examined in a more general sense under the auspices of a working group set up last year to examine the matter of GP entry to the GMS generally.</P>
    <P>The group, comprising representatives from the Department, the health boards, the GMS (Payments) Board and the IMO, has met on a number of occasions to date and I expect that it will conclude its deliberations on this important matter in the near future. It is more appropriate that the group should be allowed to deal with the entry matter in a comprehensive way rather than attempting the more piecemeal approach of dealing with it in the context of the over 70s issue.</P>
    <P>It is regretted that the extension of the income limits for the over 70s appears to have generated the adverse attention it has, particularly since as a matter of principle it has so much to recommend it. Further discussions are scheduled on this subject between the Department and IMO for Thursday and I do not propose to comment further now on what the outcome of those discussions might be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my gratitude to the staff in the Ceann Comhairle's office for their assistance in getting this matter on to the Adjournment. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond on behalf of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unfair disadvantage is currently being perpetrated on pupils in Gaeltacht national schools which is hindering their educational progress, and it is in the gift of the Minister and the Department to resolve this matter. I welcome the Minister's commitment to reduce pupil-teacher ratio levels overall, although I acknowledge that during <Col N="122" /> his tenure to date he has been a breath of fresh air in the Department of Education and Science. I hope he will see the logic of what I am trying to achieve in this Adjournment debate.</P>
    <P>The most advantageous primary school, from the point of view of the pupil-teacher ratio, any pupil can attend is a gaelscoil. Given the primary position the Irish language holds under the Constitution, it is laudable and understandable that the State should manifest that by having a low pupil-teacher ratio in these schools. However, it should not be a case of gaelscoileanna <i>versus</i> the other schools. There are three categories of primary schools and the schools for which I want to make a case tonight are Gaeltacht primary schools. These schools are at a particular disadvantage and I will briefly outline the reason.</P>
    <P>In any individual class in a Gaeltacht national school there are three types of students in terms of their familiarity with the Irish language. That poses serious difficulties both for the pupils and the teachers. Obviously in the Gaeltacht region there are pupils who use the Irish language as their mother tongue and whose parents are anxious that they be educated almost exclusively through the medium of Irish. Then there are what might be described as the majority of pupils, even in Gaeltacht areas, who are doing their best to appreciate the Irish language and whose teachers are attempting to inculcate an appreciation of the language and its traditions but for whom it is not their primary tongue.</P>
    <P>Increasingly also in Gaeltacht areas there is a significant and growing non-national population which does not have any familiarity with the Irish language, and that poses a serious difficulty for any teacher. It must be remembered that there may be three of four different classes in many of these classrooms, and to convey any message in any subject in the primary school curriculum to pupils who are at various levels in terms of their comprehension of the Irish language makes it difficult for both the pupil and the teacher.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to acknowledge this difficulty. I have raised this matter with the Minister by way of Dáil question, unfortunately without success. I ask him to move some way towards recognising the problem in a tangible way by reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in these schools. I note the commitment to reducing the ratio overall but this could be an interim step in achieving the ultimate objective of having the same pupil-teacher ratio that exists in gaelscoileanna in all schools. There is no doubt about the case in terms of the disadvantage pupils and teachers labour under in these classrooms in trying to get their message across.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department to move in the direction of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio overall but to use the Gaeltacht primary schools as an intermediary step and to do that as soon as possible to end this educational disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to <Col N="123" /> have an opportunity to address this House on primary schools which operate in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>At the outset I must acknowledge that gaelscoileanna enjoy a more favourable overall pupil-teacher ratio than that which applies in all other mainstream primary schools, including those that operate within Gaeltacht areas. The rationale for this lies in the desire to cultivate and rejuvenate the Irish language in Irish society. Clearly, the fulfilment of this task is infinitely more achievable in Gaeltacht communities. Due to a combination of factors, including an historical attachment to the Irish language, an inherent sense of cultural identity derived from speaking the native tongue as well as a sheer delight in conversing in fluent Irish, this has ensured that the Irish language is thriving in these communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the attachment of Irish people to the Irish language is not in doubt, unfortunately the same impetus does not always exist in non-Gaeltacht communities. However, the gaelscoileanna movement has presented an opportunity for the proliferation of the Irish language among non-Gaeltacht communities. This opportunity must be seized so that every citizen will be able to learn in an all Irish environment. Accordingly it is fit<Col N="124" /> ting that incentives such as a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio are offered to gaelscoileanna to assist in strengthening and developing the spread of the Irish language among non-Gaeltacht communities.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio generally, I assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio. The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has been significantly reduced in recent years and now stands at 21.2. This has been achieved mainly through the annual retention of the demographic dividend.</P>
    <P>From the start of the 1999-2000 school year, in addition to retaining the demographic dividend in primary schools the Government has sanctioned the creation of a further 225 new posts in the primary schools. These additional posts will result in a further substantial reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>These moves clearly indicate the importance the Government attributes to education and demonstrate its commitment to seriously addressing the issue of teaching resources available in our schools.</P>
    <P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 386 together.</P>
      <P>The latest tender procedure for the development of a National Conference Centre in Dublin, with EU assistance of up to 33 million ECU under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, was organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the independent management board for product development.</P>
      <P>The procedure was conducted under the terms of EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC and Bord Fáilte-led evaluation teams undertook detailed assessments of full tender submissions which were received from five consortia. The management board concluded that the tenders submitted were not such as to enable it to make a recommendation and the process then proceeded to the negotiated procedure stage provided for in Article 7 of the EU Directive. This was conducted by an independent team of technical experts, specially appointed for the purpose by Bord Fáilte. On consideration of their findings, and following a positive recommendation by the board of Bord Fáilte, the management board decided on the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited to develop the project at a site in Dublin Docklands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Operational Programme, decisions on grant applications in respect of amounts at or above 15 million ECU (productive investments) must be made with the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community Law. This cost-benefit analysis, which was favourable towards the project, was undertaken by independent consultants and on 16 September 1998 the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the EU Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ECU grant towards the cost of developing the project. The final decision of the Commission, which is also concluding its examination of a complaint lodged with it on the tender procedures under the Public Procurement process, is awaited on the project. All queries raised have been responded to through correspondence and, most recently, at a <Col N="126" /> meeting between Bord Fáilte, the management board and Commission officials.</P>
    <P>The developers are still working towards a timeframe of 31 December 2000 for completion of the project, should an early and favourable outcome from the Commission's deliberations on the project be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, decided last year to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.</P>
      <P>The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. A project team was established by the Department to assist with the preparation of invitation to tender documentation and to oversee the tendering process. This team comprises representatives of a number of Government Departments and other organisations.</P>
      <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The Department requested developers to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers were required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000, towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
      <P>The deadline for submission of full tenders from qualified candidates was 27 November 1998, and three tender proposals were received on that date. Two tender proposals were deemed to have met the qualification criteria by the project team, which is overseeing the tender process with the assistance of independent professional consultants, and these proposals have proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on 18 January 1999, the other tenderer applied for and was given leave by the High Court seeking to have their disqualification set <Col N="127" /> aside, and their tender considered. These proceedings are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the detailed evaluation of the two remaining tenders is continuing, and interviews with the tenderers were held on Thursday, 21 January. The evaluation is being undertaken by an independent multi-disciplinary consultancy team who will produce a full technical assessment and evaluation report for the project team which is overseeing the project. The team will then report its findings and recommendations, following which I will present a Memorandum to the Government on the matter. A final decision and public announcement on the outcome are anticipated in February-March. Such a timetable is conditional, however, on the outcome of the High Court case.</P>

      <P>The various options for the future funding of tourism destination marketing were set out in detail in my Department's discussion paper, Strategy for Tourism in the context of EU Structural Funding 2000-2006. In that paper it was proposed that a tourism marketing fund would be established and it was suggested that this could be financed through a combination of financing from the EU, the industry and the State, with an enhanced level of partnership between the key players.</P>
      <P>Since the preparation of this document last year, my Department has been engaged in a consultation process with the industry, through the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation which examined funding and institutional options in their planning document entitled Strategy for Growth beyond 2000.</P>
      <P>I share the industry's objective of ensuring that a substantial marketing fund for Irish tourism will be in place for the new Millennium. Ireland's performance in a growing but hugely competitive international marketplace has been excellent over the past decade with ambitious targets for foreign earnings and for visitor numbers consistently being achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under two EU co-funded operational programmes for tourism, covering the period 1989-1999, the State, in partnership with the industry, has made excellent use of Structural Funds in marketing Ireland as a tourism destination abroad. My Department is making a strong and persuasive case for continued EU funding under the next round. However, the outcome of negotiations on future Structural funding for Ireland and the subsequent allocation of that funding <Col N="128" /> between individual economic sectors, will not be known for some time yet. Given the uncertainty over the timing of decisions on future EU funding, the introduction of a modest visitor levy is one of the options being considered by my Department, in consultation with ITIC, as a possible mechanism to contribute to the future financing of tourism marketing.</P>
    <P>The Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, OTMI, which was established under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, has proven to be a very worthwhile initiative involving the tourism industry, North and South, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in the marketing of the island as a whole. I am confident that under the new institutional arrangements envisaged under the British-Irish Agreement, such all island tourism marketing co-operation will be further developed in the future. It is too early to say what precise partnership arrangements with the industry will be put in place for the year 2000 onwards. However, I will strive to ensure that the industry will continue to play an important role in partnership with the appropriate State institutions.</P>

      <P>I have not had any direct contacts with the Interational Olympic Committee regarding the drug testing of professional athletes. However, I attended the Olympic Council of Ireland's Seminar on Sport against Drugs in November 1998 at which many leading experts in the field of drug taking in sport, including IOC representatives, were present. At the conference I outlined my strong views on the issue of doping in sport and gave details of the Governments National Sports Anti-Doping Programme.</P>
      <P>Minister of State at my Department Deputy Flood, recently attended, on my behalf, an informal meeting of European Union Sports Ministers in Bonn to discuss doping in sport. The meeting was specifically called to prepare for the International Olympic Committee World Conference on Doping in Sport which took place in Lausanne from 2-4 February 1998. The Ministers agreed to set up an EU working group of officials to improve the co-ordination of existing national measures and the EU approach on the subject of doping in sport. It was also agreed that a unified approach to tackling the doping issue would be presented by EU Government representatives at the IOC Conference in Lausanne.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, with the implementation of the central recommendations of the AD Little review of Bord Fáilte, the board is now free to devote even more attention to the defining role of promoting and marketing Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Late last year, the board of Bord Fáilte endorsed a revised senior management structure for the organisation. The board stress that this structural revision is underpinned by a strategic review process which they currently have under way which is intended to ensure that board best placed to serve the needs of the industry in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Tourism industry practitioners also have a vital role in marketing their own products and services, whether as part of a co-operative marketing group, or independently, and thereby contributing to promoting Ireland as a tourism destination.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that the marketing efforts of the private sector largely complement those of the State and in generating ongoing growth in tourist demand for their individual services, have contributed in no small way to the outstanding success of Irish tourism in general over the past decade.</P>

      <P>The selection of Irish athletes to compete in the Sydney Olympic Games is a matter for the Olympic Council of Ireland in consultation with the relevant National Governing Bodies of Sport. Funding has already been provided in 1998 to the Council specifically to assist with the costs of its preparations for participation by Ireland in the 2000 Olympics.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategic plans for the development of high performance sport include the provision of substantial funding in 1998 and 1999 to the national governing bodies of sport to improve their operational and technical capabilities and assist with their international training and competition programmes which are aimed primarily at preparing teams to compete successfully at the highest level including the Olympic Games in Sydney. In addition, under the new international carding scheme launched in May 1998, many of Ireland's high performance players and athletes who have embarked on qualification for the Sydney Games have received individual grants to help meet any additional necessary international competition and training expenses.</P>
      <P>The carding scheme also provides access to a full range of specified back up services which include sports science and medical support, career planning and counselling and training facilities. Funding in excess of £960,000 was allocated in 1998 in respect of individual grants under the scheme. Application forms and details of the 1999 scheme are due to issue to the national governing bodies of sport shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 73 and 385 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national <Col N="131" /> 50 metre swimming pool, decided last year to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.</P>
    <P>The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. A project team was established by the Department to assist with the preparation of invitation to tender documentation and to oversee the tendering process. This team comprises representatives of a number of Government Departments and other organisations.</P>
    <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors. The Department requested developers to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers were required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000, towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
    <P>The deadline for submission of full tenders from qualified candidates was 27 November 1998, and three tender proposals were received on that date. Two tender proposals were deemed to have met the qualification criteria by the project team, which is overseeing the tender process with the assistance of independent professional consultants, and these proposals have proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project.</P>
    <P>However, on 18 January 1999 the other tenderer applied for and was given leave by the High Court seeking to have their disqualification set aside, and their tender considered. These proceedings are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the detailed evaluation of the two remaining tenders is continuing, and interviews with the tenderers were held on Thursday, 21 January. The evaluation is being undertaken by an independent multi-disciplinary consultancy team who will produce a full technical assessment and evaluation report for the project team which is overseeing the project. The team will then report its findings and recommendations, following which I will present a Memorandum to the Government on the matter. A final decision and public announcement on the outcome are anticipated in February-March. Such a timetable is conditional, however, on the outcome of the High Court case.</P>

      <P>An external evaluation of the drugs initiative was completed late last year, and its report was considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The evaluation found that the task forces had achieved a number of significant successes in the short time since they were established.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendations in the report, the Cabinet Committee agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being, to facilitate the putting in place of an evaluation framework which would include clear statements of the overall aim of the initiative, the specific objectives arising from this aim and the specific targets arising from these objectives, quantified where possible; and appropriate macro-level monitoring arrangements to allow performance against stated objectives and targets to be measured.</P>
      <P>A full review of the local drugs task forces, having regard to the findings and recommendations of the evaluation, is expected to start shortly, with a view to submitting a detailed response to the Cabinet Committee at an early date. This will pave the way for a comprehensive, in-depth review of the overall National Drugs Strategy, on which work is expected to begin later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 75 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.</P>
      <P>To that end, the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>The first phase of that project involved a close look at the situation on the ground in four areas &ndash; Dublin's North East Inner City, the Canal Communities &ndash; Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Garden, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House &ndash; Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork. The outcome strongly suggests the value of closer working and planning relationships between the organisations from the State-funded sector which are active in deprived urban areas. It also indicates the value of taking account of the real needs and experience of end-users in the design and planning of service delivery in those areas.</P>
      <P>Following a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the implementation phase of the project was launched by the Taoiseach on 4 December last at a special meeting of Secretaries General of relevant Departments and chief executive officers of relevant statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee has given me responsibility for overseeing arrangements for the implementarion of the project. Each relevant Government Department and statutory agency has been asked to designate an official at national level, and also for each of the target areas, who will be responsible for driving the integrated services process within that Department or agency.</P>
      <P>All such persons designated at local level will be asked to come together to examine the needs of each area and how best to address them, as a team. They will be assisted in this process by a national co-ordinator based in ADM Limited, which is looking after operational aspects of the project, and by four development and monitoring officers, one of whom will be based in each of the tartet areas. Candidates have been selected for these posts by open competition and will be in position before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The whole drive towards a more integrated approach to the design and delivery of State services does have significant implications for Departments and agencies, each of whom have been asked to address a number of generic issues relevant to the development of a more integrated, community-informed modus operandi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participating Departments and agencies have also been requested to examine, as a matter of urgency, a number of suggestions for local action <Col N="134" /> which emerged in the initial stages of the project. The process of examination is under way throughout Departments and I would hope to see it completed by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The work done in relation to the target areas during the research phase was co-ordinated by ADM Limited with a good input from community representatives and front-line workers. It was designed to give some feeling for the sort of issues which need to be tackled in order to secure a more integrated appproach. It generated a series of suggestions about possible local actions which are now being examined. It has given us a baseline from which to work. It was never my intention to have that work formally published.</P>
    <P>However, as I appreciate the support and interest which Deputies from all sides have in the success of this project, I would be prepared to make a copy available to any Deputy who wishes to have a copy of this research work.</P>
    <P>Up to £500,000 is being made available from my Department's Vote this year for overall administration and salary expenses in respect of the project, which, I should stress is about the integration and enhancement of the delivery of State services and is not a capital grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Funding of specific local or sectoral actions will be the responsibility of the relevant mainline Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>Currently, funding to Bord Lúthchleas Ógánach na hÉireann is channelled through Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann, BLE, while funding to the Irish Schools Athletic Association, ISAA, has been allocated separately to that organisation. I have stated that my policy in relation to the funding for athletics is to reach a situation quickly where development funds for the sport can be channelled through one administrative structure.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, as an initial step in this process, I asked BLE, the ISAA and the other recognised governing body for athletics, the National Cultural and Athletic Association of Ireland, NACAI, to participate in a joint planning group to be chaired by the Director of the National Coaching and Training Centre to facilitate the preparation of an integrated application for funding towards the cost of organisational development, international competition and training and hosting of events in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While applications for funding for purposes other than those I have outlined will be accepted from the three organisations individually, I hope <Col N="135" /> that, by the year 2001, one administration budget can be provided for the athletics sector. I am heartened by recent public statements made by the respective organisations expressing a positive approach to unity.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, has met on 12 occasions. As far as my area of responsibility is concerned it has considered matters relating to the National Drugs Strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund and the integrated services project.</P>
      <P>Following a recent independent evaluation of the drugs initiative, the Cabinet Committee has agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces in the medium term, on the basis of an appropriate framework being put in place which would enable the initiative to be measured in terms of outcomes and impacts in due course. The evaluator, in finding that a number of significant successes had been achieved in the relatively short time since they were established, had recommended that the local drugs task forces should continue, to see if the encouraging progress made to date can be translated into longer term, quantifiable and sustainable benefits on the ground.</P>
      <P>I am preparing detailed proposals on the future operation of the task forces &ndash; in the light of the findings and recommendations of the evaluator &ndash; and I will submit these to the Cabinet Committee for consideration at an early date.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the task forces are continuing to implement their action plans, which contain nearly 230 separate measures under the themes of education, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and reducing local supply and for which the Government have allocated £10 million funding.</P>
      <P>Under a separate, complementary initiative, the Government last year set up young people's facilities and services fund. The purpose of the fund is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the Exchequer contribution of £30 million committed to the fund over the period 1998-2000, to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects, £20 million is being targeted at the local drugs task force areas. Development groups &ndash;<Col N="136" /> comprising representatives from the task forces, local authorities and vocational education committees &ndash; were set up in these areas and they have prepared integrated facilities and services plans. These plans are being assessed by an inter-agency committee, chaired by my Department, with a view to making recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the near future, regarding funding to implement them.</P>
    <P>The remaining £10 million has been allocated by the Cabinet Committee to support strategies and projects aimed at young people and children at risk, including those at risk of drug misuse, in other major urban centres.</P>
    <P>One of committee's priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severly disadvantaged urban communities. That is being addressed by the pilot integrated services project with which the House is familiar.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Charter governs the organisation and operation of the olympic movement and stipulates the conditions for the celebration of the Olympic Games. Under the charter, the International Olympic Committee is the supreme authority of the olympic movement. Any proposals for the reform of the olympic movement in the light of recent events would be a matter for the members of the International Olympic Committee, which is a private and autonomous body, and of which the Irish Olympic Council is a constituent part. Therefore I have not considered it appropriate to make public comment on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the recent events, I would be concerned that some members of the International Olympic Committee may have acted in a manner not in keeping with one of the fundamental principles of the olympic movement which states that sport should be practised without discrimination of any kind and in a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play. I understand from press reports that preliminary investigations carried out by the International Olympic Committee into recent allegations have resulted in the resignations of some IOC members. The reports have also con<Col N="137" /> firmed that investigations are continuing into the actions of other members suspected of improprieties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mininster of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its two reports, the ministerial task force made a series of recommendations across a range of areas to address the problem of the demand for drugs, including the establishment of structures at national and local level to co-ordinate a response to the drug problem. As the Deputy will be aware, a Cabinet Drugs Committee, the National Drugs Strategy team and thirteen local drugs task forces were set up arising out of those recommendations. </P>
      <P>The National Drugs Strategy team comprises representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, along with two persons who bring the perspectives of the voluntary and community sectors to its work. The team's brief is to ensure effective co-ordination between Departments and agencies in implementing the Government's drugs initiative, as well as monitoring developments at local level, ensuring that the problems and priorities of local communities are being addressed by central Government.</P>
      <P>Local drugs task forces were set up in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug  misuse to: develop and implement an integrated response to the drug problem in those areas; and involve local communities in the planning, design and implementation of that response.</P>
      <P>On assuming office, the Government, recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, decided to re-constitute the Cabinet Drugs Committee into a wider Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, which would address disadvantage in the broadest sense. This committee seeks to pull together the various strategies to combat social exclusion &ndash; and resultant problems such as drug misuse &ndash; into a co-ordinated, targeted response.</P>
      <P>The task forces have prepared action plans, focusing on the development of community based initiatives to link in with and add value to existing or planned drug programmes and services. The Government has allocated £10 million to support implementation of the approved plans which contains nearly 230 separate projects, approximately 80 per cent of which have, or are, drawing down funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Followning a recent independent evaluation of the initiative, the Cabinet Committee on Social <Col N="138" /> Inclusion has agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being, on the basis of an appropriate framework being put in place which would enable the initiative to be measured in terms of outcomes and impacts in due course.</P>
    <P>Under a separate, complementary initiative, the Government has set up a young people's facilities and services fund and committed £30 million in Exchequer funding over the period 1998-2000. The purpose of this fund is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreation facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
    <P>Of this Exchequer contribution, £20 million is being targeted at the local drugs task force areas for which integrated facilities and services plans have been prepared for consideration shortly by the Cabinet Committee.</P>

      <P>The Government has already, in November, 1997, approved grant assistance, up to a maximum of £5 million, towards the cost of holding the Special Olympics World Summer Games, 2003 in Ireland, should the bid to secure them be successful.</P>
      <P>When the bid site selection team visited Ireland in April last to assess Ireland's capability to host the Games in 2003, I hosted a reception in DVBLINIA and a breakfast in Government Buildings which gave the team an opportunity to assess the enthusiasm already generated among the business community for the games and to be assured of the Government's support for the bid.</P>
      <P>In October last I informed the House that Special Olympics International had asked that Special Olympics Ireland obtain a written statement from the Irish Government that half of the £5 million grant be converted into an unconditional guarantee of £2.5 million against potential financial loss by the 2003 Games Organising Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been impossible for the Government to issue an unconditional guarantee that it would undertake to underwrite any debts arising from the holding of the World Games. However, the Minister for Finance decided, in order to enable the games organising committee step up <Col N="139" /> the momentum of its fund-raising efforts and to leverage financial backing on the scale required from other sources by end-1999, that the allocation for the games in the 1999 Estimates should be increased from £250,000 to £2.5 million, in lieu of a State guarantee, within the maximum grant of £5 million. The new allocation will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume for 1999. This development was noted by the Government and Special Olympics Ireland was informed of the decision in November last.</P>
    <P>A final decision by Special Olympics Ireland on the location of the 2003 Special Olympics Summers Games is awaited.</P>

      <P>The swimming pool programme provides capital grants towards the cost of refurbishing existing swimming pools and towards the cost of new pools. Under this programme 23 swimming pools were refurbished over the last ten years, while work is in progress at a further three existing pools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government allocated £10 million to support the implementation of nearly 230 separate initiatives in action plans prepared by the local drugs task force which were set up to develop and implement an integrated response to the drugs problem in their areas and involve local communities in the planning, design and implementation of that response.</P>
      <P>Funding for this initiative is held in the Vote of my Department and is transferred, on request as projects become operational, to other Departments and agencies, which are acting as channels of funding to the approved projects. Approximately £5.6 million has been drawn down by these Departments and agencies to date and around 80 per cent of the projects are drawing down funding.</P>
      <P>An important feature of the initiative is the engagement of local communities in the design and planning of strategies to respond to the drugs problem in their areas and in the implementation of approved projects. In the majority of cases, this has been undertaken by voluntary and community groups, in partnership with relevant statutory agencies and assisted by the local drugs task forces. It is hoped that this approach will assist the viability and sustainability of these projects and facilitate their future mainstreaming. However, a vital prerequisite to achieving this is the need to develop the capacity of community and voluntary organisations to deliver locally-based drug programmes and services.</P>
      <P>In the task force areas where strong community structures were in place prior to the setting up of the initiative, the emphasis in the action plan was on developing and expanding those structures. Accordingly, in such areas, it was possible to get the majority of approved projects up and running relatively quickly. It is notable that these areas either had a long tradition of community involvement in responding to the drugs problem or had a local partnership company which had established a strong community network in the area. Conversely, in the areas where community networks were less developed, the emphasis in the plans was on building up these structures and, as a result, it has taken longer to get projects off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four principal features which have impacted on the speed at which projects are being established are the fact that they are designed to address gaps in current service provisions, which means that, in many instances, they have had to be designed and planned from scratch; in many instances, appropriate local management structures have had to be put in place as a prerequisite to ensuring the projects will work effectively, meet their objectives and are sustainable with a view to their future mainstreaming; the lack of suitable infrastructure or premises from which programmes and services could be run and, in a number of instances, local opposition to such services, due to a misunderstanding as to their pur<Col N="141" /> pose, which is to provide backup and support to the care and after-care services being provided by the health board; and the shortage of appropriately trained personnel to deliver drug programmes and services and the potential competition this can cause between projects.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces, the Department and agencies acting as channels of funding and the national drug strategy team all play an important role in ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring of the approved projects. The task forces assist in the planning and design of the projects and submit regular reports to the national drug strategy team on progress in their implementation. The team members and the statutory representatives on the task forces are making every effort to assist the projects in overcoming problems or difficulties inhibiting the start-up of projects being funded through their Departments or agencies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Swim Ireland was launched as a special annual general meeting of the former Irish Amateur Swimming Association, which was held on 24 January. The AGM was brought forward, at my request, so that the necessary restructuring of that association could be effected as quickly. I understand the meeting was a difficult one but I also realise that significant change could not be achieved without a full and frank review of past events. While this may have been a painful exercise for the association, it was important for the delegates to make their views known.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the meeting was that the IASA be wound up and a new body &ndash; Swim Ireland &ndash; be put in place. The memorandum and articles of association for the new body have been passed and an interim executive is in place until the annual general meeting of the organisation, which is scheduled for 24 April.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I approved a grant of £30,000 to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association solely for the purpose of bringing forward the AGM from April to January. This sum was a contribution towards the legal and administrative costs of bringing forward the AGM and the creation of a database of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be in a position to consider an application for funding from the new body until the <Col N="142" /> new executive has been appointed in a democratic manner and until I am satisfied that procedures and arrangements relating to the safety of the younger members have been agreed by the wider membership. Accordingly, I encourage all members of the new body, constituent clubs, and affiliates to participate wholeheartedly in the preparation for, and the conduct of, the upcoming AGM to ensure this objective is achieved and confidence in the organisation of the sport is restored.</P>

      <P>URBAN is a Community initiative of the European Commission under which assistance is made available for integrated development programmes for a limited number of geographically defined deprived urban areas throughout the EU, irrespective of whether these areas are located in Objective One regions or otherwise. The question of Objective One status, or otherwise, for Ireland, arising from the regionalisation proposals submitted by the Government will not, therefore, have any bearing on future of the URBAN initiaive. Although the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals do not contemplate the continuance of the URBAN initiative after 1999, the Government is pressing for its retention, and is pursuing this objective in the context of the overall Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>

      <P>Toward the end of 1998, I met a number of multiples to discuss the growing concern among consumers at the perceived failure of the retail trade to reduce the price of meat on the shelves to reflect the historically low prices paid to farmers. I made it clear to the multiples that the Government is particularly concerned about consumer perceptions of unnecessarily high meat prices on supermarket shelves. Profiteering at any point in the supply chain, either at retail level or at the processing stage, would be wholly unacceptable to me as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs. I also made it clear that the multiples must move quickly to restore consumer confidence in the value they are getting for meat and demonstrate clearly that they are pushing prices down.</P>
      <P>The multiples maintained, in general, that any reductions in the prices which they pay to processors have been reflected in their retail prices and the most recent CSO data indicate that some of the reductions in farm producer prices have been passed on to consumers. I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
      <P>As regards price control generally, it is Government policy to encourage competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers. I have drawn the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement to a debate in this House on the issue of food prices &ndash; 7 October 1998 &ndash; and I have asked him to take such action as he considers appropriate.</P>

      <P>Job initiative is a work reintegration programme targeted at the long-term unemployed, persons on the live register for five years or more and aged 35 or over. Job initiative participants have access to three years temporary employment. The 1999 budget added an additional 875 places to job initiative, bringing the total number of places available to 2,875.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> The first 1,000 job initiative participants are in the third and final year of their programme.

It would be contrary to the labour market reintegration focus of the programme and unfair to other potential participants in the programme to do otherwise. FÁS will apply this guideline nationally.</P>
    <P>I understand a number of participants have left the programme prior to completing three years to take up jobs in the open labour market which is an encouraging sign of the programme's efficacy and the motivation of participants.

      <Quest> the proposals, if any, she has to ensure that funding sufficient to prevent cutbacks in or abandonment of approved projects is made available by the Exchequer or, as is the case in Wales, through local authorities pending the drawing down of further INTERREG funding in view of inordinate delays in the payment of funds under the INTERREG 11 Maritime (Ireland/Wales) Programme. </Quest>

      <P>The European Commission has notified the <Col N="146" /> Department that its application for funding under this programme has been accepted. The application is being processed for payment in the Commission and it is expected that funds will arrive in the Department in less than two months.</P>
      <P>Because of concern that the current Irish INTERREG projects would be cut back or abandoned due to the long payment delays referred to by the Deputy the Department had attempted to find an interim solution in this case as I indicated in reply to Question No. 172 on 27 January to Deputy Quinn. This interim solution involved the use of Exchequer funds. However, following discussion with the Department of Finance, this was not considered possible in terms of public financial procedure requirements and because, for example, of the creation of a precedent for other cases of delay in receipt of EU funding. While I am aware that pre-financing to cover delays in the receipt EU funding was provided through Welsh local authorities to their INTERREG promoters, there is no such facility available in the Irish case at this time. In the circumstances every effort will continue to be made by the Department to get the European Commission to provide the expected funding as quickly as possible and, on receipt, to pay it over to the projects with the minimum of delay.</P>

      <P>I am informed that a grant agreement existed between IDA Ireland and Ballinamore Textiles under which the company had to comply with certain conditions. One condition of the grant agreement was that if the company ceased to function the grant liability would become due. As the company closed in April 1998, IDA Ireland sought repayment of outstanding grant liabilities. It is the policy of IDA to claim any money owned under the grant liability clause which is contained in every legal agreement and the same policy was implemented with Fruit of the Loom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposal of the European Parliament and the Council on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright <Col N="147" /> and related rights in the information society. The Government welcomes this proposal in principle. The protection of intellectual property is vital for economic prosperity in the information society. In this context, the proposed directive will address the need for further harmonisation of copyright and related rights in the framework of the Internal Market in the face of the new challenges of the digital environment. The proposal is also intended to enable the European Union to adhere to the two new World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, treaties; the WIPO copyright treaty, WCT, and the WIPO performance and phonograms treaty, WPPT.</P>
      <P>The proposed directive has been the subject of discussions at Council working group level and Ireland had actively participated in these discussions. The European Parliament intends to discuss this proposal in plenary session during the week commencing 8 February 1999 and to adopt its report on same. The European Commission will subsequently consider this report and hopes to adopt its findings in this regard by early April 1999.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is in the process of preparing a new Copyright and Related Rights Bill which is designed to provide Ireland with a state-of-the-art regime of statutory protection for copyright and related rights. This new legislation will take account of Ireland's EU and international obligations, including the WCT and the WPPT, as well as technology developments. The priority issues addressed in the proposed directive in relation to the right of reproduction, right of communication to the public, technological developments and rights management information and the right of distribution of physical copies are four of the major items being examined by my Department in the context of the new Bill.</P>

      <P>Kilkenny Textile Mills, KTM, was established in Kilkenny in 1983 following the closure of Fieldcrest, the US towel <Col N="148" /> producer. KTM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Santens BV, Belgium, a family owned group engaged in the manufacture of terry towelling products.</P>
      <P>On 18 January 1999, Kilkenny Textile Mills announced that, as part of an overall restructuring plan, the company proposes to seek 40 redundancies in its spinning plant. Reducing employment to 40 will allow the plant to operate at full capacity, thus negating the need for short-time working. In this regard, the company has given assurances that the remaining jobs at the plant are secure.</P>
      <P>To date there have been no job losses at the Kilkenny plant, as the company is in negotiation with the trade unions on a redundancy package. The IDA has been in contact with FÁS with regard to a skills audit of those employees to be made redundant. FÁS has offered its services and proposes to provide interviewing facilities at the plant and training courses to the employees concerned. In addition, those who are to be made redundant will be considered for suitable job vacancies notified to FÁS.</P>

      <P>The regarding of the rank of secretary was on foot of a recommendation by an independent consultancy study of the administrative procedures in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, secretariat and was part of a package of measures introduced to improve the service provided by the tribunal. Developments of late in so far as the Employment Tribunal is concerned have been an increase in the number of tribunal members, a substantial increase in the staff of the secretariat and information technology improvements. The changes have enabled the tribunal to perform its statutory functions more efficiently and to provide a better service generally. The waiting period for cases to come to hearing before the tribunal has been considerably reduced. For example, the waiting period in Dublin is now two to three months compared to six months in 1996. In the rest of the country the waiting period has also substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal has an important role in adjudicating on employment <Col N="149" /> rights issues. The Department will continue its engagement with the development of the operational efficiency of the tribunal. During the course of the year, the Department plans to achieve a reduction in the waiting period for the issue of determinations, as well as put in place a further upgrade of the data base of determinations and to make them available to all on the Internet. The Department is also funding an ongoing review by the tribunal of pre-hearing assessments.</P>
    <P>Given the evidence of these considerable improvements and the work under way and planned, the public can be assured that its confidence in the Employment Appeal Tribunal is justified. The resources devoted to its operation and the development measures afoot testify to the high regard in which I hold the tribunal and the support which is provided to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, US reaction to changes in the European Union's banana import regime to bring it into line with World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules has been to threaten trade sanctions against certain exports from the European Union, including Ireland. The agreement reached on 29 January in the WTO in Geneva means that for the moment the US threat has been averted.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, a WTO dispute panel is examining the recently revised EU banana import regime and willl pronounce on its compatibility with WTO rules. The panel will also examine the US request for authority to impose trade sanctions and will assess the appropriateness of these under the WTO rules. It is expected that the results of the WTO panel's work will begin to become available at the beginning of next month and it is hoped that it will then be possible to resolve the matter within the mechanisms of the WTO. If these efforts prove unsuccessful the US sanctions could apply from early March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that for some exporters, particularly small exporters, in particular sectors, a loss of potential US markets could represent a serious strain on their resources. It is for this reason that every effort needs to be made to avoid trade sanctions, although the threat of such sanctions remains real. If the US action goes ahead, I estimate that Irish exports affected could be of the <Col N="150" /> order of £3 million per annum spread across a range of products. By comparison, the total amount of EU trade affected could be in excess of £400 million.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been active within the internal EU discussions and the broader Geneva discussions in working towards a resolution of the dispute within the dispute settlement system of the WTO. I consider it important that this system, the cornerstone of the WTO, is not undermined by unilateral sanctions action. Enormous effort has been invested in building the WTO which provides a stable global trading environment. Unilateral action to resolve trade disputes endangers this environment and the economic benefits which derive from it.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to ensure the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and Irish suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so. In that context my Department is facilitating discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing. I am anxious that Irish involvement be increased and sustained over the longer term. There are, however, no powers available to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services with the oil companies involved in offshore exploration activities. Responsibility as regards employment of workers and the provison of services and related issues are strictly matters for the exploration companies and their contractors. There are no powers available to oblige operators engaged in exploration activities in the Irish offshore to use Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services. The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration activities. It has been active in this area for some time and has assisted operators in identifying <Col N="151" /> Irish companies which can tender for work and assisted companies by identifying opportunities arising in petroleum exploration and production.</P>

      <P>I remain concerned at the human rights situation in Algeria. In the context of the framework for preparations for the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which commences in Geneva on March 22, we will be discussing the situation in Algeria with our EU partners. We will also be liaising closely with other states which share our concerns on human rights abuses in Algeria. In the process of developing our position we will be looking into a number of options, including those put forward by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the scale of the unrest has abated and there appears to be slight amelioration in the overall security situation in Algeria, reports show that massacres and bombings are still being perpetrated. There are repeated accounts of basis human rights violations. I have used every possible opportunity to convey to the Algerian authorities our concerns about the situation there. Last month our ambassador specifically raised the questions of torture and disappearances in his meetings with President Zeroual and the Foreign Minister. Similar concerns have been expressed <Col N="152" /> by the European Union on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>It remains essential that Algeria works with the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. The Algerian authorities have made it clear, however, that they are not prepared to accept UN special rapporteurs for torture and extrajudicial executions. The Government and our EU partners intend to maintain pressure on the Algerian authorities to accept the UN special rapporteurs, and will continue to work to achieve a greater degree of co-operation between Algeria and the United Nations.</P>

      <P>The human rights situation in Burma continues to be a cause of serious concern to the Government. This is reflected in Ireland's strong support for the common position on Burma adopted by the European Union over two years ago and which was further strengthened at the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 26 October last year.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Japan has resumed its humanitarian aid programme to Burma in recent years. Particular concern has been expressed internationally at a yen loan, equivalent to approximately £15 million, granted by the Japanese Government last March for the refurbishment of safety facilities at Rangoon International Airport. It is understood, however, that this and other assistance offered by Japan has been provided only in relation to projects which are classified by the Japanese Government as being of a humanitarian or emergency nature.</P>

I shall also continue to work with my EU colleagues for an improvement in the civil and political liberties of the Burmese people and shall endeavour to provide whatever practical assistance may be feasible to the democratic opposition movement in that country.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that his Department can provide meaningful explanations for the proposal to limit the second stage of the competition for the supply of armoured personnel carriers to two companies particularly having regard to the worldwide reputation and track record of those companies which it is proposed to exclude from the second stage, the need to clearly demonstrate that value for money will be assured if only two companies tender and to be seen to comply with the highest public procurement standards internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>Defensive equipment for the Defence Forces is acquired in accordance with procedures approved by Government relating to public procurement. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders which are assessed on the basis of obtaining best value for money by the Department. The current competition to procure armoured personel carriers, APCs, organised by the Department, was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures the objective of which is the achievement of the highest standards of impartiality, objectivity and transparency. Tenderers were afforded equal opportunity in their submissions and in providing such further information as was necessary to ensure their proposals were fully presented to the Department.</P>
      <P>More than 30 prospective suppliers world-wide expressed interest in the APC procurement programme. They were provided with the technical specification and invited to submit proposals. Proposals were received from 12 companies and were evaluated and assessed by a civilian-military project team which has been established to manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.</P>
      <P>Two vehicles have been selected to go forward to the next stage of the competition having complied fully with the initial technical specification in which protection of troops was given high priority. The successful proposals were submitted by Mowag of Switzerland which manufactures the Piranha APC and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria which manufactures the Pandur APC. The two suppliers selected will shortly be asked to prepare formal tenders on the basis of a more detailed specification. The evaluation process will include trials in Ireland of both vehicles by the Defence Forces. The aim of these trials will be to assess from a technical and user perspective the suitability of the vehicles against agreed criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ten firms which were unsuccessful in the first part of the competition were notified as to the areas of non-compliance by their vehicles with essential elements of the specification. Representations were made by three of these firms <Col N="155" /> regarding aspects of their proposals which they felt the project team had not fully appreciated. The letters were fully considered and detailed responses were issued last month.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that a contract will be in place later this year for the supply of up to 40 APCs over five years, with the first APC expected to be delivered next year.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan, 1996 to 1998, which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the reserve to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. In November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the chief of staff had established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. The membership of the joint civilian-military steering group comprises an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from my Department and a serving FCA Officer.</P>
      <P>Although I have not specified deadlines in the terms of reference of the steering group for the submission of an interim or final report, the steering group submitted an interim report on 30 July 1998. In December 1998 the military board forwarded an initial, incomplete draft of its final report to the steering group for consideration. The steering group has completed its consideration of the draft report and has conveyed its views and recommendations thereon to the military board which will, in  due course, submit its final report to the group. On conclusion of its considerations and deliberations the steering group will submit a final report to me.</P>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming payment of the pension is made from the date of receipt of a valid application. A valid application is an application accompanied by all the necessary documents indicating that all the conditions for payment have been met as approved by an authorised officer of the Minister. In this case the application was lodged in the local Farm Development Service office on 25 April 1994. However, the application could not be processed as the accompanying documentation was incomplete. The outstanding documentation was lodged on 24 June 1994 and payment was authorised from that date.</P>

      <P>The rate of pension paid to participants in the early retirement scheme was designated in ECUs up to the end of December 1998 and since that date in euros. The amount of pension payable in euros is converted to punts at the rate which was set at 1 January 1999 and this is 5.055 per cent lower than the rate at which ECUs were converted to punts for the pension scheme. As a result, pensions under the scheme have been reduced by 5.055 per cent from 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>The change in the exchange rate affected all 7,982 participants in the early retirement scheme. The total reductions in pensions payments to participants in January 1999 due to the introduction of the euro was £272,078.97.</P>
      <P>Full compensation will be payable in 1999 for the reduction in 1999 pensions to participants who joined the scheme prior to 1998. My Department is in consultation with EU Commission for clarification on the issue of compensation for participants who joined during 1998. Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid.</P>

      <P>An essential prerequisite for eligibility under the hardship grant scheme is that the herd- owner is not in receopt of off-farm income. While no application for a hardship grant has been received in the district veterinary office from the herdowner, the person named made the district veterinary office aware that she is in receipt of off-farm income which would preclude her from receiving a hardship grant payment.</P>
      <P>A total of four reactor animals have been identified to date out of an initial herd of 32 animals. Normally in the case of herds in which bovine tuberculosis has been identified a significantly higher percentage of animals would have to be identified and removed as reactors before depopulation of a herd would be considered. A veterinary inspector from the district veterinary office will discuss the situation with the herdowner.</P>

As this building was built prior to that date these regulations only apply where <Col N="178" /> material alterations, extensions or material change of purpose group are carried out. In this regard, any works carried out to the building subsequent to that date have been carried out in accordance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that this building is fitted with modern fire detection and alarm system, emergency lighting, lit evacuation signage and an automatic sprinkler system. The building is constructed to provide fire resisting, protected escape routes and is further sub-divided to provide fire resisting compartmentation. These features ensure that the building is fully code compliant with the current standards. In particular, the automatic sprinkler installation provides a higher level of fire safety than would be required for any similar building designed to current codes of practice.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the excellent work which is being carried out by hospices. However, the VAT treatment of hospices is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish law must comply. This provides that bodies like hospitals and hospices are exempt for VAT purposes. Exempt status means that, while hospices do not charge VAT on the services that they provive, they are unable to recover the VAT charged on the goods and services that they buy in the course of their activities. As a general rule, VAT is only recoverable by VAT-registered persons.</P>
      <P>In relation to VAT incurred on expenditure by the North-West Hospice, there is no provision in VAT law which would enable the VAT payable to be either refunded or waived.</P>

    <P>The latest position is that the Commission has written to my Department with several queries arising from our initial application. The reply to them is currently being prepared.

Other questions relate to the <Col N="180" /> interaction of operating aid with the new regional aid guidelines published by the Commission, including the link between the nature of the handicaps addressed by the operating aid and the nature of the aid.

      <Quest>if he will consider the case for reviewing excise duties on beer production with a view to basing these duties on levels of production by each brewery thereby providing the new microbrewers with a more equitable basis for competition with the major players in the industry (details supplied).</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish excise duties do not discriminate between large and small breweries and the tax system is not a source of competitive distortion. In addition, the excise duty on beer was last increased in the January 1994 budget. So, in effect, the industry has been advantaged by a relative decline in the share of its price which is attributed to tax.</P>
      <P>Under Article 4.1 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC, member states may apply reduced rates of duty, which may be differentiated in accordance with the annual production of the breweries concerned, to beer brewed by independent small breweries within the following limits: the reduced rates shall not be applied to undertakings producing more than 200,000 hectolitres of beer per year; and, the reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, shall not be set more than 50 per cent below the standard national rate of excise duty. A few member states with traditional small artisan brewing sectors avail of this provision. </P>
      <P>Any proposed low or staggered regime would also have to apply to imports of beer produced in small brewereis in other member states in accordance with the provision Article 4.3 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC. Beer excise duty is a specific tax which does not increase in relation to the value of the product. Thus a higher priced premium &ldquo;craft&rdquo; beer bears the same amount of duty as a mass produced product of the same strength and, accordingly, a lower tax share of price than that of a mass produced project. The share of price represented by total tax, including VAT, has declined from 37.6 per cent in 1994 to 35.6 per cent in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> At present there are 13 micro breweries approved by the Revenue Commissioners. While I have no plans to introduce a low or a staggered system of excise duty on beer, I will keep the matter under consideration.</P>

      <P>The first of these issues is the question of equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional child care expenses when they go out to work.

I have also met representatives of the group &ldquo;CHILD&rdquo;, Children's Hospital in Leukaemia Drive, and explained the situation to them. I have emphasised that the implementation of this decision will require close collaboration between the hospitals concerned so as to ensure the best quality of service for patients, and I have <Col N="185" /> welcomed the agreement of the three Dublin children's hospitals to put in place a mechanism for joint decision-making on major policy issues regarding acute hospital services for children.

    <P>Dear Minister</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Forum has been considering the current diagnostic and treatment services available for paediatric oncology.</P>
    <P>At its meeting of 25 March 1998 it heard a very useful presentation on the subject from Dr. Fin Breatnach, Consultant Paediatric Oncologist, Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. Following this the Irish Haematology Society expressed a wish to make a presentation on paediatric leukaemia to the Forum and Dr. Owen Smith, Consultant Paediatric Haematologist, National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, made a presentation on 23 September 1998, on behalf of the Society.</P>
    <P>In considering the issue, the forum was very conscious of the need for high qualify services from the stage of diagnosis to all appropriate forms of treatment, as discussed in the National Cancer Strategy. The forum is also conscious of the EU recommendation (Ref. 1) that there should be one paediatric oncology unit per five million population in Europe. International recommendations (Ref. 2) also state that the treatment of solid tumours should not be separated from the treatment of leukamia and that a Paediatric Cancer Unit (PCU) should have on site the appropriate infrastructure of services, personnel and equipment (Ref. 3) to guarantee an optimum level of service for these patients. Taking these recommendations into consideration the forum considers it inappropriate to have two centres dealing with paediatric leukaemia in Dublin. The forum is of the opinion that there is one specialist paediatric oncology unit in Ireland, at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and that both solid tumours and acute leukaemias should be referred to this centre.</P>
    <P>The forum has formed the view that all paediatric oncology cases should be referred to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin for initial diagnostic work-up and treatment planning. This does not mean that all cases would necessarily have to be treated there. However, given the level of specialised expertise required in dealing with paediatric oncology, the forum believes that every childhood case of cancer should be seen there initially for advice and referral on treatment. Subsequent treatment, including chemo<Col N="186" /> therapy, could then be delivered in the child's most appropriate local hospital, on a clearly defined and agreed shared care basis, subject to proper supervision.</P>
    <P>There exists a high level of expertise in this area and the forum recommends that the personnel involved in paediatric oncology would explore the potential of utilising their skills for optimum patient benefit. This would involve discussion between Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght with a view to seeking agreement on revised structuring of existing consultant posts in order to permit access to the paediatric oncology unit at Our Lady's Hospital for consultants who have special training and expertise in paediatric oncology.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if you would consider transmitting this view to the relevant agencies, including hospitals and consultants who deal with childhood cancers.</P>

      <P>The organisation and management of the national blood transfusion service is a matter for the Blood Transfusion Service Board, BTSB, as specified in its Establishment Order. The BTSB recently completed the provision of new components processing and compatibility testing laboratories at the Cork centre at a cost of £464,000. Funding for this project was made available by my Department as a matter of priority in order to ensure that the BTSB continues to meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board, IMB. The BTSB has advised that the new laboratory is now among the best of its kind in Europe, and that, at a recent inspection by the IMB, the level of compliance was in accordance with the EC guide to good manufacturing practice. Additional capital requirements specified recently by the IMB are currently being assessed by the BTSB. My Department will consider further proposals from the board for additional capital investment including resources necessary to ensure regulatory compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following from the report of the tribunal of inquiry, the BTSB is implementing a wide-ranging programme of modernisation in order to adapt to emerging developments in blood transfusion. In the current year a number of new safety measures are being introduced to further improve blood safety. The introduction of these measures such as leucodepletion and PCR testing ensures <Col N="189" /> that the safety of blood transfusion practices at the BTSB is as good as the best in the world. The cost of the various measures will be approximately £6.8 million in 1999 which has resulted in a unit price increase in red cells from £63 to £94. I have been given to understand that transfusion medicine continues to undergo rapid advancements. New technologies and additional new safety tests are being developed at present and the BTSB is continually assessing such developments to ensure that its practices are in line with best international standards consistent with efficiency and effectiveness.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board, NCRB, collects information on the incidence of, and deaths from cancer in Ireland. The first year for which national information is available is 1994. The following table gives a summary of the trends for the most common cancers for 1994 to 1996. The data indicate that there has been a slight increase in case numbers, detected by the NCRB but this is mainly due to an increase in skin cancer. The rise in skin cancers noted by the NCRB is considered to be due to better detection by the registry and does not necessarily represent a rise in skin cancer in the population. None of the other common cancers, except oesophagus, rose or fell significantly over the period.</P>
      <P>Care must be taken in interpreting data over such a short period. The National Cancer Registry Board will continue to monitor trends in deaths from all forms of cancer in the coming years, and my Department will continue to support the board in its work. I am committed to supporting all possible steps to reduce deaths from cancer. To this end, I am funding the continued implementation of the national cancer strategy. In 1998 I provided £8.7 million for this purpose, with a further £6.855 million going to further enhance the development of cancer services this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer strategy identifies research into cancer as one of the key areas for investment in order to combat this disease. Under the terms of the action plan for the implementation of the national cancer strategy, total funding of £320,000 has been granted in respect of the four years 1997-2000, inclusive, to the Health Research Board for cancer research. When deciding on the projects to fund, the national cancer strategy indicated that the emphasis should be on infrastructural co-ordination and that projects to be funded would be multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary in nature. These criteria are applied when the Health Research Board awards the grants. In addition to the funding allocated under the national cancer strategy, the Health Research Board has provided funding for cancer research in recent years as follows: 1995, £200,550; 1996, £316,641; 1997, £272,376; 1998, £336,053. Total funding in respect of cancer research between 1995 and 1998, therefore, totals £1,286,620. The allocations for 1999 have yet to be made.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department works closely with a wide variety of statutory and voluntary groups to ensure that people have the information and the support to make healthy lifestyle choices.</P>
      <P>The unit supports an extensive range of initiatives, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include national mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The average spend on the anti-smoking and healthy eating campaigns since 1995 has been approximately £500,000 per annum. In addition, the unit spent in excess of £150, 000 on an alcohol awareness campaign last year. The unit has also provided funding of approximately £200,000 each year to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives, including the yearly Europe Against Cancer campaign.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit is also involved in the ongoing development of school based anti-smoking initiatives with the Irish Cancer Society and the Health Promoting Schools Network. The health promotion unit also continues to produce information materials relating to cancer, the cost of which was approximately £160,000 in the period 1995 to 1998. I wish to assure the Deputy of my continued commitment to the further implementation of the national cancer strategy and measures aimed at reducing the incidence of this disease.</P>

      <P>St. Raphael's Training Centre in Celbridge is operated by the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God which is one of a number of major voluntary service providers in the field of mental handicap. My Department's allocation to the order's services in the eastern region in 1999 is £20.977 million. This includes additional funding of £250,000, first provided in 1998, specifically for service issues related to the changing profile of existing clients in St. Raphael's, Celbridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with <Col N="195" /> the needs identified in the &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; 1997-2001&rdquo;. Of this additional funding, £3.635 million has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board, with a full year cost of £4.61 million in 2000. Details of the precise services to be put in place in the eastern region from this additional funding and the individuals who will benefit from these services are agreed by the Central Mental Handicap Planning Committee, which includes representation from the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God.</P>
    <P>As a result of this process, I understand that the St. John of God Order is to receive the following for the development of new services: 4 respite places, £100,000; 6 residential places, £180,000; 13 day places, £130,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state at the outset that my Department recognises the valuable role played by family support workers in supporting people in the home. However, my Department does not set a pay rate or a travel allowance for this category of staff since the type of work performed varies considerably in different health board regions. It is indeed correct, therefore, that the rate of pay applicable to staff categorised as family support workers varies throughout the country since these rates are determined by the employing authority on the basis of their particular requirements and type of task undertaken. It is a matter for the chief executive officer of each individual health board to decide on these issues, including the level of service required and the consequent rate of pay applicable. I understand that, following the lodgement of a pay claim, the Health Service Employers Agency has met with unions representing the staff who are currently consulting their membership.</P>

      <P>The Midland Health Board has set a series of priorities in relation to major capital developments for the acute hospitals in its area. These priorities are: the completion of Phase 2A of the development at Longford/Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar; the capital project that is currently in preparation at Tullamore General Hospital; and the completion of Phase 2B at Longford/Westmeath General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Since these priorities were established some years ago, I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made. Phase 2A in Mullingar is now fully operational. Good progress is being made in relation to the planning process for the capital development at Tullamore General Hospital. In addition, planning is proceeding for important and much needed developments at Portlaoise General Hospital. These comprise an acute psychiatric unit, paediatric unit and other facilities, including renovation of the catering department and ground floor wards.</P>
      <P>Phase 2B at Longford/Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar involves a ward block and theatre suite. The facilities have been constructed to the &ldquo;shelled out&rdquo; phase involving construction of the outer walls, roof, floors and windows. The completion and commissioning of Phase 2B will be considered in the light of available funding as work on the Midland Health Board's other capital priorities proceeds.</P>

Last December the council took delivery of a new Class B fire appliance and new road traffic accident rescue equipment costing about £145,000 and £73,000 respectively.

      <P>I am aware of a recent newspaper report which refers to adverse comments contained in two European tourist guidebooks in relation to drinking water in Ireland. The reported comments regarding the quality of Irish drinking water are grossly inaccurate.</P>
      <P>The quality of drinking water in Ireland is comprehensively monitored by local authorities under the supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The EPA publishes a detailed annual report of the monitoring results. The latest EPA report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, covering the year 1996, confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water. In relation to public supplies, it indicated that compliance levels in respect of strictly health-related parameters were above 98.5 per cent in 1996, apart from coliforms. In the case of coliforms, the compliance levels were 92.4 per cent, representing a slight improvement on the 1995 position. The report acknowledges that there are quality problems in the private group supply sector which supplies drinking water to about 5 per cent of households in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The quality problems associated with the private group supply sector are being tackled in a comprehensive manner under the rural water programme, £30 million has been allocated to the programme in 1999, an increase of £7 million on 1998. A programme of substantial capital investment is being pursued for the purpose of providing and upgrading water supply schemes to cater for demands generally and ensure compliance with the quality standards of the drinking water directive. Expenditure on major water schemes since 1994 has totalled more than £265 million. In 1999, £275 million is being provided under the water and sewerage services investment programme overall, representing an increase of 50 per cent on expenditure in 1998 and is more than double the expenditure on these services in 1996. Clarification in relation to the quality of drinking water in Ireland will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities in the countries in questions.</P>

      <P>A decision on a planning application must be made by a planning authority within two months, unless the planning authority requests further information or extends the two month period with the written consent of the applicant. Comprehensive statistics on the operation of the planning system are published annually by my Department and are available in the Oireachtas Library. Planning statistics for 1997 show that local authorities dealt with approximately 70 per cent of all planning applications within two months. While the statistics set out the aggregate number of planning applications approved or refused in each local authority area, they do not disaggregate approvals or refusals as between residential and other applications.</P>
      <P>In April 1998, my Department wrote to planning authorities asking that they avail of the opportunity presented by planning fee increases, which were effected by new regulations at that time, to consider the possibility if employing more professional planners, either on a contract basis or by redeployment within existing authorised staff levels. It was suggested that the costs involved would be offset, at least partly, by the increase in fee income and that the increased financial resources under the new system of local government finance would also enable local authorities to devote increased resources to planning development and control. My Department wrote to local authority managers in July 1998 asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional/technical and administrative/clerical staffing in order to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of time that it takes to determine a planning application is, of course, dependent on whether or not the decision of the planning authority is appealed. Approximately 8 per cent of planning authority decisions on planning applications are appealed to An Bord Pleanála. As regards the board, I refer to my reply to Question No. 236 on today's Order Paper. My proposals to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning system will be contained in a compre<Col N="200" /> hensive Bill to reform and consolidate planning law to be published by mid-year.</P>

Should it be necessary to replace panels having an asbestos content, the local authority should be consulted in relation to removal and disposal. The environmental health officer of the local health board should be contacted if there are concerns from a health point of view about exposure to asbestos.</P>

      <P>The steep increase in the number of appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála has continued, reflecting the high growth rate in the national economy. The intake of cases in 1998 was 16 per cent up on 1997. It is estimated that the total number of cases received in 1999 will reach 5,050, by far the highest number since 1983 when appeal fees were introduced. The average time taken to dispose of cases in 1998 was 18 weeks and compliance with the four month objective was 63 per cent. The increase in the average time and the decline in meeting the four month objective is a cause of concern and is monitored closely by the board and my Department. Increased staffing has been approved. The staffing level in 1997 increased from 71 to 85. All additional staffing sought by the board in 1998 was approved, bringing the current approved staffing level to 93, and the board is currently in the process of filling the outstanding vacancies. The board has been experiencing difficulty in recruiting suitably qualified and experienced personnel.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1998, I have increased the number of board members by 50 per cent from six to nine. In 1999, the board will have the full year benefit of the extra board members and additional staff approved. In consultation with the board, I am actively reviewing the situation to see what additional measures are required in the light of current performance and the trend in appeals.</P>

      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. These include the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of a social welfare recipient or his/her spouse, the payment of a death grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>Following the death of a recipient of a social welfare payment or his or her spouse, the payment is continued at the same rate for six weeks in circumstances where both spouses had a separate entitlement provided one or both of the entitlements was a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or a carer's allowance or where the payment includes a payment for a qualified adult. The payment does not arise where each spouse had an independent entitlement to an insurance-based contributory pension.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced improvements in the death grant, which is a payment made to certain insured people and their families based on their PRSI contributions to assist in the payment of funeral expenses. The death grant is now being totally redesigned and upgraded in the following ways: increasing the amount payable five-fold from £100 to £500; and improving the coverage by easing the qualifying PRSI conditions and extending the scheme to other PRSI contributors.</P>
      <P>These improvements are provided for in the 1999 Social Welfare Bill, which was published last week. The improvements will take effect from 6 April 1999.</P>
      <P>These improvements, at an estimated cost of £10 million in a full year, are the first step in the development of a new and improved bereavement allowance. Other schemes, including the six week payments after death arrangements will be reviewed further in 1999.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of the value of any capital or investments, together with any cash income that the person has. Under the existing arrangements, farmers claiming unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and the old age (non-contributory) pension can have the first £2,000 of REPS payments disregarded for means purposes and 50 per cent of the balance. In addition, any expenses incurred in complying with REPS measures are also disregarded in the assessment of means.</P>
      <P>Over the years, different methods of assessing capital and income have applied in the case of the various social assistance schemes. Some of these differences are designed to achieve specific policy objectives. For instance, the first £50 of weekly earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature are disregarded when assessing means for disability allowance purposes.</P>
      <P>However, it is recognised that there is a need to standardise many of the different methods of calculating means in order to achieve greater equity within the system. In this regard, considerable progress has already been made in the area of standardising the assessment of capital. The introduction of the disability allowance scheme in October 1996 provided the opportunity to commence this process. Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent. These revised capital assessment provisions were extended to the old age (non-contributory) pension, widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension, orphan's (non-contributory) pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement schemes from October 1997 and to the rent allowance scheme for former controlled tenancies from June 1998.</P>
      <P>The question of standardising the various earnings disregards, including those applying to REPS payments, would have to be examined in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's Programme &ndash; An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This applies to long-term payments only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as unemployment benefit, disability benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents. Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. This policy direction has been continued in the 1999 budget through a full-year investment of over £40 million in the child benefit scheme. From September of this year, the rates of child benefit will be increased by £3 per child per month for the first two children and by £4 per child for the third and subsequent children, bringing the rates up to £34.50 and £46 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase <Col N="207" /> and/or installation of the necessary security equipment.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was initially allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year, I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. This is on top of another £5 million paid on this scheme in 1997. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met. It is important to realise that not all applications received under the 1996 and 1997 schemes were funded at a level of 90 per cent. No decision was made by me to change the basis for making awards under the scheme in 1998. Therefore, I am satisfied that the level of funding made available in 1998 was sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again that year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996, a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people were assisted in 1998. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The deserted wives benefit scheme was discontinued on the introduction of one-parent family payment under the Social Welfare Act, 1996. However, payment was continued for existing recipients of benefit under saver provisions. Under the previous arrangements a woman under 40 who ceased to be entitled to benefit because her child went over the qualifying age limit could requalify on reaching age 40. The legislation provided that this facility would not apply after 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is under age 40 and is receiving deserted wife's benefit because she has a child under age 18. This child reaches age 18 on 10 June next. It is understood that he is currently employed. In the circumstances, he will no longer be a qualified child for the purposes of his mother's claim and under the legislation payment of her deserted wife's benefit would cease at this date. I am having the position in this respect examined and if there is any change as a result, any cases affected will be reviewed and the persons concerned will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>A separate payment system is already available whereby special arrangements can be made to ensure that a spouse or partner receives a portion of the weekly social welfare payment paid directly in respect of him/herself and children. The system applies in a relatively small number of cases where there are domestic problems.</P>
      <P>The manner in which different types of households are treated under the tax and social welfare systems is at present being considered by a working group chaired by my Department which is, among other things, charged with identifying and costing ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of different types of household. The question of making separate social welfare payments directly to adult dependants, as envisaged in the Deputy's question, is being considered by this group. It is expected that it will report in the next few months. Making the separate payment facility available on a more general basis would have substantial administrative and cost implications. A considerable additional investment would be needed in the Department's computer systems and this would have implications for other projects. Depending on the number of applications received, it is estimated that this development could, under present arrangements, cost up to £6 million per annum in additional administration costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken to give recognition to the position of those who work in the home. Special arrangements for homemakers have been introduced whereby contribution years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of 12, or incapacitated people, may be disregarded when calculating the yearly average number of contributions for pension purposes. The Department will shortly be undertak<Col N="210" /> ing a review of the provision to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pension purposes. This is in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>In relation to retirement and old age (contributory) pensions, each of a couple may qualify for payment in his/her own right, depending on their social insurance record. In this context, the number of women qualifying for these pensions in their own right is likely to increase, reflecting the increase in the number of women who are now entering/re-entering the workforce and paying social insurance as well as the operation of the homemaker's provisions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the old age (non-contributory) pension, each of a couple is entitled to a separate pension where he/she is over 66 years of age and each will receive the same level of pension in his/her own right. I do not consider that the present arrangement for payment of arrears in respect of spouses devalues the role of the spouse in the home. However, I will take account of any views in this regard which are put forward in the report of the working group referred to above in deciding on future arrangements for payments to households.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance and free television licences are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. In addition, widows-widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses  had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement. The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this Department does not maintain statistics on the number of recipients of pre-retirement allowance who live alone, it is not possible to estimate the cost of extending the free television licence and free electricity allowance schemes to this group. However, if the schemes were extended to all PRETA recipients, the cost would be of the order of £3 million per year. The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health <Col N="211" /> board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible householders for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
    <P>A person may qualify for a fuel allowance if they are in receipt of a qualifying payment and fulfil the living alone conditions. Pre-retirement allowance is a qualifying payment for the national fuel scheme. Under the conditions of the fuel scheme the applicant must live alone or only with a dependent spouse-partner-child(ren) or other eligible recipients, or short-term unemployment assistance recipients, or a person who gives full-time care and attention if the applicant is an invalid or semi-invalid.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the views of the Heritage Council, I have sought clarification from the Attorney General as to the legal status of the deer hunted by the Ward Union Hunt, whether they are wild or domesticated, and whether or not they constitute private property. I felt that it was reasonable, pending receipt of the views of the Attorney General, to continue with the existing situation in relation to the licensing of the Ward Union Hunt. In coming to this view, in the context of my primary responsibility in relation to conservation, I had regard to the absence of evidence that the activities of the Ward Union Hunt have an adverse effect on the conservation of deer or wild life. I decided, therefore, that a licence should be issued in the normal way to the Ward Union Hunt for one further year.</P>
      <P>This licence specifies that: (a) deer may be hunted from 15 October 1998 to 31 March 1999; (b) the club shall supply details of the number and sex of all deer released and not recaptured together with an indication of where such deer were last sighted, this information to be supplied as soon as possible after 31 March 1999; and (c) I, as Minister, may appoint a person or persons to undertake the monitoring of the Ward Union Hunt Club and that the licensee will co-operate with such person or persons and will indemnify, and keep indemnified, me, as Minister, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to such monitoring.</P>

      <Quest>if her Department will accept the full costs of the provision of a central heating system for a house owned by her Department at the Lock, Graiguecullen, Carlow, in view of the fact that the occupants are old age pensioners and unable to make a contribution having experienced severe hardship due to the flooding of their home and property; the plans, if any, she has in relation to the preservation and renovation of this Georgian property; if her Department will accept the costs of temporary re-housing and accommodation caused when the occupants had to re-locate due to flooding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has agreed to meet the cost of materials for the provision of a central heating system in the house to be installed by the occupants. Having regard to the conditions under which the occupants continue to reside in the house, this is considered to be a reasonable arrangement. My Department has no other plans at present in relation to the renovation of the house. As the flooding of the house was beyond the control of my Department, it is not possible to accept liability for any costs incurred by the occupants as referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the package of legislative, financial and administration measures announced by myself and my colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, last year, which are intended to strengthen the protection of our architectural heritage, including houses, castles and other buildings of architectural and historical interest. The package of measures includes the establishment of a new grant aid scheme for approved conservation works to protected (listed) buildings which will commence this year. This scheme will be administered by local authorities and will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum. I under<Col N="215" /> stand that details of the new scheme will be announced in the near future.</P>
      <P>Another source of public funds for heritage projects is the Heritage Council, which is a statutory, autonomous body. The council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions made by it on the disbursal of grants. I was, however, pleased to be able to increase funding for the Heritage Council from £4 million in 1998 to £5.08 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>As far as my Department is concerned directly, while it has no grant giving function in relation to listed buildings, it does have a role in assessing buildings in relation to section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, under which tax relief may be claimed on the cost of repairs or restoration of buildings which are determined by me to be intrinsically of significant architectural, historical, scientific or aesthetic interest.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that the property had been offered for sale.</P>
      <P>The monument has been entered on the Register of Historic Monuments under section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, and it, therefore, enjoys protection under the Act by virtue of the fact that the owner or occupier must give me two months notice if he/she proposes to carry out, or to cause or permit the carrying out of, any work at or in relation to the monument or area. However, there is no obligation on the owner to inform me of an intention to dispose of the property.</P>
      <P>As the monument has been recorded, its purchase by my Department is not necessary to ensure its protection.</P>

However, at this stage, I have no plans to provide toilet facilities at this dolmen.</P>

      <P>A letter of formal notice under Article 169 of the EU Treaty, alleging failure to comply with Articles 6(2) and 6(3) of the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) in respect of drainage works carried out at Glen Lake, issued to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 11 November 1998 and was received on 19 November 1998.</P>
      <P>It is believed that Ireland is in compliance with the Directive in respect of this matter. The work undertaken at Glen Lake involved the maintenance of an existing drainage regime and is not considered to have had a significant adverse impact on the wild bird habitats in the special protection area (SPA).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a number of measures are being taken to enhance the Glen Lake SPA. Funding of £85,000 is being provided under the EU LIFE Regulation (£35,000 for land acquisition and £50,000 towards engineering costs). It is proposed to block the drains at Glen Lake to ensure an appropriate water level is maintained in the SPA. This will occur after the current water level subsides. The situation will be monitored and, if necessary, a sluice gate will be put in place. In the meantime, a hydrometric gauge which was installed last summer on the lake is providing data which will be <Col N="217" /><Col N="218" /> used in determining whether a sluice system is required. A gauge of this type requires at least one year's data before an appropriate water level may be ascertained. Another major element of the project will be the setting in place of a conservation plan for the habitats and work on the plan is at the preliminary draft stage. I understand that one significant land purchase has been successfully negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268, 275 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>Jurisdication in Wards of Court matters is vested in the High Court. As the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to me to intervene or comment on the conduct of any individual case.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are in excess of 170 applications for dismissal from wardship waiting to be processed in the Office of Wards of Court. This situation has arisen out of staff shortages in that office. Any inconvenience or hardship caused to next of kin or beneficiaries of the estates of deceased wards as a result of delays in processing these cases is greatly regretted.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 27 January 1999, following recent consultations with the unions concerned, three outstanding vacancies in this office are due to be filled shortly. In addition, in response to historic staff shortages in the office which predated my appointment as Minister, I sought additional staff resources and have received sanction from the Minister for Finance for five new posts to tackle the backlog.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these measures will ensure that the necessary steps can now be taken to bring forward the processing of all applications, including those to discharge wardships.</P>
      <P>As to the listing of wardship cases, the Deputy will be aware that this is a responsibility of the courts and I have no function in the matter. I have, however, had inquiries made and I am informed that, apart from the initial application to have a person declared a ward of court, very few wardship applications are listed before the court. Most matters are dealt with by the office and those cases requiring a decision of the court are dealt with in chambers. I am informed by the Registrar, Office of Wards of Court, that when cases requiring a decision of the court are ready to proceed they are listed for hearing in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>Under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935 as amended, a licence is required for any place where public dancing is proposed to take place. In this regard, the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997, is also relevant. Licences are obtainable by application to the District Court.</P>
      <P>The court may hear any member of the Garda Síochána or any person interested in the application for the purpose of supporting or opposing the application. Moreover, the court may impose conditions limiting the numbers to be admitted or specifying precautions to be observed at the venue.</P>
      <P>The question of safety and crowd control in discos are matters for the appropriate local authority and fire officer to address with the organiser, in order to ensure the safety of those attending.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273, 291 and 292 together.</P>
      <P>There has been no finding by the European Commission that Ireland is in breach of the terms of the EU Directive on Parental Leave. I understand that following the Parental Leave Act coming into operationn on 3 December 1998, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) formally lodged a complaint with the European Commission to the effect that Ireland had not correctly transposed the EU Directive on Parental Leave (96/34/EC).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came to my attention recently that the equal opportunities unit of DG V of the EU Commission replied to ICTU indicating that it believed that Ireland had incorrectly implemented the directive by restricting the right to parental leave to children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996. I understand that this is a preliminary view which it is the practice of the <Col N="222" /> Commission to give on receipt of a complaint in advance of detailed investigation.</P>
    <P>The complaint is currently at the stage of investigation formally by the Commission. It is simply too early to say whether there is a case to be answered. Any question of whether the Act should be amended, therefore, does not arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should add that my Department has, as yet, received no communication from the European Commission regarding this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Parental Leave Act, 1998 has been in operation only since 3 December 1998, that is for a little more than two months, there are no plans at this time to amend the legislation to provide for parents of children with special needs on a different basis than parents of other children, nor is it currently intended to amend the legislation for any other reason.</P>
      <P>There is a requirement under section 28 of the Parental Leave Act, for a review of its operation not earlier than two years and not later than three years after its commencement. Such a review will take place after consultation with representatives of employers and employees. That review would be an appropriate occasion to consider whether amending the legislation for any reason is called for.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, due to a staff shortage, the local Land Registry Office attached to the Circuit Court Office in Limerick was closed temporarily on 6 April 1998.</P>
      <P>A vacancy in this office arose in December 1997 which, for reasons outside its control, my Department found itself unable to fill. It subsequently proved impossible to keep the records there up to date. I informed the House in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 283 of 6 May 1998 that as these records are relied upon by legal practitioners engaged in the conveyancing of property for clients, it was felt that liability for potential loss might be incurred because of failure to keep the records up to date. Accordingly, the county registrar decided to close the Land Registry Office.</P>
      <P>A temporary appointment was made to this office in June 1998. The person appointed has since been employed on clearing the arrears situation and will continue until such time as the ongoing efforts to make a permanent appointment can be successfully concluded. In the meantime, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that progress on bringing the records up to date has been such that the office reopened on 3 February 1999 for inspection of folios and indices and I am informed by the county registrar that the office will be in a posiiton to offer a full service as formerly, including copy folios, later this month.</P>

      <P>The total cost of overtime paid to the gardaí in 1998 was £50.3 million, including a payment of £6.2 million arrears under the Garda pay deal. Approximately 14 per cent (i.e £7 million) was incurred in respect of court attendance by gardaí.</P>
      <P>Developments in the legislative area that will, in the long-term, reduce the number of hours spent by gardaí attending court are currently being implemented. I refer in particular to section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1997. This provides that evidence of arrest, charge and caution can be presented by a court sergeant by way of certificate prepared by the garda who effected the arrest. This certificate is presented to the initial court hearing. It applies to offences where the accused is arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very large number of minor offences relate to matters addressed by the Road Traffic Act. The introduction of fines on the spot (for speeding, parking and non-display of disc offences) and the vehicle rectification scheme has reduced the need to bring court proceedings in a significant number of cases and this has implications for the amount of Garda time spent in court. The extension of fines on the spot for road traffic offences is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. On 1 February 1999 he extended the scope of fines on the spot to include <Col N="226" /> those offences recommended by the national strategy on road safety. The offences in question are non-wearing of seat belts, stop-yield infringements, box junction violations and defective tyres.</P>

      <P>It is understood from the Garda authorities that contacts, in the north and south inner city areas of Dublin, between the gardaí and the community have given rise to the term police forum.</P>
      <P>Following an examination of this type of approach, the Commissioner has, through the Garda community relations section, established a small group within the Dublin region to examine the format for such a forum. The group consists of Garda representatives at national, regional and local level, along with community representatives from the Dublin inner city areas.</P>
      <P>Among the issues being addressed by the group are the objectives of a police forum; the geographic area to be covered by a police forum; criteria for selecting community representatives; degree of Garda representation at various meetings; frequency and location of meetings; chairmanship of police forum; and selection and training of forum members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once this group has completed their deliberations, their findings will be further examined and <Col N="227" /> the initiative progressed in the most effective and efficient manner, if this is appropriate.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other initiatives in place throughout the country, where the community plays an active role with the Garda in policing their local areas, for example, the Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes. The Department has recently carried out an evaluation of these community based initiatives. The research was carried out by an independent social and economic research consultancy firm in association with the Garda research unit. This report, and another report on the structures of Neighbourhood Watch, will shortly be submitted to the Department by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The recently launched integrated services project is an example of where the Garda, the community, voluntary organisations and statutory agencies come together to address local issues. This project is under way in four designated areas &ndash; Dublin's north east inner city, the canal communities, Jobstown in Tallaght and Togher in Cork. The aim of this project is to develop a more focused and co-ordinated response by the statutory agencies to the needs of the communities. The ultimate objective is to develop from this a model of best practice from a diversity of experience which can be replicated in other areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the process of maintaining and developing good community relations is a high priority with the Garda who are committed to working closely with the local communities. I consider that one of the most important developments in recent years has been the obvious improvement in relations between the Garda Síochána and disadvantaged urban communities. Both the communities and the Garda are to be commended for their work in this area.</P>

      <P>In December last, the Government approved my proposals for the establishment of a working group to undertake a comprehensive review of the coroner service. The group had its inaugural meeting on 17 December 1998 and is chaired by a senior official from my Department.</P>
      <P>Membership nominations were sought and received from a wide variety of bodies including the Departments of Health and Children, Finance, Environment and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Office of the Attorney General, the Garda Síochána, the Eastern Health Board, the City and County Managers' Association and the Coroners' Association of Ireland. The group also has representatives from the Samaritans, general practitioners, solicitors and patholgists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been achieved in the disability area since this Government took office and I am committed to continuing the momentum that has been generated and to making further progress in this area.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made, in particular, in the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality.</P>
      <P>In November 1997 and in July 1998 we made significant announcements regarding the key infrastructural recommendations of the report relating to the establishment of a National Disability Authority (NDA) and a Disability Support Service.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made towards achieving our commitments in relation to the issue of mainstreaming of training and employment services for people with disabilities as well as the provision of a comprehensive, accessible information service.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a permanent representative council of people with disabilities is being facilitated and funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>Six pilot community projects relating to people with disabilities are being funded by my Department, in line with the commission's recommendations. Four of these relate to access to information and participation in the local decision making process and two relate to the facilitation of cross-sectoral planning for delivery of services.</P>
      <P>A plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities is currently being drafted by an interdepartmental taskforce. This plan is based on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and it is my intention to submit it to Government as soon as possible after it is finalised.</P>
      <P>We are also establishing a monitoring committee under the aegis of my Department to progress the attainment of the 3 per cent target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service.</P>
      <P>In the 1998 budget, significant measures were adopted across a range of Government Departments which will impact favourably on the lives of people with disabilities. These apply in particular in the areas of health, education, environment and social, community and family affairs.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, which impacts on disability, was signed by the President in June 1998. This legislation outlaws discrimination in employment on grounds of disability and its enactment gives people with disabilities the protection of the law for the first time in relation to access to employment and advancement within employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that it will also contribute to a reduction in the unacceptable high rates of unemployment of people with disabilities generally and build an awareness of the prevalence of discrimi<Col N="231" /> nation on grounds of disability in the workplace. I hope to be in a position to commence implementing the Employment Equality Act, 1998 about the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to bring equal status legislation before the Oireachtas. This legislation will outlaw discrimination on similar grounds as the employment equality legislation, but outside the workplace. As indicated by the Government Chief Whip when he announced the Government's legislation programme on 26 January 1999, a revised Equal Status Bill is among the several items of legislation which it is my intention to publish in the period from the start of this Dáil session up to the end of the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned in my reply, one of the key infrastructural recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities related to the establishment of a National Disability Authority (NDA) and a Disability Support Service. On 18 November 1997 the Government gave approval in principle to the establishment, on a statutory basis, of a National Disabiliy Authority and a Disability Support Service and it approved the formation of an establishment group tasked, <i>inter alia</i>, with the preparaton of detailed proposals for the establishment of the NDA. Subsequently, on 27 July 1998, the Government adopted the report of the establishment group, Building a Future Together, and approved the drafting, as a matter of priority, of a National Disability Authority Establishment Bill.</P>
    <P>On 29 July 1998 I appointed the board of the NDA on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>The National Disability Authority Bill, 1998 was published on 3 December 1998. The Bill passed Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad on 17 December 1998 and Second Stage is expected to be taken shortly in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the issues of mainstreaming of training and employment services for people with disabilities and the provision of a comprehensive, accessible information service, it is envisaged that this will involve: (a) the transfer of vocational training and employment services from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; (b) meeting the information, advice and advocacy requirements of people with disabilities, their families and carers by the establishment of a new organisation under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which will merge the appropriate services of the National Rehabilitation Board and the National Social Services Board to form one mainstream organisation and (c) the provision within the health services of the audiology services currently provided by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>Of the six pilot projects already referred to, three (in Cork, Tallaght-Clondalkin and Cahirciveen) are being facilitiated by local area partnerships while a fourth, in Ennis, is being facilitated by the Disabled People of Clare. The main aims of the projects are to facilitate acccess <Col N="232" /> at local level by people with disabilities to information in accessable formats and to promote participation by people with disabilities in local decision making processes. The commission also recommended that community action plans be drawn up to facilitate cross-sectoral planning at local level for the delivery of services to people with disabilities. In this regard, I am pleased to say that we furnished funding of £45,000 to facilitate two pilot community action plans which are focusing on transport. The plans are being piloted in Meath and south Mayo and it is intended that they will develop models of good practice which can be replicated in other areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The above illustrates to some degree the extent of the commitment of the Government to advancing the interests of people with disabilities at the highest level and to ensuring that disability is placed on the agenda of every  Government Department.</P>

      <P>Over the past decade more than £1 billion has been invested in Irish tourism marketing, product development and training under two EU co-funded Operational Programmes for Tourism. This unprecedented level of investment is the result of a unique partnership approach by the industry, the State and the EU.</P>
      <P>The results of this investment and the independent activity of our industry is that our tourism growth between 1990 and 1997 was substantially higher than the average achieved by world tourism and, in particular, European tourism. In that period, Ireland returned annual average growth rates of 7 per cent per annum for overseas visitor arrivals and 10 per cent for visitor receipts, compared to annual average increases of 4 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, for world tourism arrivals and receipts, and 4 per cent and 6 per cent for Europe.</P>
      <P>Ireland is rated highly as a tourist destination by overseas visitors. A survey of non-Irish born holidaymakers to Ireland conducted by Bord Fáilte in 1997 found that Ireland rated highly in terms of the quality of the scenery, the friendliness and hospitality of the Irish people, the relaxed pace of life and the natural, unspoilt  environment.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte's forecasts for 1999 are for a 7 per cent growth in overseas visitor numbers to approximately 5.9 million and a 9 per cent growth in foreign revenue earnings to approximately £2.5 billion. While final outturns for 1998 are not yet available from the Central Statistics Office, it is expected, based on projections and recent performance, that our four largest markets will continue to be Britain, North America, Germany and France. Of a total of five million overseas visitors in 1997, 2.8 million came from Britain, 777,000 from North America, 303,000 from Germany and 250,000 from France.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 298 together.</P>
      <P>The following organisations have applied for recognition for funding purposes under the scheme for national governing bodies of sport: The Irish Martial Arts Commission, June 1995; ONAKAI (Official National Amateur Karate Association of Ireland), September 1996; Irish Taekwondo Union, November 1996; Contract Bridge Association of Ireland, April 1988; Irish Aviation Council, April 1998. Ski Association of Ireland 20 July 1995; National Ploughing Association of Ireland, June 1995; Irish Parascending Association, 12 November 1997; Irish Pool Association, 1 July 1998; Irish Rugby League, 4 December 1998, and the Model Aeronautics Council of Ireland, Summer 1993.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated in the House my priority has been to prepare the legislation for the establishment of the new statutory Sports Council which will provide a framework for the future execution of sports policy, including policy in relation to sports bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recognition of individual sports and recreational activities, including bridge, will be a matter for the new Sports Council to consider in <Col N="234" /> the context of its statutory remit. As the Deputy will be aware, the House has recently completed the second stage of the legislative process on the Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, current criteria for use in determining recognition for funding purposes of bodies as set out in sections 15 and 16 of my Department's Freedom of Information Reference Book&rdquo; are currently being reviewed so that the new statutory council will be in a position to address the recognition issue, and outstanding applications, as soon as possible after establishment.</P>
    <P>All current applicants have been in contact with the executive chairman of the Irish Sports Council while I have personally met, at their request, with the Contract Bridge Association and informed them of my general approach to the recognition of sports and recreational acitivities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299, 300 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of the Government's policy to help to overcome the isolating effects of social exclusion in disadvantaged areas it has been agreed with the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union to provide funding specifically to them for suitable proposals for pilot initiatives to increase participation in their sports in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department are currently in dicussion with representatives of the GAA to further refine their proposals for disadvantaged areas, for which funding of up to £150,000 has been allocated, £40,000 of which was included in 1998 grant payments to the GAA. Planning and development of the pilot projects is well <Col N="235" /> advanced at this stage. Cities identified are Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Dublin, and it now remains for the GAA to finalise exact locations before individual projects get up and running.</P>
    <P>An initial submission has also been received from the FAI and I understand that a proposal is expected shortly from the IRFU.</P>
    <P>Pending agreement on the details of their proposals with the three bodies, it is not possible to be specific as to the areas where the projects will be located and the exact level of funding which will be required in 1999.</P>
    <P>The executive chairman of the Irish Sports Council has met with all three organisations and is closely monitoring developments, with a view to having pilot projects in all three codes in place as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 to 376, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of 1998 is set in the form of a tabular statement which I shall circulate in the Official Report. In addition to these allocations an amount of £964,365 was also allocated to national governing bodies of sport in respect of their high performance players-athletes participating in the 1998 international carding scheme. The financial allocations to national governing bodies of sport for 1999 are currently being finalised in consultation with the Irish Sports Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 383 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-9 was designed to bring about social and economic development at a local level, to involve and enable local communities to be involved in that development in a formal way and to achieve physical improvements to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comprises three main integrated sub-programmes on local enterprise which is managed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas, and urban <Col N="249" /> and village renewal which is managed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Technical assistance is provided for under the fourth sub-programme. Total funding under the programme as at 31 December 1998 is £339 million (EUR 437m). Expenditure under the OP to date has been progressing steadily, as follows: 1994 &ndash; £14 million (EUR 18m); 1995 &ndash; £56 million (EUR 68m); 1996 &ndash; £61 million (EUR 79m); 1997 &ndash; £76 million (EUR 102m); 1998 &ndash; £79 million (EUR 103m) (estimate) and currently totals £286 million (EUR 370m). Each of the sub-programmes is confident that all available funds will be committed and spent within programme deadlines.</P>
    <P>My Department has particular responsibility for sub-programme 2 &ndash; integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas which is administered by ADM Ltd.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee for the operational programme for local urban and rural development 1994-9 has met on ten occasions since the operational programme was agreed. The last meeting was held on 7 October 1998. The next meeting is due to take place on 31 March 1999 and one of the main documents for that meeting will be the 1998 annual report. I will arrange to have a copy of this report forwarded to the Deputy following its adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 381 together.</P>
      <P>As there is no community initiatives monitoring committee as such, I take it that the Deputy's interest, in this instance, is the only community initiative for which my Department has lead responsibility, i.e. the community initiative known as the operational programme for URBAN 1996-9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for URBAN is designed to tackle urban issues in an integrated way, supporting business creation, improving infrastructure and the physical environment, providing customised training, and actions for equality of opportunity and social amenities, in line with the strategic action plans drawn up for each of the three areas. Total funding available under the URBAN OP is some £22.1 million (EUR 28.2 million). The OP makes funding available across a number of sub-programmes, one for each of the three selected areas in Ireland; the north Dublin area of Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale <Col N="250" /> (sub-programme 1 &ndash; £10.4 million/EUR 13.3 million), west Tallaght-Clondalkin in south-west Dublin (sub-programme 2 &ndash; £5.4 million/EUR 6.9 million) and the northside of Cork city (sub-programme 3 &ndash; £5.4 million/EUR 6.9 million), sub-programme 4 funds technical assistance activities (£0.9million/EUR 1.1 million).</P>
    <P>A total of £15.8 million (EUR 20.1 million) or 72 per cent of total available funding has been committed as of 31 December 1998. Actual expenditure under the OP to 31 December 1998 was some £6 million (EUR 7.7 million) or 27 per cent of the overall budget. Given the bottom-up nature of the programme, this initial low level of spend was to be expected particularly given the time needed to have the new collaborative structures put in place and the volume and scale of the community infrastructural projects being supported. However, the three steering groups under the OP expect a sharp increase in expenditure in 1999 and are confident of their ability to commit and spend all remaining funds within programme deadlines.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee for URBAN OP has met on five occasions since the OP was agreed. The next meeting is due to take place on 18 February 1999. One of the main documents for that meeting is the 1998 annual report. I will arrange to have a copy of this report forwarded to the Deputy following its adoption.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the restoration of real power and decision-making at local level, as part of its major programme of local government reform. To this end, it established an inter-Departmental task force for the integration of local government and local development systems last year, of which I was a member.</P>
      <P>The task force produced a report containing recommendations which are laying the groundwork for a closer working relationship between the local government and local development sectors and also for a more integrated framework for the development and delivery of public services at city-county level. These recommendations were endorsed by the Government, which include, <i>inter alia,</i> the replacement of city-county strategy groups by more comprehensive city-county development boards in January 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development boards will comprise representatives of local government; State agencies at local level, local development agencies and the social partners, including the community and vol<Col N="251" /> untary sector. Together, they will draw up city-county strategies on economic, social and cultural development which will form the policy framework for all relevant agencies operating locally. The new, integrated system will mean more focused and inclusive local governance, with real and meaningful local input.</P>
    <P>As regards rural development in particular, the Department of Agriculture and Food is currently preparing a White Paper on the subject, which will set out Government policy in this area for the medium to long-term. It is expected that the White Paper will be published in the next few months. I am advised that, in preparing the White Paper, regard will be had to the work of rural partnerships and community groups, funded under sub-programme 2 of the operational programme for local, urban and rural development (LURD).</P>
    <P>With regard to equality issues, which are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, ADM Ltd., manages, on an agency basis, the equal opportunities childcare programme on behalf of that Department, which is focused on areas of disadvantage. The partnerships have, as a result, also been involved in the development and implementation of the programme as a whole.</P>
    <P>In framing proposals for a future local development programme, under the national development plan, 2000-6, my Department will take full account of the experience and results of the current operational programme and of the role of other Departments and statutory agencies in the local development field.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that in 1997, the latest year for which final expenditure data is available, tourists from Britain, Ireland's biggest single market, spent £683 million in the Irish economy which at 43 per cent is close to half of the total overseas tourist spend. However, in terms of <i>per capita </i>spend, the American tourist, spending an average of £448 per head while holidaying in Ireland was the biggest spender in 1997. Bórd Fáilte are forecasting growth of 11 per cent for the British market and 9 per cent for the US market this  year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 419 together.</P>
      <P>The objective of the middle level technician and higher technical-business skills programme is to enhance industrial competitiveness and growth by providing initial third level education and training to meet the technical and higher level manpower needs of the economy and the regulations emphasise the extent to which training conditions mirror the reality of the work environment, thereby preparing trainees for the workplace.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the middle level technician and higher technical-business skills programme state that: &ldquo;Trainees on the programmes will be subject to normal industrial disciplines during training regarding time keeping, absenteeism etc., and the Institute Authorities will be required to reflect these factors in the payment of allowances. Trainees may be allowed sick leave without reduction in the level of grant for a maximum of 15 days per academic year. All such absences must be notified to the Institute Authorities in writing.&rdquo; Normal industrial discipline refers to the normal conditions which exist in the workplace, for example notifying absences due to illness in writing to the college authorities. My Department does not have any details in relation to the amount of maintenance grants payments students are losing under this provision of the ESF maintenance grants scheme and it had not been brought to my attention that this provision is causing concern to many students.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme allow for the payments of grants in three equal instalments. These grants are paid on the basis of the student continuing to be a registered student at college rather than a roll call taken on a daily basis which is the system which operates on ESF aided courses in the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The method of payment of grants under the various student support schemes is one of the issues which will be addressed in the context of the review of the administration of the third level student support schemes which is being undertaken by officials of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied to my Department for a resource teacher. I can assure the Deputy that I would not regard it as reasonable to expect a remedial teacher to deal adequately with 70 children.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have attached a clear priority to the development of support services for children with special educational needs in the primary system.</P>
      <P>I consider that my commitment in this regard is clearly demonstrated by my decision to extend the remedial teacher service to every primary school in the country with effect from September next. A total of 225 additional teacher posts are being made available to support this development and also to facilitate the extension of the home-school-community liaison scheme to all primary schools which are designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>As a result of the new resources being provided by this Government, Tavneena national school will be among the schools which will receive a remedial service from September next.</P>
      <P>I also recently announced a major new initiative under which all children assessed as having special education needs arising from a disability will henceforth be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of each individual child. Already under this new initiative, my Department has allocated an additional 33 resource teacher posts and 156 child care assistant posts to support special needs children in the primary system.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have taken will ensure that all primary school children who require remedial or resource teacher support will receive the necessary assistance to enable them to gain maximum benefit from their participation in the education system.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently re-examining the accommodation requirements of St. Killian's school in the light of the recent application. When this work has been completed, my Department will be in further contact with the school management. At this stage, I am not in a position to give a commitment in respect of a major project at the school.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 397 and 408 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that an application was received in my Department from a local group, An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, regarding the provision of an all-Irish second level school in north-east Dublin. The proposed location of the school was a site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin in Artane.</P>
      <P>An examination of the need for such facility was carried out by the planning section of my Department. The result indicated a significant level of demand arising from increased all-Irish provision at primary school level in this area in recent years. An assessment carried out by the technical staff of my Department revealed that, at 1.2 acres, the proposed site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin would be totally inadequate as a location for a permanent school building.</P>
      <P>I accept that some pupils in north-east Dublin may experience inconvenience in terms of distance to an existing all-Irish second level school. My Department will continue to work with An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to develop an appropriate response at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>There are no other applications in my Department at present for the provision of additional all-Irish primary or second level schools in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are many primary schools in the country, including all the primary schools in County Wexford, which do not yet have access to my Department's psychological service. One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels. On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase. At the end of the five-year period, it is envisaged that every school in the country will have access to a schools psychological service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that psychological services to primary schools are much enhanced in the current school year with the appointment in 1998 of 15 psychologists specifically for that sector in a development project involving my <Col N="261" /> Department's psychological service and Mary Immaculate College of Education.</P>
    <P>Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin shortly, with the recruitment of 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It is intended that the psychological service will be an integrated service for the primary and second level sectors and, from now on, newly recruited psychologists will be expected to work in both sectors. My Department is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the needs and resources available in all parts of the country, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> The numbers of psychologists do not include psychologists in promotional posts who are not directly engaged in work in schools, two in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and three in 1997-98. Eight of the post-primary psychologists were promoted to the grade of senior during the school year 1997-98. Because of their new supervisory responsibilities, they consequently devoted somewhat less of their time to casework than had previously been the case.</P>
    <P>The service to primary schools is much enhanced in the current school year with the appointment in 1998 of 15 psychologists specifically for that sector in a development project involving my Department's psychological service and Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report of the planning group for the national educational psychological service will begin shortly. It is envisaged that 25 additional psychologists will be recruited during each of the years 1999 and 2000. These psychologists should begin to take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. My Department is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the needs and resources available in all parts of the country, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the change of circumstances clause of the European Social Fund-aided maintenance grant scheme, a candidate's eligibility for grant aid may be reassessed in the event of a change in reckonable income which is likely to be permanent. This change in circumstances may be positive or negative and in either situation the revised income is annualised and the grant entitlement assessed thereon. My officials have checked the method of assessment in this case with Roscommon VEC and I understand that the correct procedure was followed in this case.</P>

      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The enrolment of Asdee national school on 30 September 1999 was 85 pupils. Under the existing staffing schedule, this is insufficient for the retention of the fourth teaching post at the school. However, I should point out to the Deputy that I have not as yet made final decisions regarding the staffing allocations which will apply in primary schools in the 1999-2000 school year. When decisions have been taken in this matter, my officials will examine the position of Asdee national school and correspond with the school's managerial authorities in the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. Similarly tuition fees under the free fees initiative, are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance on a course at the same level. These restrictions apply to every student who already holds a qualification at any level, irrespective of where that qualification was obtained.</P>
      <P>As the student referred to by the Deputy already holds a degree from Leeds University, he is, therefore, ineligible for a higher education grant or to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of the degree course he is currently pursuing at Trinity College Dublin.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training which was introduced in October 1994 is funded by the Department of Health and Children. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Commission on Nursing has recommended that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses should be based on a four year degree programme and a forum, involving the third level institutions, the schools of nursing, health services providers and An Board Altranais is being established by the Minister for Health and Children to agree a strategy for the implementation of degree level pre-registration nursing education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the one year full-time degree course leading to a Bachelor of Nursing which is offered by National University of Ireland, Galway, to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programmes, has not been recognised for the purposes of the free fees initiative. In relation to the question of degree programmes, there are a number of part-time programmes which are provided on a self-financing basis. The course at National University of Galway is the only full-time degree course. I understand that the Minister for Health and Children is not in a position to provide funding for these courses which lead to optional post-registration qualification. As legal proceedings have been instituted in relation to the non-pay<Col N="266" /> ment of fees for the course in question, I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</P>

As the student in question has already pursued year one of a diploma course and is now pursuing year one of a degree course she is ineligible for grant assistance for this year. She will, however, be eligible to apply for a grant for the remaining years of her course.</P>
