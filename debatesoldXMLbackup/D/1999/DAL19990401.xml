      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific information. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, dealt with this matter on Question Time last Tuesday. The Government has always played its part in relation to refugees in situations of this kind. I do not know what contact the Minister has had with his colleagues in Europe. Clearly he has been engaged in the Northern Ireland talks during the past few days. The Government has given the Irish aid agencies involved an increased allocation of funding. Should I have any further information from the Minister I will keep the Deputy posted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste in a position to inform the House about the Northern talks which are at a delicate and crucial stage? Will she accept the support of all Members for the delicate efforts under way to implement the crucial final stages of the Agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of the House have been together in trying to resolve the ongoing difficulties in putting the Good Friday Agreement into effect. The parties have been in negotiations all night with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Taoiseach. I am not in a position to inform the House of the situation because the negotiations are at a delicate and sensitive stage. In the course of this morning or today the Government will be in touch with the Opposition parties, which is the normal procedure. As soon as we have information we will be in contact with <Col N="211" /> the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Green Party.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources said on 6 July last year that 11 people would be appointed to a seaweed forum. If the Minister is having difficulty filling the positions, I am willing to help him with regard to nominations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate all those involved in ensuring that the Special Olympics will be held in Ireland in 2003. This will be a significant event for the country. The quick publication and enactment of the Equal Status Bill and the Disability Bill would be an appropriate recognition of the significance of the achievement. Will the Tánaiste indicate when those Bills will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for his comments. I commend my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, who worked extremely hard on this matter. He succeeded in securing the Special Olympics for Ireland, which will be a prestigious event.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin's point about the Bills is valid. The Equal Status Bill will be published after Easter and the disability Bill is further down the line. The Bills are necessary in any event but given that the Special Olympics will be held here, Deputy Howlin's remarks are fitting and we will try to expedite the disability Bill.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Yesterday morning there was another gangland murder in Churchtown. A man who was due to receive £100,000 in a redundancy payment today was mown down in cold blood. This is one of a series of gangland killings. What measures, either legislative or administrative, are proposed to deal with this? When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in Opposition, he promised he would set up a special unit to deal with complicated murder inquiries.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Whatever about complicated murders, there are many callous murders. There is a breakdown in the system. Will any special measures be included in the Criminal Justice Bill, which is on Committee Stage and which is being amended to deal with a number of issues, such as the intimidation of witnesses?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that new legislation is required to deal with these matters. I share the Deputy's concern about the latest murder, which appears to be a gangland killing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has introduced amendments to the Bill which is currently before the House in relation to the intimidation of witnesses. I am not certain if other amendments are necessary. If so, I am sure they will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The legislation relating to insanity and the Mental Health Bill appear to be interlinked and may be delaying each other. There has been coverage in recent days of the case of a person who was found to be criminally insane and committed to Dundrum, but who is now out on day release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to increase the amount because £400,000 is niggardly in the context of the enormous humanitarian catastrophe which has arisen? Is the Tánaiste concerned about the fact that NATO has started to <Col N="213" /> bomb civil targets, such as water supplies, sewerage treatment plants and bridges? This is a direct attack on the people of Serbia as distinct from the military capacity of Mr. Milosevic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Kosovo was discussed at the European summit and the debate later will give Deputies an opportunity to comment on it. If a Supplementary Estimate is required, it will be brought forward. I understand the total sum is £600,000. There are two different amounts, one of £400,000 and another of £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

        <b>:</b> Does the Tánaiste agree that the individuals who deal with people with disabilities deserve more compliments than the Minister for securing the Special Olympics for Ireland? I am not criticising the wonderful Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, but the individuals concerned fought valiantly and succeeded in ensuring that the Special Olympics will be held in Ireland.

    <Title>European Summit: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Taoiseach is involved in important business in Northern Ireland and, therefore, I am reading this Dáil statement on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I attended the Special European Council in Berlin on 24 and 25 March, together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. This was the second time the Heads of State or Government had met during the German Presidency to consider the future financial perspective for the Union. The first meeting, the informal Petersberg Summit in February, presented a key challenge to the Presidency in terms of progressing the complex issues contained with the Agenda 2000 portfolio within relatively tight budgetary parameters. I am happy to say that sufficient progress was made on foot of the orientations coming from Petersberg to allow an agreement to be forged in Berlin.</P>
      <P>We also decided on our nominee as new President of the European Commission; we adopted statements on Kosovo and the Middle-East and we approved a trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa. Overall and for the reason which I will point out in the course of my statement, I believe that the summit was a success for Europe and for Ireland in particular.</P>
      <P>I will begin by outlining the format of the European Council. Proceedings opened last Wednesday morning with a meeting with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Gil-Robles, where there was a useful exchange of views on the process for the appointment of the new Commission and the issues arising under Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>A detailed discussion of the recent resignation of the Commission took up most of the first working session of the European Council. It resulted in the decision to nominate Mr. Romano Prodi to be the next President of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The emerging situation in Kosovo was discussed during our working lunch that day. Detailed negotiations on Agenda 2000 formed the major part of our afternoon working session and indeed the rest of the summit. However, as Deputies will understand, given the currency of the Kosovo situation this was an issue which featured frequently in our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the agreement negotiated on Agenda 2000. This is not a deal that was agreed in two days of hard negotiations in Berlin. Rather, it is the culmination of a process that began in July 1997 with the presentation by the Commission of its policy document of Agenda 2000. Intensive negotiations were conducted at a technical and political level. This involved the Agricultural Council, the ECOFIN Council and, in an overall <Col N="218" /> co-ordinating role, the General Affairs Council, thus preparing the grounds for agreement at the level of Heads of State or Government.</P>
    <P>In parallel with this I engaged in an intensive round of bilateral meetings with my European counterparts and the Commission &ndash; highlighting the particular objectives of Ireland in the negotiations. In a period of 11 months, beginning in late April of last year, I visited Finland, Austria, France twice, the UK, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium. Each visit was undertaken specifically to discuss Agenda 2000 and ensure that Ireland's approach was well understood by its partners and the Commission. I believe that my initiative paid dividends; the agreement negotiated last week recognises the special situation of Ireland. On 19 March, I met with German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder as part of his tour of capitals in advance of Berlin. This last meeting allowed me the opportunity to prioritise Irish objectives for the Chancellor at a crucial stage in the preparations for Berlin. Key among those objectives was the maintaining intact of the agriculture package as negotiated at the Agriculture Council the previous week and the need to ensure a balanced outcome on Structural Funds which would take account of Ireland's particular situation.</P>
    <P>It is important to set the context in which we conducted our negotiations. We entered these negotiations having derived considerable benefit from our membership of the European Union. One measure of this is that since 1973, Ireland has received a cumulative net transfer of some £23.5 billion in receipts from the EU. Perhaps more importantly as an exporting nation, Ireland has greatly benefited from access to a Single Market which has now grown to over 370 million people. Our progress has not gone unnoticed by our partners and I assure the House it was raised with me at every bilateral meeting.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EEC in 1973, the Irish gross domestic product &ndash; GDP &ndash; per head approximated to 60 per cent of the EU average. While the gap had been halved by 1993, most of the convergence of the Irish figure towards that for the EU has taken place in the very short period since 1993. The nature of this rapid convergence needed to be recognised in judging the extent to which we have &ldquo;caught up&rdquo; with our partners. This was a point which my Government colleagues and I sought to emphasise in contacts with our counterparts.</P>
    <P>Relative to most of the EU, Irish infrastructure is underdeveloped. Even the Commission's own Sixth Periodic Report on Regional Policy and Cohesion recognised this fact, noting <i>inter alia</i> that Ireland has the least developed motorway network in the Union. The infrastructural gap represents a social and economic barrier to continued economic progress which will take both time and major resources to overcome. The Stability and Growth Pact, which requires countries to be in budgetary balance over the economic cycle, excludes systematic recourse to Government bor<Col N="219" /> rowing to meet these needs. Accordingly, I asked our partners in the Agenda 2000 negotiations to look beyond the very recent statistics on Irish economic growth and to recognise the underlying need for consolidation of our recent achievements in order to complete the convergence process.</P>
    <P>Any assessment of the deal struck in Berlin, which I will outline to the House, must take account of the context in which the final negotiation took place. The negotiations took place against a background of general budget retrenchment at EU level. This factor, and the reality of Ireland's economic prosperity, combined to ensure that Ireland would have to bear a significant cut in EU transfers in the period 2000 to 2006. Ireland has negotiated throughout the process on the basis of the Commission proposals, despite the deterioration in our budgetary position which they involved.</P>
    <P>However, in the final phase of negotiations, a number of developments gave rise to particular concern to Ireland. The debate on overall levels of EU expenditure was dominated by the suggestion, supported by a majority of member states, that EU expenditure should be stabilised in real terms.  This was compounded by the not unreasonable wish of the net contributor member states for a commitment to address what they regard as their excessive contribution to the EU budget.</P>
    <P>Ireland consistently resisted the tendency towards overall stabilisation, arguing that it failed to take adequate account of the implications of CAP reform or of the Treaty requirements on economic and social cohesion or of the financial implications of enlargement. Taken together, these factors created an unpromising situation as we went into the negotiations in Berlin. Nevertheless, I have no hesitation in asserting now that Ireland secured an excellent deal in difficult circumstances. The final outcome is one in which our key concerns, CAP reform and Structural Funds, were satisfactorily addressed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the resource side, Ireland was prepared to pay its fair share of the burden and, in this regard, contributed positively and constructively to the examination of ways to place the revenue side of the budget on a more equitable and transparent basis.</P>
    <P>The existing system of calculating EU budget contributions involves a number of different mechanisms which, in our view, are both unwieldy and lacking in transparency. The European Council decided that the Union's own resources ceiling should remain at the current level of 1.27 per cent of EU GNP. The maximum rate of call of the VAT resource will be reduced to 0.75 per cent in 2002 and to 0.50 per cent in 2004. Traditional own resources will be maintained, with the percentage retained by the member states in the form of collection costs increasing to 25 per cent with effect from 2001. Both the switch to GNP and higher retention of traditional <Col N="220" /> own resources were policy options favoured by Ireland. The UK rebate will remain with some technical adjustments made to neutralise windfall gains resulting from the progressive reduction of the VAT resource and from the increase in the percentage of traditional own resources retained by member states. In addition, it was agreed that on enlargement, an adjustment in the calculation of the UK rebate will be made to exclude from its scope an amount equivalent to the pre-accession aid for these countries.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the concerns of net contributors, the financing of the UK rebate by other member states will be modified to allow Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden to see a reduction in their financing share to 25 per cent of the normal share. The outcome on own resources was a good one from an Irish viewpoint bearing in mind the concerns of the net contributors and the domestic political pressure in the United Kingdom not to concede on the rebate.</P>
    <P>Ireland's budget contribution will rise over the period largely in line with GNP growth but the estimated effect of the changes agreed will be to reduce Ireland's contribution to the EU budget over the period by some 40 million euros as compared to what it otherwise would be. The own resources system will be reviewed before end-2005, taking account of the effects of englargement. Ireland will still be a substantial net beneficiary in 2006 but on present trends and assuming enlargement goes ahead, Ireland may become a net contributor during the EU multi-annual budget round commencing in the year 2007.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has enabled Irish agriculture to transform and modernise over the past two and a half decades while also helping to preserve our rural communities. Agriculture continues to contribute 6 per cent of our GDP, more than three times the EU average. On top of that, two of the sectors being reformed, beef and milk, account for about 70 per cent of Irish agricultural output. This level of dependence on two agricultural sectors is unique in the EU and we argued this should be reflected in the eventual package.</P>
    <P>In entering the latest round of negotiations in Berlin, I was determined to ensure that the detail of the agreement reached at the Agriculture Council would not be modified to our disadvantage. I was very pleased that we achieved this objective.</P>
    <P>In order to stabilise agricultural expenditure, the European Council decided on a number of measures. One of these is the postponement of the reform of the dairy sector from 2003 to 2005. Importantly, this is without prejudice to the decisions concerning the specific additional dairy quotas from which Ireland and only three other member states, as well as Northern Ireland, benefited.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to confirm that the Irish dairy quota will be increased by approximately 1.8 per cent from the marketing year 2000-01 and by a <Col N="221" /> further 1 per cent or so from 2001-02. Another measure decided by the European Council was that the intervention price for cereals will be reduced by 15 per cent in two equal steps of 7.5 per cent in the marketing years 2000-01 and 2001-02 and not by 20 per cent as originally decided.</P>
    <P>The Commission and the Council were also requested to pursue additional savings to ensure that total expenditure, excluding rural development and veterinary measures, in the 2000-06 period will not overshoot an average annual expenditure of 40.5 billion euros in real terms. Through skillful negotiation, together with a number of other member states, we managed to ensure that neither degressivity nor co-financing of the CAP featured in the final agreements.</P>
    <P>The net result of the agreement finalised in Berlin is that, over the period 2000-06, Irish agriculture will gain to the extent of 501.5 million euros, even assuming that market prices fall by the full amount of the reductions in support prices. On the same assumption, gains to the economy from lower prices on the domestic market are estimated at 344.1 million euros. Thus, the total gains to the Irish economy could amount to 845.6 million euros over the 2000-06 period.</P>
    <P>EU transfers to Ireland from the guarantee section of the agricultural fund will amount to 12.7 billion euros approximately over the period even before counting headage payments in disadvantaged areas, which from 2000 will be funded from the guarantee section and should amount to about 507.9 million euros over the seven year period. Overall, the agreement on agriculture represents a substantial achievement by the Government, which has been lauded by the various farm organisations.</P>
    <P>We are all very aware of the important contribution which the Structural and Cohesion Funds have made to the development of this country over recent years. They have facilitiated significant infrastructural investment and promoted the development of a range of programmes encompassing sectoral economic development, human resources and the fight against social exclusion. The Commission identified as a central theme of the Agenda 2000 reforms the need to improve the effectiveness of the Structural and Cohesion Funds in achieving the goal of economic and social cohesion. Structural Fund assistance would be concentrated on the areas of greatest need by, <i>inter alia</i>, a substantial reduction in the number of objectives to three.</P>
    <P>In Berlin the overall amount available for the Structural and Cohesion Funds over the period was set at 213 billion euros. Of this, 18 billion euros will be allocated for the Cohesion Fund. Of the overall allocation for Structural Funds, it was agreed that 135.9 billion euros would be allocated to Objective One, including transitional support; 22.5 billion euros for Objective Two, including transitional support; and 24.05 billion euros for Objective Three.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a very positive outcome, in particular against the background of the intensive <Col N="222" /> pressure from a majority of member states, which emerged at the informal meeting of Heads of State of Government in Petersberg, Bonn, in late February in favour of a significantly lower volume of resources for structural operations. In this context, I emphasised and, not without difficulty, secured recognition of the need for adequate transitional support to address Ireland's ongoing infrastructural requirements.</P>
    <P>On the Cohesion Fund, Ireland supported the Commission's proposals that the existing Cohesion four should retain entitlement subject to a mid-term review. We achieved this aim despite strong pressure from some member states for an earlier review in 2002 or even annual reviews. It was also agreed that in calculating Cohesion Fund share-out, account should be taken of real convergences in GNP terms by individual member states. Because of the much better performance of the Irish economy in recent years this factor will act to depress our Cohesion Fund receipts over the period to 2004. While all regions of the country are sharing in the present period of growth, regional disparities still exist. The poorest regions have incomes below the EU threshold for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>The distribution of population growth across the regions also indicates a considerable lagging behind of economic development in certain parts of the country. These regions are also the most dependent on agriculture. The Government decided in November last to pursue a policy aimed at maintaining part of the country as an Objective One region. On foot of this decision, the Government submitted an application to EUROSTAT to change the current single NUTS II status of the country into two NUTS II regions. Our proposal to regionalise the country was accepted, albeit in a modified form. This ensured that the Border, midland and west regions will continue to enjoy full Objective One status over the whole of the next round. The additional amount of Structural Funds arising from this is 590 million euros, a figure which of itself justifies the Government's strategy. Apart from the direct Structural Funds benefit, these regions will continue to be eligible for the highest level of State aid allowable under EU regulations.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the country will be treated as an Objective One region in transition for six years. We managed, through late night negotiations, to secure an additional 100 million euros in the form of a special phasing out allocation. This is particularly welcome as it underscores the Government's commitment to ensure that the problems of many of the poorer urban and rural areas in the transition period will continue to be addressed through targeted measures.</P>
    <P>All in all, we estimate that Ireland's share of Structural and Cohesion Funds will be around 4.25 billion euros. This includes headage payments now situated in Heading 1 of the budget and is a very commendable achievement in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> The task ahead of us is to utilise these funds, in conjunction with Exchequer and private funds, to produce a national development plan which meets the developmental and social needs of the country as it heads into the new millennium. This is now a most urgent priority of the Government.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's point of view another key outcome of the summit was the commitment for a continuation of EU support for the Northern Ireland peace process. This built upon the commitments we secured from the European Councils in Cardiff and Vienna. Together with Prime Minister Blair, I had sought to ensure that the level of EU Structural Fund support to Northern Ireland would be maintained at levels broadly comparable to those in the current funding period. The conclusion reached of a continuation in the PEACE programme for five years with funding of 500 million euros, of which 100 million euros will go to the Border counties, over the period was very satisfactory. In addition, following intensive lobbying by Ireland, the EU will make a contribution of 15 million euros per annum to the International Fund for Ireland over three years.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that the primary driving force for the Agenda 2000 package was the need to prepare the Union's finances and institutions for enlargement. It was very important that the Council took the opportunity to reassure the applicant countries of the Union's continuing commitment to the enlargement process. The recent focus on the Agenda 2000 package and the crisis in the Commission might have created the impression that the enlargement process was less of a priority for the Union. This is not so. Enlargement remains an historic priority for the European Union. The current crisis in Kosovo underlines once again the importance of Europe's economic, social and political integration project. The crisis highlights the need for a stable Union with stable borders and should reinforce our determination to remove barriers to the early integration of applicant states.</P>
    <P>We also took the opportunity to consider the recent resignation of President Santer and the entire European Commission. It was unanimously agreed to ask Mr. Romano Prodi, the former Italian Prime Minister, to accept the position of President of the next European Commission. I fully share the satisfaction of all my colleagues in the European Council that a candidate of proven stature who has demonstrated his commitment to Europe will assume the responsibility of leading the Commission in the months and years ahead. I have no doubt that, with the support of the Heads of State or Government, he will be able to reform, modernise and equip the Commission to discharge effectively its vital role in the European Union. Like other member states, Ireland continues to look to the Commission to be the engine which drives the Union forward. I shall be very happy to work closely with Mr. Prodi, initially on <Col N="224" /> the formation of the new Commission and later on the challenges which we must all face together.</P>
    <P>As to the steps to be taken in the short-term, in line with the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty which is due to come into force on 1 May, this decision was communicated to the European Parliament. After his approval by the Parliament, Mr. Prodi will begin to prepare the nomination of a new Commission in co-operation with the Governments of member states. The Governments of the member states shall, by common accord with Mr. Prodi, nominate those whom they intend to appoint as members of the Commission. Following the European Parliament elections in June, the newly elected Parliament will give its approval to both the President and the nominees for the Commission.</P>

      <P>It is intended that Mr. Prodi will have a first exchange of views with the Heads of State or Government on a reform programme for the Commission at an informal working dinner in Brussels on 14 April.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that the Council reached agreement on a trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa which had been under negotiation for some time. I was very keen to see this agreement finalised and have consistently supported the early conclusion of a generous agreement. It sends a very strong signal of our commitment to South Africa and, in particular, to Nelson Mandela as he prepares to leave office.</P>
      <P>The developing situation in Kosovo was a large focus of attention during the summit. During the summit, two statements were agreed on the situation in Kosovo. The first was agreed before the air strikes and urged President Milosevic to sign the Rambouillet peace agreement. The second statement was agreed following the commencement of air strikes and asked President Milosevic to reconsider his refusal to sign the peace agreement. The Irish Government, while not a party to NATO's decision to undertake air strikes, recognises the humanitarian crisis which prompted it. Ultimately, as we have seen on our island, only a return to negotiations will solve this regional conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heads of State and Government also took some time to discuss the current status of the Middle East peace process in light of the stated intention of the Palestinians to make an unilateral declaration of independence on 4 May. We reiterated our support for a negotiated settlement in the Middle East to reflect certain basic principles including that of land for peace and called upon the parties to implement fully and immediately <Col N="225" /> the Wye River Memorandum. In addition, we broke new ground in two areas. First, we called for an early resumption of what are known as the final status negotiations and expressed the belief that it should be possible to conclude these negotiations within a target period of one year. Second, we reaffirmed the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination &ndash; and this is a significant innovation &ndash; including the option of a state. We declared our readiness to consider the recognition of such a state in due course in accordance with the basic principles set out in the conclusions. Having visited the region earlier this year, I believe that this is a progressive step for the Union which the Irish Government fully supports.</P>
    <P>While attending the summit, as well as conducting discussions and negotiations on the key European issues which I have outlined, I took the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair to discuss current developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government was pleased with the outcome of the summit. We were tough in our negotiations but realistic in our expectations. Our partners were likewise and an equitable outcome was achieved. This agreement marks an important step in the development of the Union and in Irish attitudes to and relations with our partners and the Union's institutions. All member states, whether net recipients or contributors, were forced to compromise in the course of negotiations and agree a deal that will be to the benefit of all the people of the Union and those countries which are due to join the Union over the coming years. We should be grateful for the past and continued support of our partners while being justly proud of the progress we have made using our own resources and the talents of our people.</P>
    <P>I want Chancellor Schröder and the Presidency team for their skilful handling of the negotiations. I also thank my Government colleagues and their officials for their sustained efforts over the entire course of these negotiations and for the positive outcome we achieved for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The summit declaration represents a blank cheque endorsement of NATO's actions. European foreign and security policy seems to consist of cheerleading others from the sidelines. No thought seems to have been given at the summit to the predictable humanitarian crisis which confronts the Balkans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Milosevic alone has caused this humanitarian crisis by unleashing murderous bands of Serb militia to terrorise Kosovars out of their homes. However, EU leaders have a responsibility to assist their fellow Europeans in Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro in coping with the crisis. Why were plans not put in place in Berlin? Must we watch people die on our television sets before we deliver on what is already a very serious problem? What is the Government's position on the Kosovo crisis? Does it simply support <Col N="226" /> the bombing or does it have any plan? What role, if any, is it playing in EU discussions on the issue? Is there a Plan B or does the Government have any plan in connection with this or similar issues? For a Government which is willing to travel the world seeking support for Ireland's election to the UN Security Council, its weakness and indecision during the crisis has been pitiful. I will return to this subject later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>I welcome Mr. Prodi's appointment as EU Commission President. I hope Government relations with the new Commission will not be damaged by the Taoiseach's comment in support of Mr. Prodi's rival, Mr. Wim Kok, when he spoke on radio recently. It was a naive and foolish comment on the part of the Taoiseach and I hope it will not be damaging to our long-term interests or to the portfolio that our Commissioner, when appointed, might get.</P>
    <P>The proposal accepted by the summit means that Mr. Prodi will have to be approved by the current European Parliament. He will then present himself and his team to the new Parliament after it is elected between 10 and 13 June. This will, in effect, extend the Commission's term by six months. It is vital that the new Commission is endorsed quickly to avoid further damage to it as an institution, particularly now that the Parliament is aware of its power. It is unacceptable to the citizens of the Union that the current caretaker Commission will continue in place for another three months, having resigned in the manner it did. It is an unsatisfactory solution which gives rise to concern.</P>
    <P>The key decision now is the early nomination of a politically skilled and experienced person as the new Irish nominee for the Commission. Has the Taoiseach revised his earlier view that this issue should be dealt with after the elections to the European Parliament? Does he not accept that if the Irish nominee is to be allocated a meaningful job in the Commission, the Taoiseach must open discussions with Mr. Prodi on the issue in the next couple of weeks?</P>
    <P>I welcome the deal on Agenda 2000 but wonder if it will last. Is the Berlin deal not just a fudge which will fall apart during the next round of the world trade talks due to start in January? The Minister referred to aid for urban blackspots. One element of the Berlin deal which has not attracted sufficient attention is the position of the 13 eastern and southern counties as Objective One areas in transition. These areas will suffer significant cuts in EU aid. A rocky landing rather than the promised smooth landing is now in prospect.</P>
    <P>There are important local development projects in areas such as north Cork city, Tallaght, the north inner city and areas in my constituency of the south inner city such as St. Theresa's Gardens, Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House, Bridgefoot Street, St. Michael's Estate and Cherry Orchard. How will these areas fare after the negotiations? From where will the funding for <Col N="227" /> partnership companies in these urban blackspots come?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say the farmers did well. I wish them well and it is good for the economy. However, why do we not have two strings to our bow? Why omit the urban dwellers in Dublin and other cities who will suffer badly due to the lack of local development funds? Will the Minister give a commitment that the Exchequer will ensure that these partnership companies, which are attempting to redress imbalances and injustices in society by trying to equip people to take a fairer role in society, will continue to be funded? The House must receive such an undertaking.</P>
    <P>It is time Members who represent difficult constituencies in this and other cities spoke up for these people in the same way other Members speak up for and achieve progress for other groups. These people are among the poorest citizens in this State and they are not considered in the summit report beyond a small paragraph and a throwaway comment on their future. We do not want comments. We want the type of undertakings other groups in society are getting.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the issue of Kosovo. EU leaders had comparatively little to offer beyond a statement broadly supportive of the NATO air strikes, despite clear indications that there is no clear view of where this plan will go. However, Ireland has no plan. That is not only in the case of Kosovo &ndash; we also sat out the Bosnian crisis. We disgrace ourselves when international security issues come up for debate by not having a position. Deputy De Rossa and I might not agree on what that position should be but at least we put forward ideas for consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government has no idea of its position beyond claiming to be caught between a rock and a hard place. This is the Government that is canvassing for a seat on the UN Security Council. It has no ideas, no comments and nothing to say about the most disastrous humanitarian crisis and security issue to arise in Europe since the Second World War. Why does the Government believe Ireland has no place in security matters? Does it believe it should seek a seat on the Security Council for prestige rather than to make a contribution?</P>
    <P>We have a long tradition in peacekeeping. We have something to bring to the table, something to offer. We are not a big state like France, Italy or Germany but Denmark, for example, has views on these matters. Many other small countries have views and it is time Ireland formulated its own views and plans. It is time the White Paper on foreign policy, which was drafted by the previous Government after a long period of discussion, was complemented by the promised White Paper on defence and security. It is time these documents were built on and for Ireland to take its role in these issues more seriously.</P>
    <P>We should have a plan and I wish to put forward some elements which might be included in <Col N="228" /> that plan, since nobody on the Government side of the House seems to have any ideas. My ideas are no more than that. I do not have available to me the ambassador to the OSCE or the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Government has these facilities and I hope that by being prodded with ideas it might play a more constructive and positive role at summits of this kind. It must stop shaming the country by keeping its head down and not making a contribution to the resolution of these issues.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not neutral in the sense of the definition contained in the fifth and 13th Hague conventions. These conventions require neutral states to deny assistance to all belligerents equally in times of conflict. Our neutrality does not measure up to that definition.</P>
    <P>The principle or principles upon which our neutrality is based have never been defined beyond the definition offered by Seán MacBride in 1949 that Ireland would become full charter members the day after partition ends. We might bear that definition in mind on a day when these issues are being discussed on another part of this island. That definition remains the basis of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Ireland sat out the Bosnian crisis despite repeated genocide. The paralysis of the Government to date in the Yugoslav conflict indicates that it intends to give a repeat performance. There is no policy. Ireland has cosigned a blank cheque without any understanding from or with NATO that NATO has a follow through plan. I wish to put forward ten ideas for consideration which might prod members of the Cabinet, who have responsibility in this area, to put together some ideas on what our contribution should be in trying to play a more proactive role in security matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>Ireland should bring forward the date for joining Partnership for Peace. It should not be left to the second part of this year. Members who believe in Partnership for Peace should be before the public putting the case for membership. There are people who do not agree with that policy and they will put forward their case. However, people who do believe in it have kept their heads down for too long and appear to be apologetic about it.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to leave this matter until after the European elections and somehow claim that because Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and others got so many seats that the people have endorsed the decision. The people do not know what it is about. Let us take the argument to the people and not wait until the second half of the year. We must bring this issue forward. It is time people who believe in the Partnership for Peace took on the argument and proactively sold it, not in a way that disrespects the views of other people but in a manner which asks others to respect our position and to debate and argue about where they believe we are wrong. Why should we hide and keep our heads down? That is no way to conduct security and foreign policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> In advance of joining Partnership for Peace, I call on the Government to appoint an ambassador to NATO. The Taoiseach told this House yesterday we will not appoint an ambassador to NATO. The day before, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said the same. I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he was sure about that because all the other European Union neutrals have done so. Switzerland, which joined Partnership for Peace, appointed its ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium, who is also Switzerland's ambassador to the Western European Union, as ambassador to NATO. As night follows day we will do the same because many PfP meetings will be held at ambassadorial level, and we have an ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium who is already ambassador to the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>We are not telling the people the truth if we tell them we are not appointing an ambassador to NATO. This will be another U-turn by the Government which will make the appointment later in the year despite what has been said here. It should be done openly so that the people will know about it. It should be done in advance of the European elections so that people can see what is happening on this issue.</P>
    <P>If we had an ambassador to NATO we could tell our views and the concerns expressed in this House to Javier Solana, an honourable man doing a job he believes in, with whom Deputy Spring worked when he was the Spanish socialist foreign minister. We have no way of doing that at present.</P>
    <P>We should actively campaign for the early transfer of the Petersberg Tasks type policy decisions in the area of peace-making, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. We should ask for those to be transferred to the EU without further delay. They are provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty. The people have voted on them so we would at least have some proactive role on the part of the European Union in which we could have an input in dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>Many EU states, most recently the British and the French, have proposed a defence policy and/or defence role for the European Union. If the ultimate outcome is assessed by Ireland as a likely merger of the EU and the Western European Union, we should seek now to influence the outcome of such evolution. Specifically, the Article 5 commitment of Western European Union full membership which obliges all member states to automatically come to the defence of another member state if attacked, could be made a protocol of any future merger agreement. This would mean that future Western European Union members could opt in or out of this automatic commitment. If others are allowed to make the policy, we may ultimately be left with fewer options to exercise in the medium to long-term future. Keeping our heads down, if we assess the situation as I suggest, is not in our best interests. We need to negotiate what is in our best interests <Col N="230" /> in case others set the rules and we are left only with the option of joining.</P>
    <P>We should explore a joint initiative with Denmark to advance its policy for a UN rapid deployment force, a state of high readiness brigade, SHIRBRIG, for deployment in UN mandated operations.</P>
    <P>We should initiate a debate on North-South security and defence issues in a healthy and open atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Following on the White Paper on Foreign Policy produced by the previous Government, the promised White Paper on security and defence issues should be published now and debated during the forthcoming European Parliament election campaign. That is the way it would be done in any democracy, so why can it not be done here? It is time we were mature enough to debate these issues. They can do it in Northern Ireland where the PUP, Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP, all of which have different views, can discuss issues. Why can those of us with different views not discuss security issues instead of pretending they do not exist and misleading the people?</P>
    <P>An Irish Government security council could be created. This might include the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence, our ambassadors to the EU, OSCE, the UN in Geneva and the UN in New York, the Council of Europe, the Western European Union and NATO, when appointed. This group could meet regularly to review international security issues and to propose policy options for Ireland to pursue.</P>
    <P>A plan to provide immediate humanitarian aid to Kosovar refugees to include providing facilities for them to come to Ireland, where appropriate, should be put in place. EU Ministers should meet immediately to co-ordinate such a response and Ireland should ask for a meeting.</P>
    <P>Through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our ambassadors abroad, we should set out to initiate an exchange of ideas on the effective action the European and international community can take to bring an end to the genocide and bring Mr. Milosevic to account.</P>
    <P>These are not exhaustive ideas but I put them forward in the hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs might take the best of all the ideas put forward. We must not leave this issue to other people. We have a contribution to make. If we leave it to others they may leave it to us and nothing will be done. Ireland has been neutered by Government inaction. I put forward these ideas in the hope that they might assist in overcoming our self-inflicted impotence.</P>
    <P>I support the comments by the Minister on enlargement but I would like to go further. We need the 12 applicants in the EU as much as they need to join. I accept there are new challenges facing us, not just institutional challenges but challenges as to the way we will accommodate these people around the table of the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the Parliament. <Col N="231" /> That has to be worked out, and already there are ideas on the table following the Amsterdam Treaty. There are economic challenges also. If we add together the GNP of all 12 applicant states it would probably total that of an existing medium-sized state like The Netherlands or Belgium. The challenges are unprecedented. There is also the challenge of the countries only now emerging as market economies and democracies.</P>
    <P>There is an unprecedented opportunity to fulfil the dream of the people who started us on the European Union enterprise when they pooled coal and steel resources in the hope there would never be war again. We can have an integrated Europe. We can bring those 12 states into the European Union and we can build peace and stability, the prerequisites to prosperity, and ensure there is not a repeat of the inheritance the generations in the first half of this century received when 60 million Europeans lost their lives in two world wars which started in Europe. The great opportunity is that of peace, stability and prosperity.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Government not to play cute on this. Let us have enlargement. Let us bring in those countries and share our prosperity with them because in the longer term it will be in the interests of our children and our grandchildren.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will open my contribution on the summit by referring to the Kosovan crisis. The Minister referred to Kosovo in his contribution, but there is a stark difference between the way he dealt with Kosovo and the reference to the Middle East peace process. He spoke at length, relatively speaking, on other issues about the Middle East process and had no difficulty in supporting the unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Kosovo we have weasel words yet again. Ultimately, as we have seen on our own island, only a return to negotiations will solve this regional conflict. We all know that but what is the Government's position now on the NATO bombing of Serbia and Kosovo? In particular, what is its attitude to the latest phase of NATO bombing, where NATO admits that it is bombing bridges, water supplies and sewage treatment facilities? These cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as military targets. NATO has consistently said that its target is Slobodan Milosevic and the degrading of his military capacity. What is being done now is bombing in a way which clearly indicates a scorched earth policy. It is trying to drive Serbia &ndash; and Kosovo, because the nature of the bombing is the same in Kosovo &ndash; back to the stone age. It is trying to obliterate any semblance or possibility of civilised living in that area. That cannot be supported by Ireland or by any European country, particularly as the stated objective of NATO is to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. What is obvious to everybody who watches their television screen is that the bombing has created the circumstance which it was <Col N="232" /> declared it was intended to avoid. It has created a humanitarian catastrophe, yet the bombing continues and Ireland is silent on its attitude.</P>
    <P>I have said here on a previous occasion that there are circumstances when the international community can and should intervene, where genocide is being pursued by a state against its own people or against a section of its own people. That choice should be made by the international community as a whole through the United Nations. I have argued that the current actions by NATO are illegal in international law. This is not a legal quibble in which I am engaged. It strikes at the very root of the nature of international security of the new world order which we all hoped would emerge following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall. We see a situation emerging where NATO, the most powerful military alliance on the face of the earth, is seeking to establish itself as the pre-eminent decision-maker as to who should intervene and where they should intervene in issues of conflict, whether they be internal or between states. That cannot be acceptable to a small country like Ireland. Ireland, as a small country, cannot survive in a world where individual regional groups or individual states take it on themselves to make decisions of this kind. We can only survive and prevent global warfare in a situation where we support the United Nations and seek where necessary to reform the charter of the United Nations to match the new situation in which we find ourselves in global affairs.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to get off the fence, to call for a stop to the bombing, to call for the restarting of negotiations, using whatever friends Serbia has left in the world as mediators in such negations. Serbia still has friends. Russia has clearly indicated that it does not want Serbia obliterated. Not just Russia, but Austria and others have also expressed views about the possibility that this war could ignite the whole Balkan region. If that happens, who knows where it will end? It is essential that Ireland as a small country with a view to express, as is clear in relation to other matters dealt with by the European Summit, should do so on this issue. It is not in our long-term interests to stay silent on this issue, either from a humanitarian point of view or from the point of view of being able to influence the nature of global security for the future.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the other day at Question Time, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Ireland was not and would never be a member of NATO. He also stated that the German authorities had indicated that the European Union should develop military arrangements to implement its responsibilities under the Amsterdam Treaty in relation to Petersberg Tasks but that the issue of mutual defence within the European Union was a matter for NATO. I asked the Minister then whether he agreed with this position of the German Government. If he does we are, either by default or by decision unstated, deciding that the European Union is not going to develop its own <Col N="233" /> defence capacity or its own common security position outside the context of NATO. If that is a decision that has been made by this Government, we should be told about it because it is mine and my party's view that membership of the European Union carries with it a responsibility to develop a common foreign and security policy and that it also implies a common defence policy and common defence.</P>
    <P>There is an issue there which the Government has not addressed publicly. It has gone off on what I would regard as a side-show in relation to Partnership for Peace. I have expressed my view on Partnership for Peace, as have other members of the Labour Party and members of other parties which are not united on that issue. It seems that if we take the two issues of Partnership for Peace, the Government's stated view on NATO and the Germans' stated view that common defence for the European Union should be through NATO, the only conclusion we can come to is that by joining Partnership for Peace the Government is seeking to soften us up in relation to accepting NATO, whether we join it or not, as the security architecture for Europe. I believe that is a wrong position and I will continue to argue against it.</P>
    <P>The bombing by NATO of Serbia and Kosovo is making a bad situation worse. It should stop and people should return to the negotiating table. We have had eight days of bombing. The very least that should happen is that we should be calling for a moratorium on bombing in order to give Serbia an opportunity to come to the table. I hope that point of view will prevail. I get the distinct feeling that the Department of Foreign Affairs has a clear view on this issue in relation to Kosovo, in relation to European security and in relation to NATO, and that the problem is that Fianna Fáil is acting in a cowardly way in relation to what it believes it should do and at the same time not wishing to alienate its supporters.</P>
    <P>On the summit itself and the financial package that was negotiated there, the emphasis on how much we can extract from the European Union in financial terms is a mistaken view. It is an old-fashioned view of our relationship to the European Union. We have been for 25 years a member of the European Union. We have held the Presidency of the Union and have been very successful in that job a number of times under various Administrations. Despite the disadvantage that to a large extent we still have in common and generally understood economic terms, we are a prosperous country, primarily because we are a member of the European Union and have had the benefit of the open market within the Union and investment from within and without the Union, plus the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>It is important therefore that we reassess how we approach our membership of the Union. If this Government or anybody else continues to see it solely in terms of the amount of money we can extract from it, we cannot blame the public at large for applying the same criterion. If that is the case, we will find that enthusiasm for membership <Col N="234" /> of the European Union will decline as EU contributions decline. That would be a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Government chose to go into the summit amid a sea of hype about how much it would extract. Government Ministers returned saying what great fellows they were, having managed to gain an extra £400 million or 500 million euros. Whether the Government likes it, that attitude is reflected by the fact that during the Minister's speech he referred entirely to euros. It is not because the Minster is such a Europhile that he will use no other term; it is because when one expresses the figures in euros rather than pounds they look far larger in terms of financial success. That is simply a reflection of a mind-set in relation to Europe, but it has to change. We must begin to talk to the public about having a different attitude to Europe. We must accept our share of the burdens of Europe as well as our share of the goodies which come from there, as we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that many of the social advances that have been made in Ireland, whether they relate to environmental issues, equal pay, women's rights, and working conditions, including health and safety issues, have been driven by the European Union and we have been obliged, by and large, to follow that trend. That has been good for Ireland because it has helped to modernise our industry and society. It would be a grave error to walk away from that simply because in five or six years' time the amount of money we get from Europe will be nil.</P>
    <P>I am interested to note that there is not a single reference in the Minister's speech to the possibility, post-2006 or 2007, that the current Objective One area &ndash; the western counties &ndash; will qualify for transitional funding. This was part of the argument made for dividing the country into two artificial regions some months ago but it has been abandoned. I argued at the time that it was not realistic and that not only was there no guarantee but that it was extremely unlikely that we would qualify for any of that money, or that the region would qualify for transitional funding after 2006 or 2007. I am still of that view and the Government has clearly come to that conclusion also because there was no reference to it in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining, I want to deal briefly with a number of issues, including the national plan. The Government has a packet of money under its belt from Cohesion, Structural and farm funds. It is essential that we plan the use of that money in a way which will ensure that there is infrastructural development of a high order in order so that our prosperity and economic growth continues. If we do not provide the infrastructure that growth will start to decline and as a result we will not be in a position to benefit in future.</P>
    <P>There is a need for enormous infrastructural development but there is also a need for real regional development. One of the reasons I so strongly opposed the idea of dividing the country <Col N="235" /> into two artificial economic regions was that I felt it enabled the Government to abandon any real regional development policy. The eight regions we currently have are based around centres of population. Anyone with knowledge of regional policy knows that if one is to develop those regions one must create dynamic economic development hubs. To create the two regions that have been created and to apply money from Europe and national funds to them will result in a dispersal of funds rather than in their concentration that is necessary to develop both urban and rural areas. It is an issue we should return to in the House. We should have a debate on the national plan when the Government has produced it in draft form and before it is finalised. The expertise and knowledge of Deputies should be drawn upon in terms of how the plan will be finalised.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the issue of the President of the European Commission and the appointment of the Commission. The choice of Mr. Prodi was an inspired one. He will have a grasp of the issues and the need to develop the Union along social as well as economic lines. Ireland must ensure that the European Union never becomes simply a free trade area because if it does we will lose out. We have to ensure that the social principles which we negotiated in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty are fully respected and implemented. Otherwise small countries like ours on the periphery of the European Union will suffer.</P>
    <P>The Government should seek to ensure that the European Parliament is allowed to use the procedures under the Amsterdam Treaty for the appointment of the President of the European Commission and the Commissioners. Legally the terms of the Amsterdam Treaty may not be fully applicable at that point, but in so doing it would certainly be a gesture in acknowledging the rights of the European Parliament and the extraordinary circumstances that gave rise to the appointment of a new Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's statement we had a comprehensive report on the outcome of the Berlin European Council.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I wish to say that on Agenda 2000 the outcome of the Berlin summit was a satisfactory one both for the European Union as a whole and for Ireland. When Germany took over the Presidency in January, the German Government was faced with the onerous task of ensuring a successful conclusion of these lengthy and complex negotiations within the agreed deadline of the end of March. That it did so within the agreed timetable is a significant achievement and one on which it is to be warmly congratulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall our gratitude to the preceding Austrian and UK presidencies for the important contri<Col N="236" /> bution they made to preparing the way for final agreement.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 negotiations involved both the Agriculture Council and the ECOFIN Council, as well as the General Affairs Council which was responsible for co-ordinating the negotiations and preparing an overall package for consideration by Heads of State or Government. I pay tribute to Mr. Karl-Heinz Funke for the effective and competent manner in which he, as President, organised the work of the Agriculture Council and I compliment the President of the General Affairs Council, Mr. Joschka Fischer, on the excellent work he did in ensuring that overall co-ordination was successfully executed.</P>
    <P>The agreement reached at Berlin on Agenda 2000 constitutes an important package of policy reforms and a financial framework to achieve them over the next seven years and will ensure that the Union is in a position to face the challenges of the forthcoming period and to make a success of its future enlargement.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance pointed out, the negotiations took place in a context of continued EU budget retrenchment, majority support for overall stabilisation of EU expenditure in real terms and the insistence by the net contributors that the imbalance in their contributions be addressed. Against that background, it was never going to be easy to secure our objectives in these negotiations. Notwithstanding these difficulties, I am satisfied that we reached a balanced and equitable agreement in which the concerns of all member states were addressed and to which all member states contributed. From Ireland's point of view, it also represents the satisfactory culmination of a concerted effort to ensure that our essential concerns would be addressed in a realistic and balanced manner.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the outcome have already been outlined in the Taoiseach's statement. However, I refer in particular to the agreement on agriculture. The results of the negotiations on CAP were particularly gratifying to me and extremely beneficial to Irish agriculture. When the Commission published its detailed proposals in March 1998, my Department estimated that they would involve losses of £226 million a year to Irish farmers after their full implementation in 2003. For technical reasons, that estimate has since had to be adjusted marginally upwards to £233 million. The changes to the Commission proposals negotiated in Brussels, together with the adjustments agreed in Berlin, have reduced that loss to £14 million in the first year after all changes have been phased in and this will not now occur until 2007 &ndash; an improvement of £219 million a year. In fact, the £233 million loss was estimated in March 1998 necessarily on the basis of the annual average value of output over the years, 1995, 1996 and 1997. If the more up to date database now available of 1996, 1997 and 1998 was taken, the result is a gain of £7 million a year in 2007 and thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> However, the outcome of the agreement on agriculture is far more beneficial than these figures suggest. Over the seven year period, 2000-2006, of the EU's new financial framework, the gains to Irish farmers from the agreement will amount to £395 million. This compares with a loss of £1,386 million which would have accrued over the period from the Commission's proposals and represents a turnaround of £1.8 billion &ndash; a major achievement which will have a profoundly beneficial effect on Irish agriculture and on the farm families dependent on it.</P>
    <P>In addition, there will be gains to the economy from lower prices. These gains are estimated at £271 million over the period. When these are added to the gains to agriculture, the total gain to the Irish economy from the agreement finally concluded in Berlin last week is £666 million. The challenge to everybody, particularly the Government and its agencies, will be to ensure that the gain to the economy is passed on to consumers to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>These estimates of the gains to Irish farmers assume that market returns to farmers will fall fully in line with the reductions agreed in the support prices. That is not necessarily so and it is my intention that it will not be so. To the extent that this does not happen, the gains to Irish agriculture will be even greater than £395 million. I am happy that, in the agreement reached, the Taoiseach's and my own major objective of fully protecting the interests of Irish agriculture and Irish farmers has been met. I believe there is scope for the agricultural sector to make even further gains from the deal that has been concluded. Now that the broad policy direction has been set and the foundation for future progress has been laid, we must not waste the opportunities. It will be my intention to challenge farmers, processors and the supporting State agencies to make gains through further improvement in efficiency, higher quality standards and a better marketing effort all round. The clear objective is to secure the best possible prices for Irish food in export markets and the best return to the economy from those markets. I will be outlining in depth my plans in this regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>On Structural Funds also, the overall outcome takes due account of our key concerns. It provides for adequate transitional support in terms of volume and duration for those regions coming out of Objective 1 status. The objective of the reclassification of the country into two NUTS II regions with one retaining Objective 1 status has been secured. The message that transitional support would be essential to address our ongoing infrastructural needs and to copperfasten our relatively recent economic progress was successfully conveyed. We have also secured continued eligibility for the Cohesion Fund, at least until a mid-term review in 2003, against strong opposition from several member states that participation in the euro should be a bar to continued <Col N="238" /> eligibility and that reviews of eligibility should take place on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>We are also extremely grateful to receive continued EU support for the peace process. It is fitting at such a critical juncture in the peace process that we should be reminded of the consistent support which the EU has offered in this area and which it continues to offer. I am sure I reflect the views of all Members when I emphasise the importance we attach to that support and put on record our deep gratitude for this act of solidarity.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach set out the broad lines of the declaration by Heads of State or Government on the appointment of the President of the Commission. The House has already expressed its satisfaction with the nomination of Mr. Romano Prodi to be the next President of the Commission. This reflects the widely shared perception that Mr. Prodi has the qualities necessary to enable the Commission to exercise its prerogatives under the Treaty with the full confidence of the Governments of the member states and of the other institutions of the Union, including the European Parliament. It is of great importance for the Union and not least for Ireland that the Commission's vital role in the Union's structures should be rapidly reclaimed after the setback of recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Mr. Prodi was the unanimous choice of the Heads of State or Government to be the new Commission President precisely because he combines political stature and economic expertise with the character traits necessary to command respect in reforming and revitalising the Commission. A first exchange of views between the Heads of State or Government and Mr. Prodi on the way in which the new Commission shall work will take place in Brussels on 14 April.</P>
    <P>Some precision on the timeframe for the various steps outlined in the Declaration from Berlin should begin to emerge at that point and subsequently. Following the Treaty of Amsterdam procedures, the Presidency immediately communicated Mr. Prodi's nomination to the European Parliament for approval. It requested that the Parliament give its vote on the nominated candidate in time to enable the members of the Commission to be appointed as soon as possible, in order to ensure that a new Commission can start work at an early date. The Government shares this sentiment. The European Council has further stated that, after his approval, Mr. Prodi should strive to prepare the nomination of a new Commission as soon as possible, in co-operation with the Governments of the member states.</P>
    <P>In line with the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Governments of the member states shall, by common accord with Mr. Prodi, nominate the other persons they intend to appoint as members of the new Commission. The process of consultations which this implies is entirely new, and it strengthens the hand of the Commission President, and through him of the European Parliament, in potentially important ways as yet uncharted.</P>
    <P>An understanding will need to be developed <Col N="239" /> between the Heads of State or Government and Mr. Prodi, in co-operation with the President of the European Parliament, on how the various steps which the Heads of State or Government must, for the first time, take by common accord with Mr. Prodi as their nominee for Commission President, will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The European Council also wished to enable the new Commission to start work at the earliest opportunity and to continue with a mandate for a full five year term from January 2000. It stated that the new elected European Parliament should start the procedure for appointing the new Commission as early as July. The increased involvement of the European Parliament under the Amsterdam Treaty will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Commission. The new requirement that the European Parliament approve the Governments' nominee for the Commission Presidency indirectly enlarges also the Parliament's role in the approval of the nominees for the Commission.</P>
    <P>Member state Governments, including the Irish Government, are determined that the appointment of a new Commission should spur reform of the functioning of this key EU institution. The Government fully endorses the statement by the European Council that the new Commission should speedily put the necessary reforms into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share some of my time with Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>
      <P>The importance of the issues being addressed in today's debate cannot be overestimated. These issues are some of the most fundamental affecting our society. We are considering where our growing population will live and how people will get from their homes to work, to school and to other amenities which are central to our quality of life.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the challenges that lie ahead. Rapid economic growth has telescoped these challenges so that even though we have doubled housing output in four years we know that more than 200,000 additional houses will be required over the next five years. These must be planned for and the necessary infrastructure put in place to ensure that bottlenecks are avoided as far as possible in relation to key factors, particularly serviced land. It is necessary not only to build the houses but to do so in a planned and integrated fashion providing the necessary transport infrastructure and amenities in order to form viable new communities or integrate new housing successfully into existing communities. The decisions about where this housing is to be built and how best to manage this process are fundamental, both to our future economic success and to the kind of society we wish to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> The debate is very timely because the Government is bringing forward a range of developments covering housing, transport and strategic planning which are complementary and which require integrated thinking and implementation both within my Department and between my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise. The Government, in its recent statement, Action on the Housing Market following the second Bacon report, clearly placed the range of measures the Government is taking to secure balance in the housing market both within an immediate and a longer term perspective of strategic development.</P>
    <P>In the past, strategic planning has tended to be treated almost as the academic end of development policy. This has contributed to a disproportionate amount of our population being concentrated in the Dublin area. The capital has tended to sprawl, making efficient and cost-effective public services &ndash; especially public transport &ndash; very difficult to achieve and community identities hard to preserve. At the same time, some towns outside the greater Dublin area have stagnated to a degree. We cannot afford to allow this unplanned and unconsidered approach to continue. Unless we now implement an effective development strategy, unbalanced development of the Dublin area will impose a heavy cost, both economically and socially. Moreover, the progress we are now making to increase the supply of land for housing in the Dublin area will be largely eroded in five or six years if demand for housing is not more evenly distributed in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>Therefore, strategic planning guidelines, launched by the Government last week, will form the basis of a development strategy for the overall Dublin and mid east area. We will ensure that the strategy in the regional guidelines is implemented effectively at sub-regional level by local authorities through their development plans. We have also indicated agreement in principle with the recommendation in the second Bacon report to draw up a national spatial development strategy which will help the formulation of policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recently published ESRI report on national investment priorities for the period 2000-2006 and particularly its recommendations regarding the priority to be afforded investment in public physical infrastructure. The recommendations regarding investment in social housing and roads, public transport and sanitary services are already being reflected in the Government's policies to date and will remain at the top of the priority list for investment in the forthcoming national development plan.</P>
    <P>Housing is the key part of this strategic approach. The challenge facing this Government is to provide sufficient housing that is affordable, available to people at the tenure of their choice and make a positive contribution to the built environment and the building of communities. We have to deliver on all these needs at a time <Col N="241" /> of unprecedented demand for housing. The Government has faced this challenge head on and has actively sought to increase housing supply where it is needed and in ways that ensure access to adequate housing for those unable to afford it from their own resources. No one is under any illusions about the difficulties of this task. The housing market inherited by the Government left us with much to do. However, we have risen to the challenge, taken the necessary actions and the indications are that those actions are now bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>The Government's Action on House Prices, launched last April, was designed to curb serious overheating in the housing market and put in place measures to secure continued increase in housing supply. Further important initiatives have been undertaken since then, including a new section 23 type scheme for student accommodation, the new urban renewal scheme, a new local authority affordable housing scheme, the publication of draft planning guidelines on residential density and the strategic planning guidelines for Dublin and the mid east region.</P>
    <P>We announced a further range of initiatives in the housing market on 9 March in response to a second report on the housing market by Dr. Peter Bacon. The Government's response to that report sets out how all the various measures and initiatives that have been taken in the past year will, taken together, play a major role in helping to secure house price stabilisation, an adequate supply of housing and balanced development in the future.</P>
    <P>The overall policy framework within which all these housing measures are being pursued incorporates three key objectives: to secure sustained house price stabilisation as quickly as possible through accelerating housing supply; to target key issues, notably housing affordability and the role of the private rented sector; and to provide an effective strategy for development in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is unequivocally on measures to maximise and accelerate housing supply. This in turn necessitates ensuring that land is made available for housing as quickly as possible by removing infrastructural constraints. Furthermore, where developments are proposed they must not be delayed unnecessarily by bottlenecks in the planning system which have arisen from the extraordinary levels of growth throughout our economy.</P>
    <P>With historically high levels of new housing output we have been using up our supply of serviced land at unprecedented rates. The Government, under the serviced land initiative, is providing £39 million to assist projects costing about £100 million to provide serviced land for housing and thereby to remove this crucial bottleneck. The balance of the cost is to come from local authority contributions funded mainly from development levies.</P>
    <P>A total of 161 water and waste water projects has been approved under the initiative in two tranches which will provide serviced sites for more than 100,000 housing units, equivalent to <Col N="242" /> two and a half years additional housing supply. I intend that the vast bulk of these additional sites will be delivered between this year and next. My Department continues to press for progress on the initiative and five schemes have already been completed. Ten schemes are at construction. A further 74 schemes are at advanced planning stage and will provide around 40,000 sites when completed. I expect the majority of these to be completed this year.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to ensure that there is adequate serviced land available for housing. It is also vitally important to maximise the potential of this land. This necessitates appropriate levels of residential density which will secure the efficient use of serviced development land and, at the same time, further the objectives of sustainability and help reduce the problem of commuter-generated traffic congestion, especially in the Dublin area. The recently published planning guidelines on residential density will make a major contribution to securing these objectives. Local authorities have been asked to implement them, even in their draft form, and I emphasise that they and An Bord Pleanála will be obliged under law to have regard to the guidelines when they are formally issued.</P>
    <P>To cope with rapidly changing developments in the housing market it is essential for proper monitoring and policy evaluation of the housing situation to be carried out on a regular basis. I have asked the major financial and mortgage lending institutions to provide my Department with provisional house price data on a monthly basis. This will provide a more immediate indication of market trends and will complement the Department's wideranging compilation of associated data, much of which is published in the quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins. The results of the monthly analysis of house price trends will be made available to all co-operating lending institutions. This type of information and analysis will assist my Department to counter any adverse developments in the housing market and to assess the effectiveness of the current measures being undertaken.</P>
    <P>Preliminary indications received to date for the first two months of 1999 show reductions between January and February in house prices in Dublin, for both new and second hand houses. This latest information supports my Department's &ndash; and indeed Dr. Bacon's &ndash; analysis that the rate of house price increase has peaked and should moderate significantly this year. New house completions in January were up on last January's completions. With record planning permissions granted for houses in 1998 &ndash; up over one third on the previous year's total &ndash; and significant increases in home bond registrations in 1998 and in the first two months of 1999, all the indications point to another good year in terms of housing output. Housing output last year set another new record at over 42,000 units and the hope is that we can surpass that again this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> The increased price of houses over recent years has, however, inescapably resulted in some households of modest income, who might previously have bought their own house, now believing they are priced out of the housing market. However, it is important that aspiring first-time buyers are not discouraged by the average house prices. Average house prices, whether new or second hand, include many houses sold to people on significantly above average incomes.</P>
    <P>The first-time purchasers market is different. There continues to be large numbers of houses available at less than the average house price and first-time buyers are finding them. The average price paid by a first-time buyer is in the order of £85,000 to £90,000. This compares with an average new house price of £106,500 and an average second-hand house price of £116,400 for the December 1998 quarter, according to my Department's published data.</P>
    <P>Measures introduced under last year's action on house prices are helping to assist affordability for lower income house buyers, particularly through withdrawal of investor incentives, reduced stamp duty which has improved liquidity in the second-hand market and improvements in the local authority shared ownership scheme. Further innovative approaches to the issue of housing affordability are now being pursued, including the promotion of a better mix of affordable type units in new developments and the recently launched local authority affordable housing scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the new affordable housing scheme, local authorities will provide additional new houses on land available to them in or near centres where house prices have created an affordability gap for lower income house purchasers. The houses will be offered for sale to eligible purchasers at cost price and, accordingly, at a significant discount from the market value of comparable houses in the area. Purchasers will be offered mortgage finance at favourable interest rates and a subsidy will reduce further mortgage repayments for households with incomes of up to £16,000. While the primary emphasis of the scheme will be on urban centres where house price increases have been most marked, I am conscious that there are other areas where particular factors such as demand for holiday homes have created an artificial market and where local authorities might usefully intervene to provide affordable housing under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme will bring an additional dimension to Government efforts to address the problems that have developed in the housing market. An essential element of the scheme is that it is directly linked to the delivery of additional new houses by local authorities and will, therefore, not adversely affect house prices. A number of local authorities are already developing proposals which will fit into the new scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not selling this scheme as the solution to all the problems faced by aspiring first time buy<Col N="244" /> ers. It is, however, an important new initiative to help bridge the affordability gap which rapid house price increases over the past few years have created for many aspiring purchasers. Any measures that would fuel demand through, for example, increased availability of mortgage finance or increased new house grants without a corresponding increase in supply would undo the progress that has been made and inevitably cause renewed price escalation.</P>
    <P>The development of suitable sites, including where necessary the acquisition of land and the planning and construction of houses, will, of necessity, require some time to arrange. Nevertheless, I hope some 400 houses may be provided under the scheme this year and between 1,000 and 2,000 houses in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the increased level of social housing needs. A combination of house price rises, increases in the numbers of Irish people returning from abroad and changing demographic trends has and will continue to have an impact on the numbers requiring assistance from the State in meeting their housing needs.</P>
    <P>The Government has responded by increasing Exchequer expenditure on housing from £220 million in the 1997 Estimates, agreed before this Government took office, to £320 million in the 1999 Estimates. This is an increase of 45 per cent in expenditure in two years. The local authority housing programme has been increased to its highest level in years. Investment in 1999 will be four times greater than in 1993. Indeed, I secured increases of 18 per cent for the programme in each of the past two years. This high level of funding will enable local authorities to meet commitments on their ongoing programmes and to fund the enhanced programme of 4,500 new starts in 1999. The substantially increased capital provision for this year is testament to the Government's commitment to local authority housing as the mainstay of the overall response to social housing needs. I am currently considering how we can enable the local authority housing programme to be even more responsive to identified needs in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am also consulting with voluntary housing bodies to ascertain how significantly increased output from the sector can be achieved over the next few years. I believe that the voluntary housing sector has the capacity with proper support to provide some 4,000 to 5,000 units of accommodation per year and my efforts will be directed towards putting the necessary supports and financial assistance in place to deliver this target.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for housing, I significantly increased the levels of grant assistance available under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme on two occasions. Since the inception of the scheme these increases of up to 67 per cent represented the most significant increases ever made in the level of assistance. I also greatly increased the levels of grant available under the disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant schemes, with the effective <Col N="245" /> maximum disabled person's grant up from £8,000 to £12,000 and the effective essential repairs grant up from £1,800 to £4,500. The essential repairs grant scheme has also been extended to urban areas, a very significant change.</P>
    <P>I have significantly increased funding for the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly to bring its funding in 1999 to £6 million, the highest level ever. I and my Department continually press local authorities to respond better to housing needs in their own areas by developing the full potential of the range of social housing and voluntary housing measures now available to them.</P>
    <P>A cross-Department team has been established, which is chaired and serviced by my Department, to prepare an integrated response to the many problems which affect homeless people, including matters relating to accommodation, health, education and employment. We have also provided £1 million for the very first &lsquo;foyer' for homeless persons. &lsquo;Foyers' are specifically designed and managed to provide both accommodation and training opportunities for young homeless persons. The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, which I brought through the House last year, will ensure that housing authorities provide a planned, integrated and comprehensive response to the accommodation needs of travellers.</P>
    <P>Area based initiatives where the redevelopment of housing is the focus for the social and economic regeneration of the area as a whole are under way in Ballymun, in a number of Dublin inner-city flat complexes, in Rahoon and Ballinasloe in Galway and in a number of estates in Cork. Some £21 million is being provided by Government this year to assist the Ballymun regeneration programme and £6.5 million to assist the inner city flat complexes redevelopment in Dublin. The redevelopment works in Rahoon have a total cost of £15 million and the redevelopment at St. Grellan's Terrace in Ballinasloe will cost in excess of £2 million. These are just some examples of a wide range of initiatives to restore the physical fabric of established areas and to support local communities which are a vital aspect of the housing programme and significant resources have been devoted to them.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a range of effective actions are being taken by the Government across the housing spectrum. I acknowledge problems exist. However, we have systematically addressed these problems and the results are beginning to become apparent. Some of the measures will, by their nature, take longer to bear fruit than others. I will continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis the development of further measures that may be appropriate. The Government's housing strategy is multi-faceted, combining a number of programmes of action together to form an integrated response. It is comprehensive, adequately funded and subject to proper political direction by the Government. Housing is high on the priority list of this Government and will remain that way. <Col N="246" /> There should be no doubt that increased investment in housing infrastructure to secure and release land for housing and public transport will be key elements in the forthcoming National Development Plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on these important issues and thank the Minister of State for sharing time with me. Fundamental decisions are being made and need to be made about the future development of Dublin city and its suburbs. Many problems, which will be mentioned during the debate, have been created by our huge economic success. Nobody could have foreseen that the economy would grow so quickly. As a result, many people have returned to Ireland, taken up jobs and bought cars, houses, etc. This has led to a huge infrastructural problem in the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The Government is doing a good job given that it has had to cope with a sudden change in the economy. I appreciate that I am a Government backbencher, but any Government would have had similar problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will find out in the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way to address many of these problems, including proper planning, is to develop other parts of the country. There must be economic development in the west and Border regions; the pressure on Dublin must be relieved. Transport and housing problems have been created because everybody is moving to Dublin.</P>
      <P>If we do not want an unattractive urban sprawl from Dundalk to Arklow and across the midlands to Westmeath in 20 years' time, serious decisions must be taken to develop other regions. The Government is undertaking vital strategic planning. In response to the housing problem, it published the Bacon report and the Bacon No. 2 report. The first report had a positive effect on the price of houses and other issues, although many people felt it did not affect the market. A weakness of the report, which I highlighted at the time, was in the private rented sector, on which it had a negative effect. I am glad initiatives were taken in this area in the second report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's response to the second report was that the overall policy framework incorporated three key objectives &ndash; to secure sustained house price stabilisation as quickly as possible through accelerated housing supply; to target key issues, notably housing, affordability and the role of the private rented sector; and to provide an effective strategy in the medium and long-term. Further initiatives being taken to achieve this include arrangements to facilitate the early release of up to 16,000 housing sites in the Dublin north fringe through the provision of temporary sewerage facilities using state of the art technology and the potential of public-private partnerships to develop the north fringe interceptor sewer at a cost of £16 million is being exam<Col N="247" /> ined. Steps are being taken to ensure the serviced land initiative delivers maximum results on schedule.</P>
    <P>Additional investment will be provided to remove significant infrastructural constraints to housing developments, while increased densities are essential to maximise supply. Planning guidelines for local authorities were recently published and they were asked to implement them in draft form. Local authorities will be obliged under law to have regard to these guidelines when they are formally issued. A better mixed use of houses in new developments will be promoted, including more affordable house types with increased density and high quality design.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming reform of planning legislation is under consideration to see how it can be used to reinforce the powers of local authorities to achieve these objectives. Measures to increase access to mortgage funding without increasing supply of housing will not be pursued at this stage as they would only fuel demand and house prices. Other measures to be taken include increased staffing to enable An Bord Pleanála reduce backlogs and delays in determining appeals, examination of the potential for housing of lands in State ownership that are surplus to requirement and to speed up the sale of land for development, and the requirement that planning permission must have been granted to qualify for the lower 20 per cent capital gains tax on the sale of land for residential development has been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have tended to examine only private and local authority housing. I am delighted the Minister of State has taken an interest in the voluntary housing sector because it has huge potential. In Ringsend, my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinn, and I have worked with the local voluntary housing organisation, which has built more than 50 affordable houses for married couples in the area, the most expensive of which cost £50,000. It has been a huge success and the Department of the Environment and Local Government is considering how it can help the organisation in future. The voluntary sector is used to great effect in other countries and it could be used to greater effect here but, unfortunately, local authorities, for whatever reason, seem reluctant to help this sector. That will change and the Minister of State said he was putting pressure on them to examine every area to maximise the number of houses.</P>
    <P>Residential density must also be examined but we must be smart about it because it does not necessarily entail the construction of high rise buildings. Density must be increased, otherwise there will be terrible urban sprawl and the new guidelines published by the Minister of State must be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately it has been interrupted. The Government is meeting the important challenges and problems facing the city of Dublin. The Minister and his colleagues have put in place a number of important initiatives, under the headings of housing and transport, which if implemented would go a long way towards solving the problems and the bottlenecks. I emphasise there must be more development in other parts of the country if Dublin is not to expand into County Westmeath. Many of the Government's initiatives are welcome. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>

      <P>It would have been wrong for the Dáil to go into recess without the opportunity to debate the housing crisis. As the party which requested the debate to review current Government policy, Fine Gael believes there is a direct link between housing policy and the provision of better public transport. The twin issues of housing and public transport represent the new bottlenecks in the economy and cannot be dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>The recent success of the economy could unravel unless the supply of housing is increased to meet demand. The recent ESRI report clearly highlighted the problem when it predicted that Ireland would experience substantial net inward migration over the coming 12 years. It is likely that the population will increase to over 4 million persons by 2012. It has been estimated that in the next ten years housing output will have to be increased by over 40 per cent to deal with the growing demand for housing. Added to the phenomenon of substantial inward migration is the number of persons reaching the age of household formation. The demand for additional housing units will continue to grow over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the difficult challenges ahead in providing for that additional population growth. It could be argued that the political problems of a successful economy are as daunting as those that can emerge with an economy in recession. What most people find impossible to understand is the length of time it has taken the Government to wake up to the scale of the housing crisis. In just over three months, the Government will have been in office two years and there is still no sense of an overall plan or national strategy to tackle the housing crisis.</P>
      <P>Where the Government has attempted to intervene, e.g. the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1988, the implications for the private rented sector have been disastrous. There is no hiding the fact that since coming to office, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have relied on consultants' reports in an attempt to develop a national housing policy.</P>
      <P>People who are priced out of the housing market are demanding action. Fine Gael believes it is a scandal that modern Ireland cannot provide affordable and decent accommodation for its people. A country which prides itself on high levels of home ownership has become one of the most expensive places in Europe to buy or rent a home. Who would have thought it possible that the joint incomes of a garda and a nurse would be unable to meet the cost of purchasing a starter home? Those in the public sector are justifiably enraged as they face an insecure future in the private rented sector. One of the most basic aspirations of society, the aspiration to purchase a home, is virtually unattainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers were told to tighten their belts so that the economy could grow and prosper. It is a sickening irony that the people who created the Celtic tiger can no longer afford to purchase <Col N="251" /> homes in it. Ordinary working people kept their part of the bargain, it is time the Government did the same.</P>
    <P>The Government is particularly defensive about its policies in relation to the housing crisis. Regularly, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and others seek to blame the previous Government for failing to take initiatives in this area. Under the stewardship of this Government, the problems in the housing market have increased substantially. It is no surprise that during the past two years house prices have increased nationally by well over 35 per cent. Despite last year's action, rents continue to soar. There is a massive increase in the number of persons requiring social housing. It is high time the Government took responsibility for this area of policy and stopped blaming its predecessors for the crisis.</P>
    <P>Many of the initiatives announced in the past month or so should have been implemented at a much earlier stage. We now receive from the Department of the Environment and Local Government a weekly housing initiative at a time when the statutory national housing assessment is taking place. The Government is fully aware of the extent of the housing crisis given the massive increase, estimated at 60 per cent, in the number of persons who require local authority housing. The scale of the housing emergency will be announced in the coming weeks by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Government will attempt to deflect criticism by pointing to the recent policy initiatives.</P>
    <P>In the past month a new affordable housing scheme has been announced, density guidelines and the second Bacon report have been published and we have had the recent strategic guidelines for the Dublin region. These long overdue announcements will make some difference but will not dramatically affect the position of the first time buyer.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to date is akin to a motorist coming on the scene of an accident and deciding to call 999 six months after the event. During the first week of March, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, announced the details of a new affordable housing scheme. The scheme is built around the concept that local authorities are to provide additional new homes for low income purchasers on land provided by the relevant authority. As highlighted in a recent Dublin Corporation report there is a complete absence of land in the Dublin region for the provision of social housing. To put it bluntly, the local authority land bank is a thing of the past. While the scheme will affect a small group of people, it is an attempt to ringfence the provision of affordable housing for people who would otherwise remain in the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties concerning the availability of the land bank we have now reached the stage when additional responsibility should be placed on developers to provide a certain percentage of all new homes at fixed rates for middle <Col N="252" /> to low income people. The recent density guidelines will provide a great opportunity for landowners and developers to make double profits literally overnight. Increasing housing units will provide an opportunity for the building industry to make a killing on the sale of new homes.</P>
    <P>The time has long since passed when the Government should compel developers to provide affordable housing at a level of at least 15 to 20 per cent in all new housing schemes. The new density proposals will allow vastly increased housing units to come on to the market in specific areas. The designation of a percentage of all new development for affordable housing has considerable advantages over the Minister's tame scheme involving local authorities. Builders construct housing units at a faster and more efficient rate than local authorities. Through establishing a fixed percentage for affordable housing pressure would be taken away from the diminishing local authority land bank. If it was correct to establish a fixed percentage for affordable housing in the docklands area it must be equally correct to establish such a principle at a time when the new density proposals are put in place.</P>
    <P>There is a political imperative on the building industry to play its part in establishing affordable housing options. The proposal to establish a fixed percentage for affordable housing has been put to great effect in Britain since the passage of the Town and Country Act, 1990. In the British example, I understand that approximately 20 per cent of all new developments in certain areas are designated for affordable housing.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a recent statement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. It has been reported that the Minister in the context of preparing new planning legislation will consider an amendment to the planning laws to limit the zoning of land for residential or industrial use to the five year lifespan of a local authority development plan. The purpose of the proposal is presumably to ensure that land which is rezoned for housing purposes comes on the market as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are countless examples in the Dublin area of large tracts of land zoned for housing, with services on site, to which no planning permission is attached. There are examples of developers sitting on land to ensure that they obtain a higher price for their developments in 12 or 24 months. This land speculation has been helped to a considerable degree by the Government's decision to slash capital gains tax. I could understand an argument to reduce CGT for a 12 month period to help boost the supply of land in specific areas. However, the reduction from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for a three year period has helped developers to sit on land for much longer than is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government may point to an increasing yield from the reduction in CGT. However, there is evidence in the Dublin area in particular that the supply of building land for housing has not <Col N="253" /> come on stream in sufficient quantities. In this context, I welcome the Minister's comments about limiting the zoning of land for the term of a development plan. In addition, specific penalties should be in place at the end of that development plan where land has not been developed or planning permission has not been sought.</P>
    <P>The need to increase densities to increase housing supply has been identified. The Minister should establish a separate unit in his Department to monitor and ensure enforcement of these new guidelines. Individual decisions of planning departments in areas where there is a substantial demand must be scrutinised on a more systematic basis from the viewpoint of the Department of the Environment and Local Government or regional authorities. There are still too many examples of low density developments in areas where there is a demand for housing units. Individual planning departments in the local government system need to know that their actions are being monitored because their decisions have such a dramatic effect on the ability of the State to increase overall housing output.</P>
    <P>While increasing housing densities in certain areas should help to increase supply, the existence of a more efficient and effective planning system would also greatly help in reducing the current log jams in the housing market. I will deal later with the strategic planning guidelines for the Dublin area which were announced last week.</P>
    <P>Regarding planning delays, in the last five years the number of appeals presented to An Bord Pleanála has almost doubled. In 1994, some 2,500 appeals were lodged and this figure increased to 4,500 in 1998. Despite the legislation introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, last year, a considerable backlog of applications is currently under consideration by An Bord Pleanála. I understand the increasing volume of planning appeals to An Bord Pleanála has led to a situation where only 60 per cent of all planning appeals are processed within the four month period, a target set out in the 1992 legislation. The position has changed dramatically since 1995 when more than 95 per cent of appeals were processed within the four month timeframe. Similar difficulties are being experienced at local authority planning department level. The mushrooming in applications to these departments has led to increasing delays in sanctioning various applications.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the Government's response to the second Bacon report, which was issued on 9 March. Despite the discussion last year about the potential for advancing the public/private partnership principle for major infrastructural developments, very little work has been done on the issue and it remains largely aspirational. I understand a difficulty has emerged in the Department of the Environment and Local Government concerning deadlines for the commencement and completion of the serviced land initiative scheme. This is another example of local authorities fall<Col N="254" /> ing down in their responsibilities. To ensure the success of the scheme, it is vital that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is seen to take action against authorities which are not making an effort to respond to the initiative.</P>
    <P>It is also worth questioning how realistic the figure of 16,000 housing units is in relation to the north Dublin fringe. This figure is largely aspirational. I ask the Department of the Environment and Local Government to state who will pay for the temporary sewerage facilities to service the additional development of 16,000 new homes in the Fingal and Dublin Corporation areas. It is arguable whether any private body will invest in a temporary facility which will become redundant following the establishment of the north Dublin interceptor in 2004. I also ask the Department to outline the timeframe for the establishment of the 16,000 homes. I assumed it would be impossible to develop these lands by going through the usual planning and consultation process in less than four years. How serious is the Government about establishing 16,000 new homes in this area of north Dublin?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has consistently held the view that the recommendations of the Buchanan report, which is now 30 years old, have the potential to provide a solution to the problem of population growth. I am interested to know when a national spatial development strategy group will be established by the Government in line with Dr. Bacon's recommendations. I note the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the latest announcement offers no help to the position of tenants in the private rented sector. The Government has dodged the recommendation to increase tax allowances for tenants. Against a background of rocketing rents and insecurity of tenancy, the failure to help this hard pressed group in the housing market is most unfair. It is worth pointing out that the cost of Dr. Bacon's proposal to increase the maximum tax relief for tenants from £500 to £1,000 per annum would be approximately £17.5 million in a full year. If a large group of people are to be encouraged to view the private rented sector as a longer term housing option, it follows that this sector must hold incentives for tenants and landlords. The promotion of long-term leases with specific tax incentives for landlords would greatly help to advance the principle of the private rented sector as a long-term housing option for many people.</P>
    <P>I welcome in principle the decision by the Government to establish a commission to examine the issues relating to security of tenure in the private rented sector. I would have preferred the proposed commission to have a broader remit. It is worth nothing that this decision has been taken in principle and I ask the Government to establish the membership of such a commission and its terms of reference as a matter of priority. There are lessons to be learned from the recent report <Col N="255" /> to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which investigated the circumstances surrounding the Mespil Road flats incident some years ago. There is an urgent need to address the issue of security of tenure and to improve standards in this growing sector of the housing market.</P>
    <P>It should not have taken two years for the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to move on the housing commission. It should not have taken a consultant's report before the Minister of State agreed in principle to establish such a commission. This is yet another example of the Minister of State's foot dragging on the issue.</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to state that the new strategic guidelines issued last year represent the most radical U-turn in development policy for the greater Dublin area in the past 30 years. If the strategic plan and guidelines are to work, Exchequer investment of approximately £3 billion is required. Such an investment requires a completely separate stream of funding from the national development plan which is being considered in the context of the next round of Structural Funds. Plans can only be put into effect where hard cash is available to back up the projects which need to be put in place in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State comment on how the new strategic guidelines can be enforced when six of the seven county development plans in the greater Dublin area are already in place? Will the Minister of State direct local authorities to materially contravene their plans? Can any of the guidelines be put into operation before the new planning legislation is enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas? I understand the legislation is promised for 1999 and it will take some time for the Bill to go through both Houses given its comprehensive nature.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government has not addressed the housing crisis. It stands indicted for its inaction in all areas of the housing market, particularly in relation to the huge increase in the number of applications for social housing. That is the largest scandal in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, particularly in the context of the recent publication of the strategic planning guidelines which I believe will be the framework for the most rapid change we have ever seen or will see in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>These population and employment changes will happen whether or not we are ready for them. The Dublin local authorities which initiated this process, although the Government has since hijacked it, are to be congratulated. They recognised the need for a framework to accommodate all future changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Bacon reports and the guidelines have given us some inkling of the scale of the challenge which lies ahead in terms of the provision of housing. We now know that meeting the housing needs of the greater Dublin area will require the <Col N="256" /> provision of a 50 per cent increase in housing by 2011. By any standards this is a phenomenal challenge, comparable only to that faced in European cities following the war.</P>
    <P>Even if we meet the challenge, it does not mean we will solve the housing crisis, which is fundamentally a question of affordability. As my colleague Deputy Hayes said, they are related but distinct problems.</P>
    <P>Housing is only one aspect of people's needs, albeit an important one. A settlement strategy must provide for all the needs of the community. If we are to build sustainable and stable communities which afford people a reasonable quality of life, we must also facilitate the provision of their economic, social, recreational, cultural, educational, health and transport needs. When we adopt and implement a settlement strategy we are making long-term decisions about the quality of life for a generation of people. It cannot simply be a question of providing water, drainage and acres of housing then walking away from all the other needs which make the difference between housing people and giving them the opportunity for civilised living.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in launching the strategic planning guidelines, said he would formally request that the local authorities abide by them. As far as the local authorities in Dublin are concerned, he need have no fear. They recognised the emerging crisis long before any Government and before it became a trendy media hyped issue. They embraced agenda 21 and adopted the principles of sustainable development when there was precious little support for these concepts from the Government, media or the public. They will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can only do so much. Through their development plans they can facilitate and encourage high density development, they can provide mixed use zoning to reduce the overall demand for travel and they can direct development to consolidate the metropolitan area and the designated growth centres in the hinterland but they cannot provide a single bus, child care place, health centre or school. The Government cannot simply issue directives to the local authorities and then wash its hands of the problem.</P>
    <P>The success of this strategy lies with the Government and its willingness to commit resources to the greater Dublin area. Will the same directive be issued to CIE to provide the transport services required by this vastly increased population? I ask that question with a degree of scepticism because I lived in a new suburb 30 years ago and 30 years on thousands of my neighbours and I are still waiting for a bus service.</P>
    <P>The report clearly stated that the success of the strategy hinges on the mass provision of transport. It does not matter if it is provided by the public or private sector. Much as we decry traffic congestion today, in ten years time we will look back on this as a golden age such will be the nightmarish conditions which will pertain unless <Col N="257" /> we take the traffic issue by the scruff of the neck and deal with it with the required urgency.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to solving the problem of traffic in Dublin. There has been announcement after announcement by the Government but we are not winning the battle; we are not even holding our own. Every day things get worse &ndash; businesses lose money, competitiveness diminishes, tempers are frayed, pollution increases and still car ownership and usage is increasing. That is the reality of life for urban dwellers in Dublin and its hinterland. It will get worse. We know that by 2011 there will be an additional 250,000 people trying to get to work every morning. That is an average of 20,000 extra people each year. The Government response in terms of peak hour rail provision, which will come on stream in the next few years, will cater for 11,000 people. If we are to have any hope of averting disaster, the Government must make a massive public investment in commuter services and bring in the private sector at every level to provide the competition, capacity, funding and sense of urgency needed to get the job done.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the 150 extra buses. They will provide one bus per route. Six years was spent designing Luas and not one shovel has been put in the ground. This rate of progress is disastrous. We know what is needed because population forecasts are reasonably accurate.</P>
    <P>My fear is that, with regionalisation and the drop in EU funding for the eastern region, the Government will find it all too easy to turn its back on the greater Dublin area. We will see the increased population and housing but precious little else of what is needed to make life tolerable for citizens in urban areas. Any Government which considers doing that would be well advised to remember that it is turning its back on 1.6 million people, the projected population for 2011, who will produce 50 per cent of national output. If those people cannot have civilised living conditions, cannot get to work, do business and move goods, then Dublin, which is already scarcely viable, will fail as an economic unit and as a place in which to live. If we jeopardise the population of Dublin and their 50 per cent of output, we jeopardise the entire State. The economic miracle and all its potential will tumble down around us.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot leave the implementation of these guidelines to the local authorities. It must introduce other measures. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for the development of the strategy and he must ensure measures are developed to deal with traffic congestion. He could immediately introduce a measure enabling local authorities to levy a public transport contribution when granting planning permission. At the moment local authorities are in receipt of an enormous number of planning applications for housing and commercial and industrial developments. The authorities have no legal standing to request a levy and opportunities to secure funding for public transport are being lost. Tra<Col N="258" /> ditionally the authorities have the ability to provide contributions for water, drainage and roads services. As many of the applications are for infill development, sometimes road contributions are not appropriate. A public transport contribution would be far more appropriate. This may be considered in the context of the new planning legislation, but it is urgently required. We cannot afford to wait another six months for this. Opportunities are being lost every day as planning permissions are being granted. I would be grateful if the Minister would consider introducing that legislation as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The heated exchange that took place between Deputy Eoin Ryan and my colleagues highlighted why we have a housing crisis in Dublin, why the land prices are so high and house prices are beyond the reach of the average individual. The reason was the complete absence of rational debate. If it had taken place, as it did in the past, it would have allowed for the provision of a reasonable amount of zoned land. In the battle that took place between those who wanted to zone everything and those who wanted to zone nothing all reason went out of the argument. On the one hand there were those who thought the other side was dishonest and that side thought its opponents were irresponsible. The outcome was a climate in which every decision was suspect and open to accusation and because there was so much at risk and land prices were escalating at such a rate the situation was open to abuse. I hope that one of the benefits of these new guidelines is that this will never occur again in Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As our economy grows, every year the huge infrastructural deficit facing our country becomes more apparent. Nowhere is this more apparent than in housing and transport. The infrastructural deficits in both those area are linked. The recent national investment priorities report by ESRI for 2000-6 reveals that a figure of more than £50 billion would be needed in these and other areas in the coming five year period. The difficulties were made much greater by the recent performance of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in Brussels. They came back with £3 billion net for the six year period, but each year over the next six years our contribution to Europe, which according to the Department of Finance now stands at £800 million at year, will far surpass the money that will flow in Structural and Cohesion Funds. That leaves us in a very invidious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State trumpeted the fact that he has reached the target of 4,500 new local authority houses, but that only barely meets 10 per cent of the massive demand for houses. This is brought to the attention of Members on a weekly <Col N="259" /> basis at their advice clinics. The length of the housing waiting list in Dublin and in other urban and rural areas throughout the country is appalling.</P>
    <P>During this debate we heard about the causes of the current housing crisis. They include the growth of households, Irish people returning from abroad and net immigration. Another contributory factor is the downright greed of developers, builders and the auctioneering profession. I noticed that when a company, which announced recently it is to be floated on the Stock Exchange, arrived on the north side housing prices jumped in value by approximately 30 per cent. Some of those professions, to use the words of our great poet, William Butler Yeats, have &ldquo;sucked the marrow from the bone&rdquo;. They extracted every last penny from young couples and households. There is a question mark over the auctioneering profession in terms of the qualification required, its administration and supervision. Perhaps the Minister of State should address this area during his term of office.</P>
    <P>As my colleagues on my left said, the Minister of State has failed abysmally to tackle this crisis during the past two years. He hid behind his Fianna Fáil adviser, Peter Bacon, and pushed his ideas to the forefront to hide the fact that he had no ideas on how to tackle this crisis. He was asked by all the voluntary agencies to set up a commission on housing to examine the problems in depth and to come up with a sustainable plan for the next 10 or 15 years, but he refused to do that. The Labour Party set up a national commission on housing overseen by Deputy Gilmore. He cannot be here today and I am taking his place. We visited most of the major cities and towns, gathered evidence and noted the ideas put forward by all the voluntary housing groups and by people on housing and transfer lists. We hope to put those ideas before the people at the forthcoming local elections and the next general election and to bring them to Government, if we are elected to office.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of the initiatives taken in relation to the first and second Bacon reports. There were questions marks over housing densities. Some of our journalistic colleagues in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> pointed out the rural splendour in which people like Peter Bacon and others live, while young people have been asked to live in a density of 20 houses to the acre. In the past Ballymun was the main area of high density housing. There is also high density housing in Darndale and Belcamp in my constituency. The provision of such high density local authority housing is an abysmal failure. The issue of density in relation to prices is also questionable. In parts of my constituency, along the Howth peninsula, there are high density town houses, but prices there have gone through the roof. Houses are selling for £200,000 plus. We need a much more vigorous response on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> I welcome what the Minister of State said about the voluntary sector and the housing mix. I salute the county manager of Fingal, Mr. Willie Soffe, who indicated he would like at least a 20 per cent social housing mix in major residential developments on the northern fringe of the city and in south Fingal.</P>
    <P>A deep concern of the Labour Party is the escalation of rents and the way that has impinged on young people and on those on the housing waiting list. In my constituency tenants have to pay between £500 to £800 per month in rent for a modest three bedroomed house. A examination of the introduction of mandatory price controls in the rental sector must be undertaken. Tenants are struggling to pay their rents.</P>
    <P>The public sector is also involved in this area through the payment of rent supplements. The rent supplement budget has escalated. In the previous Government my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, attempted to bring together the rent supplement area and local authority housing provision, but since he left office this has not moved forward.</P>
    <P>The housing shortage to some extent was artificially created by the political boundaries. Why is there not a single housing list for the four counties? That would benefit the Government because some people are on two housing lists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eoin Ryan referred to the recent rezoning of Pelletstown. The city council, made up mainly of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties, rezoned the land as agricultural land, Z10. Following consultation it was rezoned, through the manager's intervention, as Z16, a master housing plan. That infuriated the Labour Party at a recent council meeting in the Mansion House. Councillors had a choice to vote for the land to be zoned as Z10 or Z16, but we decided to abandon the charade and walk out.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of the State an initiative of my constituents in the Baldoyle area. It is proposed to create two new urban parishes of possibly 2,500 to 3,000 houses. Through their consultants, whom they paid approximately £4,000 or £5,000, Baldoyle Community Association presented this excellent plan. They took it upon themselves to put forward this plan during the debate on the final stage of the Fingal Development Plan. They would like a significant portion of the racecourse, which are wetlands, a natural habitat and amenity lands, retained for the community of Baldoyle in conjunction with appropriate residential development and an appropriate mix of development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the strategic planning guidelines. At long last we are beginning to examine the real issues. However, I wish to comment on the provisions relating to water and sewerage schemes. The rainbow Government came up with almost £42 million, a small sum, but at least something towards a strategic water plan for Dublin. The managers of the four Dublin councils have stated that we need to spend a minimum of £200 million to £300 million to secure Dublin's water supply. <Col N="261" /> Last weekend basic maintenance was carried out at the Leixlip works. Because Dublin has no strategic standby water supply, we had to turn off the supply for the entire north of the county for two days. This is incredible nonsense. Cities such as Paris have water on standby in case of emergencies such as a terrorist attack. However, Dublin has no such reserves. Its water supply is on a knife edge and the Minister is doing nothing about it. There is no point in setting out guidelines unless the Government is prepared to put its money where its mouth is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan spoke about transport and the need to look at the greater Dublin region. However, Dublin representatives have always recognised the lack of investment as the fundamental problem. Deputy Olivia Mitchell was correct on this issue.</P>
    <P>We went into the local elections in 1991 expecting to see Luas built in four or five years. Nine years later we are nowhere near that point. The same applies to the Dublin port tunnel, the eastern by-pass and moneys for Dublin Bus. The new buses became available only recently. The Government is hypocritical to speak about serious planning and the £430 million for CIE's safety programme. Deputy O'Rourke is not prepared to provide one penny towards that programme and is forcing CIE to sell off property. We do not know from where the £400 million for Luas will come.</P>
    <P>The Government is not offering any answers to these questions. It is doing very badly on housing and transport and will get an unpleasant answer from the electorate in Dublin in ten weeks. I welcome its measures on planning guidelines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. Every public representative is aware of the housing crisis. Even the Minister acknowledges that a housing crisis has gripped the country in recent years. The word crisis is appropriate as every sector of the housing market is in chaos.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is increasing at a frightening rate in every town and city. We are all aware of instances where extended families are living in the one house, leading to gross overcrowding. People are sleeping in sitting rooms as they cannot get local authority houses.</P>
      <P>People are also living in mobile homes where one can see condensation running down walls or dripping from ceilings on to beds where couples sleep with two or three children. At the same time we talk about equality and health care. The conditions I have described are consequences of the housing shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenants in the private rented sector are labouring under spiralling rents, lack of regulation and fear of eviction. Those on local authority housing lists are gripped by a sense of hopelessness that their housing needs will ever be catered for and the waiting lists grow and grow. About 45,000 people are on housing lists. Young couples see their dreams of owning a home vanish as prices <Col N="262" /> rocket out of control. This is taking place in a week when newspapers trumpeted the news of Ireland's first millionaires' row in my constituency. Is it any wonder that ordinary people ask what sort of Government we have? There is a two tier system and we are looking after those who have political clout. Is it any wonder that people look in awe at developments at the tribunals?</P>
    <P>I take issue with Deputies Mitchell and Ryan when they suggest that the Labour Party is somehow responsible for the scandal of rezoning. The Labour Party is in favour of proper planning and development. This has always been our position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell correctly referred to the lack of public transport. How can we provide adequate public transport and road networks when we have the <i>ad hoc</i> rezoning of lands where it will take ten or 15 years before there is proper infrastructure or transport? In many cases the only reason land in the middle of nowhere was rezoned was because of the undue influence of builders. That is why we have a tribunal of inquiry. We should not forget this when people point the finger at the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s elected members of Dublin County Council could not get into the chamber because it was full of developers and their agents trying to secure recommendations for rezoning land. These recommendations had been drawn up by those developers and builders. Some of the recommendations were legitimate and presented no difficulty. However, others took no cognisance of other development needs and the requirement for infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Department's figures show that house prices rose by between 24 per cent and 29 per cent in 1998. This at a time when ordinary people are trying to buy a home. For months the Minister would not accept that there was a crisis. There has been a flurry of apparent Government activity on housing. Why? Does it have something to do with the local and European elections in June?</P>
    <P>A new affordable housing scheme was announced on 2 March. I contacted local authorities to see what information they had on this new scheme. All we got was a press release from the Department and a three page document. This was to solve the problem. According to the Minister of State, under the terms of the new affordable houses scheme, local authorities would provide additional new houses on land available to them in or near centres where house prices have created an affordability gap. What land is available in the greater Dublin area? There is little or nothing. Some land is available in Fingal and I am pleased that Mr. William Soffe, the manager, and Alan Carthy, the principal officer, are endeavouring to provide it for housing. However, when a Minister claims that 400 houses will be provided by the end of the year as a consequence of this initiative, it is just a PR exercise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> I wish to mention the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wright is in the Chamber and is aware of the limits on the shared ownership scheme in the Fingal area. The maximum loan is £90,000. The repayments, which consist of the mortgage repayment and the rent element, are £116 per week. The Housing Finance Agency scheme provides finance at a fixed interest rate of 4.4 per cent. That will still mean that people will have to pay more than £100 per week. I do not expect it to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ryan's comments on the availability of land. Land is a critical element in meeting housing need. It is particularly important for local authorities to acquire land to ensure housing needs are met.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate on the planning process. We are living in a time of flux, with unprecedented circumstances exerting pressures on the system. These circumstances include population growth, demographic change, prosperity and increased centralisation in the greater Dublin region. Enormous profits are being made by land developers and owners and great distress is experienced by those who cannot access housing.</P>
      <P>The need for proper planning has never been greater, yet the flaws in the planning process have never been more evident or disturbing. That a tribunal is investigating corruption, political and administrative, in the planning system speaks for itself. That investigation is vital for the public good. As the demands on housing and transport become more acute, we have a responsibility to ensure there is a robust, effective, accountable and clean planning system that can meet changing needs in harmony with the environment and not in conflict with it.</P>
      <P>At present, we do not have such a planning system. We could have it. Great progress has been made since the Planning Act, 1963 but local authorities dealing with complex issues often do not even have basic planning expertise. The public they serve is more educated and informed about planning matters and has higher expectations that its views will be heard. That so many planning issues end up in the courts is a symptom of a failure in the system which must be addressed. That so many people are disenchanted with and suspicious of the planning process requires an initiative from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to address those concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the public buys into the planning process, the process will not work. I will cite one example of system failure with which I am familiar. I live in Bray, a town which has experienced extraordinary population growth in the past 30 years. It is known for its natural setting, with a seafront that is bound on the southern end by Bray Head. Bray Head is a place of pilgrimage <Col N="264" /> and is a favourite site for picnics. It was selected recently by Wicklow County Council as the county project under the EU funded SRUNA programme to develop a recreational strategy for the head. This strategy was to be based on sustainability principles.</P>
    <P>It is an area designated by both Bray UDC and Wicklow County Council for a special amenity area order. Bray Head is special but vulnerable. The demand for building land in Bray is extreme because of the natural limits set by the landscape and the desire of many people to live there. Two schools, for example, one primary and one second level, are suffering the consequences of being starved of land for school building purposes.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, McInerney Brothers, developers, applied to Bray UDC to build 70 housing units on the lower slopes of Bray Head. The land in question is reserved for education/community use with housing only, and clearly, specified as secondary. Since Bray UDC had no qualified planner, it availed of the services of the Wicklow County Council senior planner who recommended refusal on the grounds of amenity and educational need.</P>
    <P>Despite this advice, permission was granted by the local authority. That decision provoked a wave of fury in the town which resulted in 10,000 local people signing an objection to An Bord Pleanála. It also, unusually, galvanised all members of Bray UDC to lodge objections in their own names. I do not think such a thing has occurred anywhere else in the country. All councillors agreed to object to the decision. They made the point that the proposed development was detrimental to the amenity and integrity of Bray Head and that there was an educational imperative.</P>
    <P>An oral hearing was held. Local residents and SOHO, the Save Our Head Organisation, organised to put forward their case. Local people invested time, commitment, energy and money to participate in the oral hearing. They participated because they believed in the system and that the system would act fairly. If anybody who participated in the oral hearing were asked now if they still believed that the principles of fairness, accountability and sustainability applied in the planning process, their response would be in the negative.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála granted permission. The decision went against the development plan, the wishes of the local people and local representatives and the best planning advice. There was deep disappointment in the town. A week later when the inspector's report was published, that disappointment turned to unalloyed anger. It is worth remembering that the inspector who was commissioned by An Bord Pleanála is the most expert person in the process. The inspector visits the site, reads the documentation, presides over the oral hearing and knows more than anybody about a planning controversy.</P>
    <P>In this instance the inspector did a good job. His report was 97 pages long and its conclusions were unequivocal. The thrust of the report leads <Col N="265" /> one unambiguous way &ndash; the inspector recommended that permission not be granted. The two principal grounds were clearly stated: there would be grievous injury to Bray Head if it was granted and there was a land use imperative for educational use. Inexplicably, the board ignored that advice, overruled the inspector's report and granted permission without explanation or justification.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that An Bord Pleanála can have such power. An Bord Pleanála is now responsible for doing serious injury to Bray Head and for materially contravening the Bray development plan, in the process denying children access to decent accommodation. I have no doubt it is also in contravention of the new strategic planning guidelines, although I have not yet had a chance to check that. The board has no obligation to explain or justify its decision. There is no democratic accountability. It provided only one line stating its decision. The board is a law unto itself.</P>
    <P>The nature of the board is that it has complete authority and no accountability. This is a form of autocracy that would not be acceptable in other circumstances. The Minister is aware that a State board would not be able to get away with this. The Minister would have to come to the House to explain a decision which ran contrary to expert advice. Even a semi-State board would have difficulty getting away with such blindness to the need for accountability.</P>
    <P>The establishment of An Bord Pleanála was understandable at the time. It was intended to deal with misuse of ministerial power. However, it is not only politicians who can be corrupt. Anybody can be corrupt if they have sufficient power and if they are not accountable. I am not saying that anybody in An Bord Pleanála is corrupt but the breeding ground for corruption is there because of the democratic deficit that exists. This is an important point that needs to be reiterated at a time when we are experiencing major pressure in planning terms and when there is a major drive towards expanded development, maximising our housing potential, etc.</P>
    <P>People have to trust the system and people must not be put in positions of authority where they are open in any way to the possibility of corruption. In this instance it is important for the public good that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government takes on this task, addresses the deficit that exists and deals with an issue that is at the core of proper planning and development. I cannot believe we have an appeals board that can simply do what it is told by its inspectorate and do serious harm to a natural landscape.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to address what is a simple measure in legislative terms to ensure An Bord Pleanála comes under the umbrella of accountability. If that modest but vital step is taken, the Minister will have the wholehearted support of the Labour Party in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in what Deputy McManus had to say. I assumed An Bord Pleanála had a semi-judicial role when it was set up. When the Office of the Telecommunications Regulation was set up, which occurred the week before I came into office, the regulator, Etain Doyle, was not answerable to anybody. When she was asked to come before the public enterprise committee her legal advice was that she did not have to appear. We are rectifying that omission in the Bill. She subsequently appeared before the committee on several occasions and gave a full account of her work. She will be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The general principle is the same &ndash; accountability. People put slips of paper into the ballot boxes and tell us what they think of us but the idea that because a person is not a politician he or she is not answerable to anybody for far-reaching decisions is wrong. There has to be accountability to the only democratic process which is this House. It makes for an interesting and necessary debate.</P>
      <P>We are at the beginning of a new era for public transport in Ireland. We have to make substantial investment in public transport for a number of reasons. There is the pace and scale of economic growth which is leading to congestion; such growth has led to a huge increase in car ownership in recent years; population growth is forecast, particularly an increase in the number of households; we are also facing a number of environmental challenges with our Kyoto obligations to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions; and increased house prices are leading to an exodus of people from major urban areas to surrounding towns where the cost of housing is cheaper.</P>
      <P>What objectives should we seek to achieve when developing the public transport system? Clearly it needs to have the physical capacity to cater for passenger demands. It must have frequency and reliability. It must give good value for money, it needs to be safe and, above all, it must be customer focused.</P>
      <P>What can we do to make this renaissance of public transport a practical reality? Since 1994, a major rail renewal programme has been on the way. This has been helped by the reallocation of the Luas EU funding last summer. Under that programme, the track network from Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Carrick-on-Shannon and Kilkenny and from Mallow to Killarney has been or is being renewed, and signalling on the Galway, Sligo, Tralee and Waterford lines is being upgraded. Substantial progress is also being made on the Dublin suburban rail network, with the extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide and the upgrading of the Maynooth service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway safety programme has been agreed by Cabinet which will involve the maintenance of the existing lines, the renewal of 390 miles of jointed track and risk mitigation measures at 600 level crossings, the renewal of 110 bridges and <Col N="267" /> new signalling installations at Heuston and Limerick. The programme also includes a series of measures designed to improve safety management systems. The retention of all the existing lines is a formal Government decision.</P>
    <P>In response to the Dublin Transportation Office short-term action plan, the Government agreed last summer to extra investment for public transport in Dublin. That will begin next April and there will be implementation also of the quality bus corridors.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Dublin light rail project, the public inquiry for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line begins on 13 April. The light railway order for the Tallaght to Abbey Street line has been signed and we await any request for judicial review. I hesitate to say that in case I encourage it.</P>
    <P>In addition to implementing the largest programme of public transport investment we are also engaged in a substantial planning process for the future. On 4 March I obtained Government approval to arrange for costing and feasibility work on a short and longer-term development programme for the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area and Cork.</P>
    <P>The focus of the short-term programme will be to make more intensive use of the existing rail corridors such as the provision of additional DART and suburban rail rolling stock; the lengthening of station platforms; upgrading of the line between Connolly and Heuston stations; and the development of new stations at suitable locations linked to housing and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The development of the suburban rail system in Cork, including the possible upgrading of services on the Mallow to Cork and Cork to Cobh lines, and the reopening of the Midleton line, depends on plans for residential and other developments in the line catchment.</P>
    <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area include a number of suggestions for improving the suburban rail network in the longer term. While these are only at the conceptual stage and require detailed technical and economic feasibility, they point the way forward for commuter travel.</P>
    <P>A range of proposals is now being considered. A new inland rail link to Navan will be assessed. The possible separation of long distance and commuter rail traffic through the construction of bypass rail lines will be evaluated. One option to be examined is a link from the existing Belfast line through Swords and Dublin Airport to the western lines. The quadrupling of existing double lines will be considered, where feasible. Provision or enhancement of rail services to the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines will be examined. The phase one development centres identified by the guidelines include Drogheda, Naas/Newbridge/Kilcullen, Wicklow and Navan, and the phase two centres include Athy, Arklow, Kildare and Monasterevin. <Col N="268" /> More sophisticated signalling technology to increase track capacity will also be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The DTO is working on an update of the original DTI strategy. The first phase of this work is concentrating on a short-term programme for the period 2000 to 2006 and that will be completed hopefully by the end of April. The second phase is the preparation of a longer-term strategy up to 2016 and the target for the completion of this work is the end of this year.</P>
    <P>An important part of the work being undertaken by the DTO will be to improve the integration of public transport services. The planning, implementation and integration of public transport services is just as important as getting the money. We are getting new buses for the Dublin area, and there are plans for the opening of new commuter stations and stations which had been redundant. The rail safety study is also in place. In the greater Dublin area in particular there will have to be integration of heavy rail, lighter heavy rail, the Luas, the DART, ordinary buses and smaller buses. The planning can be done on paper, but the implementation of an integration plan will be a huge task and much thought will have to go into it because money and fine plans will not mean success unless there is integration. The integration process will also seek to build on the transport nodes concept put forward in the strategic planning guidelines. It will address other integration measures such as integrated fares, ticketing, better interchange facilities and park and ride.</P>
    <P>At my request, CIE carried out a series of investment reviews covering all its main activities &ndash; mainline and suburban rail, rail freight, Dublin bus, provincial bus services and public transport in the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>A number of transportation studies are being undertaken. The local authorities and CIE operating companies in Cork are finalising a new transport plan which will build on the fine work of the original land use and transportation studies. Galway and Limerick are also undertaking such studies. The outcome of all this planning work will be considered as part of a review of strategic transport needs for the country as a whole which will in turn provide an input into the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>I am working on a three-pronged strategy for the development of public transport. One will set out an investment programme for the mainline rail network, building on the recently announced safety programme. Another will focus on the development of public transport in the greater Dublin area and the surrounding counties, taking into account the work on the short-term suburban rail programme and the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Office and the strategic planning guidelines. The third will be a developmental programme for regional public transport which will pay particular attention to cities other than Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> One of the principal challenges which we will face in implementing this very necessary public transport programme will be finding the funding required. The levels of EU Structural and Cohesion funding will decline sharply between now and 2006. CIE has the capacity to generate internal resources for investment through depreciation and is committed to doing so. I am commissioning a review of CIE's property portfolio to identify what cash can be generated through disposal of surplus non-operational or potentially non-operational property and through redevelopment. Public-private partnerships will have some potential for generating risk capital. In the next week or two I expect to receive the Arthur Andersen study which involves my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government looking at projects with potential for public-private partnerships. The main potential for public-private partnerships is likely to be in the area of better value for money over the life cycle of a project to improved efficiency and innovation. Any public transport development programme will require substantial Exchequer support, both in the form of capital investment grants and ongoing revenue support for uneconomic but socially desirable services.</P>
    <P>I will also be working with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to achieve a much greater degree of integration between transport and land use policies. The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area come into play here. When fully implemented, they will reinforce the public transport system in the city and surrounding region as the primary means of travel, especially for commuters. We have to deliver on both the public transport and settlement strategy elements of those guidelines if Dublin is to develop in a sustainable way. The draft residential density guidelines, recently published for comment by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, are also very important in that they will facilitate higher residential densities in public transport corridors. This in turn can improve the viability of the public transport product.</P>
    <P>We will all look back on this year as the beginning of a new era for public transport in Ireland. It will have seen a renewed commitment to the railway and a recognition of the importance of public transport to the creation of sustainable cities, towns and rural areas. We face substantial challenges in the years ahead to achieve the objectives I set out, but we have the intellectual and financial resources and the self-confidence to achieve them if we put our minds to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is timely that we are having this debate now, shortly after agreement on the package of Agenda 2000 by the European Union Heads of State and Government and as we are in the process of drawing up and preparing the National Development Plan for the period 2000 to 2006. The levels of growth we have experi<Col N="270" /> enced here in recent years and the maintenance of our competitive capacity will be substantially influenced for the better if we are able to achieve a more dispersed pattern of growth than we have seen in recent years. By that I mean a more even spread of both economic and social growth across the regions of the country and a more even spread of infrastructural provision.</P>
      <P>In that context the current debate on regionalisation is a very timely one. It is a pity it did not take place in better circumstances. It would have been better if the Government had not made such a mess of the regionalisation proposal. However, we have a regionalisation structure in place, which I hope we will use to achieve the kind of dispersed pattern of growth of which I speak and which will be very important for the maintenance of high overall rates of growth and the maintenance of competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The imbalance between east and west has to be redressed for a number of reasons. The first and most obvious is clearly the need for growth and development in the western part of the country and the need to increase the west's ability to compete and participate in the marketplace. It is needed also to maintain the viability, growth potential and competitiveness of the eastern part of the country which is now in serious danger of losing its competitiveness as a result of congestion and its attraction as a place to live because of that kind of congestion, and which is meeting major bottlenecks in all kinds of areas, both in economic and social infrastructure. For all those reasons, we should look at economic and planning policies with a view to getting a more even spread of growth.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the re-emergence of what I would call the Buchanan type of thinking. We were wrong to ditch that set of proposals for an approach to development in 1969 and we would be wrong to depart from it now. I know that view is not shared by everybody. I am disappointed to hear spokespersons for western development are arguing again, as they did in 1969, against the kind of deliberate selection of growth centres that is implicit in that approach. They should reconsider this matter.</P>
      <P>A pattern we adopted since 1969, which I might call the non-Buchanan approach &ndash; whereby we tried to spread development all over the country and rejected the idea of picking centres for development &ndash; has not given us evenly spread growth. Anyone looking at the economic and social map of Ireland today will see that. It provided growth in a small number of centres than were identified and proposed in the Buchanan strategy.</P>
      <P>Since 1969 we have had substantial growth in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway. It is only in very recent years that the trickle-down effect of that growth has started to affect other centres, such as Kilkenny, Athlone, Tralee, Castlebar and Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contention is that had we adopted a Buchanan-type approach earlier, we would have seen <Col N="271" /> earlier growth in all those centres that are only now beginning to show signs of development. We should reinforce that process by selecting the centres where we will push for facilitating increased growth. That has to do with the way we plan infrastructure provision.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that people who make this kind of case should bell the cat and name their priorities. The centres I propose should now receive special attention for development are Letterkenny, Donegal, Ballina, Castlebar, Ennis, Tralee and probably Bantry. If we can facilitate development in those centres we will be doing something substantial and worthwhile to support the pattern of growth dispersal about which I am talking.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other places in the midlands that need special attention. I will single out only two; Portlaoise and Athy. I am not mentioning Athy because it is in my constituency but because it is in that nexus of towns in the midlands that, to a large extent, have been passed over by growth and that now require further development. Portlaoise has a potential for development that needs to be realised.</P>
    <P>Those towns need to be developed to relieve some of the pressure that will inevitably come to bear on the greater Dublin area if we allow current trends to continue unchecked. I will deal with the rest of County Kildare when I discuss the strategic planning guidelines that have been drawn up and about which a good deal needs to be said.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons for selecting the towns that I have named along the west coast. Possibly the most eloquent case for those towns can be seen in figures 3.8 and 3.9 in the ESRI publication <i>National Investment Priorities</i>. The tables set out travel time to work for selected larger towns and major urban centres. There are substantial areas of the country within 30 minutes travel time of Letterkenny, Donegal, Sligo, Ballina, Castlebar, Ennis, Tralee and Bantry. Even larger parts of the country would be within 30 minutes travel time of those towns if we provided the kind of infrastructural development I am talking about and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Making that possible will attract to those areas the kind of growth we need to counteract the excessive dependence on development we have seen in the eastern part of the country. The same applies to Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Athy.</P>
    <P>We have the potential to avoid the congestion in the greater Dublin area. We also have the potential to create in these other towns I mentioned vibrant attractive places in which to live and work. We can do it if we concentrate in the way that is being suggested, but we will not do it if we try to have a little bit of growth all over the place. That policy has failed us before and will do so again if we try it.</P>
    <P>Planning must be much more integrated than has been the custom up to now. I am not sure the <Col N="272" /> structure of regional authorities we have now will provide us with the tools we require to integrate planning in the way that is needed. Nor am I convinced that planning law as it currently stands will give us that. We need to plan for the provision of economic and social infrastructure together, along with the kind of priorities we have been discussing. We also need to plan some other matters.</P>
    <P>Over most of the country outside Dublin there is no effective road transport available for people who do not have a car. I listened with interest to the Minister's plans for the railways and I wish her well. As far as that plan goes, it is certainly picking up the right points, but even that does not meet the need because not everybody lives within reasonable distance of a railway line. There are huge numbers of people who have virtually no access to public transport, but that need not be the case. Lack of access to public transport in rural areas and smaller towns is due to the fact that we have continued to rely on a State monopoly to provide public transport services. There are some competitors. It could be fairly said a number of such competitors &ndash; I am mixing my metaphors here &ndash; are sailing very close to the wind in the way they provide bus transport. It is nonsensical to continue to apply the current rules for the provision of bus transport services.</P>
    <P>There is an immediate and undeniable case for the liberalisation of bus transport, certainly outside our major urban areas. If that were done, it would vastly increase the opportunities of people to live in rural areas and work in a more concentrated set of urban centres. The two, however, have to go together. If nothing else, it is a serious injustice on huge numbers of people in rural Ireland to deny them access to public transport in that way. That is something I would like to see the Government taking up. It is not dealt with at any length in any of the major planning documents that we have before us, but it is something that should be addressed in the context of the national development programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus spoke about problems with An Bord Pleanála and particular decisions in Bray, but there is another dimension to the integration of planning. I can illustrate it with a case in my own constituency, and many other Members can do the same. Another unaccountable planning decision was made by the county council in relation to an application to build approximately 400 houses in Ballymore Eustace in County Kildare, which is being appealed to An Bord Pleanála. I do not know what the outcome will be, but I hope it is turned down. Planning permission was given while at the same time the principal of the local national school is obliged to run a campaign to try to get facilities in the school for the existing pupils brought near the current norms and accepted standards for class and room size, the provision of a general purpose room, space for equipment, an office for the principal and so on. On one hand there is a proposal for a major increase in the population of the area, <Col N="273" /> while on the other the school is already inadequate for the existing schoolgoing population.</P>
    <P>There is no way we can link decisions to allow further housing development with other decisions that might help us to act according to the needs that may arise. The Department of Education and Science has its own priorities when it comes to schools, and it has nothing to do with the demand for schools and where the population is expanding. We will have to give serious attention to this kind of integration in planning, though it will place substantial demands on us.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the ESRI survey which contains a table of indicative estimates of investment priorities for the period 2000 to 2006 on page 141. In housing, our total 1999 provision for housing, capital and current, was £858 million; the ESRI proposes that we should invest £820 million per annum between now and 2006. Transport investment in 1999 amounted to £646 million, and the ESRI proposes that we invest £880 million per annum, in 1999 terms, for the period 2000 to 2006, which is a major increase. In environmental services it provides an increase from £301 million to £308 million per annum, and in regional development it states that our annual level of investment should go from £131 million this year to £225 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I am not going to argue with the ESRI, but I am surprised that the figures are so low. I would have expected them to be higher. If we look at the overall requirements and where we are to get this funding, we see we have a major problem. In the areas covered by Structural and Cohesion Funds, the ESRI shows that in 1999 we invested £2.7 billion, which includes the funding from the EU. The annual requirement for the same area for 2000 to 2006 at 1999 prices is again £2.72 billion, and that is at a much lower level of EU funding and apart from other infrastructural investments we will have to carry out which do not qualify for EU funding anyway. We are going to have a major requirement for investment funds to sustain this programme.</P>
    <P>Strategic planning guidelines for Dublin and its hinterlands were recently set out, and they are very interesting. It struck me forcefully while reading the guidelines that I could find only one reference to waste management, and that is in appendix 4. It points out that waste management policies will achieve stabilisation of municipal waste quantities and diversion of 20 per cent of municipal waste from landfill by recycling. It does not say how this is to be done. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has never said it is to be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a plan published in 1997 that set out these objectives, but nothing is being done now. Most of Dublin's waste is going to Kill in County Kildare, and nothing is being done to recycle it. There are a few small, well run and interesting recycling projects, but they are not <Col N="274" /> making much of a dent in the overall picture. That is a major gap in these planning guidelines. When the Dublin local authorities and the Government come to do something about this, I hope they do not leave it at one reference in the appendix.</P>
      <P>Where possible, we should concentrate residential development in the centre of Dublin and prevent new industrial and commercial development there. In that way we will begin to rationalise the flow of people from their houses to work and get a more efficient use of the road structure. The treatment of orbital bus services in the planning guidelines is very deficient; page 8 of the report states that there is little demand for them. That is because there are virtually none. We need orbital bus services around the C ring and half way between the C ring and the city to take some of the pressure off the radial routes. Until that is done we will continue to have traffic chaos.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of integration in planning, I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to think very carefully before proceeding with the proposal he seems to have in mind on zonings. He seems to favour zonings adopted under county development plans having a life of five years and that these would be reconsidered with every review of the plan. That has a superficial attraction, but it will make coherent long-term planning extremely difficult if it is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to take the zonings in north Dublin and Fingal, which I represent, developments of some of the 1985 and 1995 zonings have not yet taken place, and I concur with Deputy Dukes on this matter. I hope the Minister rethinks the five year life span in the new Planning Bill. Most of the rezonings in the Fingal area have a ten year lead in period, and that allows people to look at the overall strategy for the towns and villages in the area.</P>
      <P>I concur with the Minister of State that the importance of the issues being addressed in today's debate cannot be overestimated, as they are some of the most fundamental issues facing our society. I have represented north Dublin and the Fingal area since 1985 and have lived in Malahide all my life. I came to the conclusion early in my public life that the issues being debated now would have to be dealt with. I recognised in the late 1980s and early 1990s that from the Hill of Howth to Balbriggan there was no area of serviced land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often asked the Labour speakers about the development plans, as one of the disasters was that those development plans which were meant to be reviewed every five years have become reviewed every ten years. This has led to all sorts of problems in fast developing areas. Hence we have the current debate about section 4 amendments, material contraventions and so forth. The Labour Party opposed every proposal to amend the 1992-93 draft plan which dealt with an area from the town of Balbriggan to the Dub<Col N="275" /> lin mountains on the far side of Tallaght. That party made a policy decision not to support a variation in the plan. Considering the difficulties we face in Dublin today, how much greater would be the crisis if every party had taken the view that land could not be rezoned? On television programmes, Labour Party Ministers make a virtue of the fact that the party was not involved in variations in the 1992-93 plan. One or two decisions relating to that plan may be questionable but the overwhelming majority of decisions were for the betterment of the county and Fingal is now one of the fastest growing local authority areas in the country.</P>
    <P>I have always believed in the benefit of the market forces of supply and demand. If only one developer is operating in a town or city, prices can only go up. Because economic growth has brought people back to Ireland and more of our young people want to live in the Dublin area where jobs are available we face a crisis in house prices. This trend began in the early 1990s and continues today. A limited number of housing units are being built and people are forced to queue overnight to buy houses in new developments. This happened on two successive weekends in Skerries. This is wrong and must be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Government, in commissioning two reports from Dr. Peter Bacon, has tried to implement policies that will ease the housing problem. In 1992, when lands were rezoned, there was no investment in the provision of drainage or serviced land. We dealt with the question of land rezoning in 1992 but serviced land is only now becoming available. It is to the Government's credit that the present investment in drainage will make serviced land available and competition will come into play. A sum of £200 million has been allocated for the north Dublin drainage system and £50 million has been allocated for Swords, Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk. This will ensure that land is serviced, the quality of our bathing water will be maintained at EU standard and our beaches will attain and retain blue flag status.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in her statement earlier today recognised the need for a public transport service to Dublin Airport. Only 30 per cent of people travelling to Dublin Airport do so by public transport. In many cities the corresponding figure is 70 per cent. We cannot simply improve the road network to the airport. Approximately 10 million passengers use Dublin Airport every year. This figure is expected to rise to 20 million and this traffic can only be adequately serviced by public transport.</P>
    <P>I welcome that the possibility of a connection from the Dublin-Belfast railway line through Swords &ndash; which will now become the capital of Fingal &ndash; the airport and on to the western line at Heuston Station is being considered. We should also have a rapid light rail service from the city to the airport. This is essential if people <Col N="276" /> in north Dublin are to gain access to the city for work and travellers are to gain access to the airport. I hope these two decisions regarding Dublin Airport will be made in the context of the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Area action plans will be part of any major development in Fingal. An important feature of the Fingal draft plan is that development will not be permitted before an integrated plan is agreed between planners, investors and developers. Services, roads and community facilities must be in place before planning permission is given for any development. When Fianna Fáil was in opposition our spokesman, Deputy Aylward, published a policy document on sport and leisure. I fully support the idea, included in that document, that planning authorities should insist that community facilities such as playing pitches be in place before any major housing development is built. I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will include that provision in the new planning Bill which is to be brought to the House before the summer. In Fingal, through our own influence and with major developers, we have secured community facilities in an <i>ad hoc </i>way. This should be done in a more structured way with legislative support. The provision of community facilities and other local needs should be a condition of planning permission.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister sees the merit of co-operation between the public and private sectors for infrastructural development. The involvement of the private sector can accelerate the provision of infrastructural needs. I look forward to the publication of the legislation and regulations which can make this happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on 8 December 1998 to allow up to 30 members of the Permanent Defence Force and the Garda Síochána to participate in the Kosovo Verification Mission, KVM, which was established last year by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. It was intended that up to 27 members of the Defence Forces and up to three members of the Garda Síochána would be deployed.</P>
      <P>Five members of the Defence Forces were deployed at the request of the OSCE and served in key appointments with the mission until they were evacuated to Macedonia on the order of the chairman in office of the OSCE on 20 March 1999 in advance of the NATO military action. The deployment of the further 22 military personnel had not been sought by the OSCE. The mission is being downsized from 1,400 personnel approximately to a core group of 200 personnel approximately. The question of whether the five Irish military personnel will be required by the OSCE to remain as part of this core group has yet to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that there is no other mission currently deployed to the Kosovo area. While there has, therefore, been no request for the deployment of troops to the area, any such request, should it be received at a future date, will be considered taking account of,<i> inter alia</i>, the prevailing circumstances, including the security situation, and within the context of the United Nations stand-by arrangements system. As I indicated in the House on 11 November 1998, during the course of my visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 14-17 October 1998, I signed, on behalf of the Government, a <Col N="278" /> memorandum of understanding which commits Ireland to the United Nations stand-by arrangements system.</P>
    <P>UNSAS gives the UN a precise understanding of the forces and other capabilities that Ireland would have available at a given state of readiness for a UN peacekeeping operation. Ireland has committed a maximum of 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under UNSAS. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation.</P>
    <P>As regards the initiative known as SHIRBRIG, this initiative was sponsored by Denmark with a view to the establishment of a high readiness multinational brigade, composed of contributions to the UNSAS with the aim of deploying troops at short notice to troubled spots around the world. Ireland has been keeping a watching brief on this initiative. The question of participation by Ireland in SHIRBRIG is being considered in the light of the legal and practical implications which the concept would raise for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, Kosovo is in the middle of a huge military and political crisis. If the situation should resolve somewhat, does the Minister envisage himself coming back to seek a resolution of the Dáil to involve Irish troops in perhaps peace enforcement in the area if a request is received either via the UN or OSCE? Given the huge humanitarian crisis with over 600,000 refugees moving out of Kosovo, does the Minister see a role in terms of personnel, logistical, medical or accommodation support for the Defence Forces perhaps in the neighbouring countries and supporting them in their efforts to deal with the crisis? Has that been considered? Are we in a position to provide help? Has the Minister had discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now part of the UNSAS arrangement, which is a capacity for a rapid response to emergency circumstances. If a request is made, naturally it will be considered and brought before the Dáil. As the Deputy rightly said, we are dealing with an enormously difficult situation and a human catastrophe of immense proportions. One would have to be there to see its magnitude; we are witnessing it only on television. Any request would be dealt with sympathetically and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Honduras disaster, I requested the Defence Forces to see to what extent we could facilitate and help in that disaster. That disaster and the Kosovo crisis are not comparable but we were able to get a very fast response and already the troops are there. If a request is made, we will do whatever we can in terms of troops which would be required in the aftermath to try to keep the peace under UNSAS and a UN mandate, which would require the agreement of the Dáil, <Col N="279" /> and other facilities which may be provided. This Government and the people would want us to respond positively and sympathetically. We will do what we can within the limits at our disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the people would want to see the Defence Forces getting involved in whatever way possible, particularly in relation to the humanitarian crisis. Given our other commitments, do we have the resources at the moment to provide an emergency response if requested? Are there any actions the Minister could take at this stage to ensure we have the personnel and equipment to respond? Could the Defence Forces support the aid organisations in the neighbouring countries of Albania and Macedonia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are limits to what we can do in terms of numbers, equipment and facilities. We are already fairly heavily committed in Lebanon and other places. Nonetheless, this is the first time for a number of years we have a reserve list waiting to do overseas duties. That such a situation has arisen shows we have at least some resources in terms of personnel and so on which would be available. It is not, however, limitless. The circumstances in which we find ourselves and the catastrophe facing the people in Kosovo and the refugees in the surrounding countries are such that they demand of us to do whatever can do. I would be optimistic that there is a certain amount of resources which we can use in those circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the SHIRBRIG initiative which the Danes launched, does our involvement in that depend on Ireland joining Partnership for Peace? Is that the condition the Minister meant when he said &ldquo;depending on conditions which may arise&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I already made our position clear in the context of the move towards joining Partnership for Peace. As regards the SHIRBRIG, there are legal implications if it comes under OSCE which would not exist if it came under a UN mandate. There are practical considerations in terms of what we could do in Kosovo. The Defence Forces are already in the Lebanon so there are practical implications as regards the resources we can spare at any given time to do a job. There are legal implications under OSCE and practical ones in terms of the resources we have left after we have dealt with the other demands made on us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I asked my Department to prepare proposals for Government for a compensation scheme for serving and former personnel of the Defence Forces who may have suffered hearing disability arising from their service. The scheme will be based on the Green Book which has been broadly accepted by the courts as a fair and reasonable system of assessing disability.</P>
      <P>In setting the proposed level of compensation, I will be mindful of striking an equitable balance between the rights of claimants with genuine injuries and what can be afforded by the taxpayer. I must also have regard to the quantum of damages awarded by the courts in these cases. In this latter connection, it is well known that I have reservations about the tariff established last year in the second test case &ndash; Hanley. Although the Green Book was generally accepted as the basis for the assessment of hearing injury in that case, an additional dimension was added to take account of future hearing loss. This, combined with the tariff, greatly increased the damages indicated in the first test case &ndash; Greene. In response, my Department has consulted experts in the fields of medicine and statistics regarding the modified assessment methodology developed in Hanley. As Deputies are aware, the Supreme Court is not a court of first instance and will, on appeal, deal only with arguments which were first made in the High Court. My difficulty with the prognostic factor introduced in Hanley revolves around the increasing unreliability of any statistical methodology the further into the future it is required to predict. In the case of a 33 year old with zero disability, the Hanley prognostication formula could currently permit an award of up to £9,000 in damages. Furthermore, if the same individual had a 35 per cent hearing disability he would, under the Hanley tariff, receive what I had understood a person with total deafness would otherwise have generally received from the courts.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I have taken advice on whether it would be preferable to address these issues in a third case in the High Court or proceed to seek an early hearing of the Hanley appeal on the basis that sufficient evidence is available in that case to make these arguments in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the Green Book's status as a fair assessment system and assuming a reasonable and affordable tariff emerges from the courts, I do not see the necessity for a tribunal with attendant delay and representation costs. Rather I <Col N="281" /> intend to establish a compensation scheme which will provide for the speedy resolution of claims by reference to established and accepted criteria of assessment and compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister placed great emphasis on reducing the quantum in regard to claims. Is he satisfied that it is low enough to proceed with a compensation scheme? He is reviewing the situation using medical advice and audio experts. Must the Green Book be altered to meet the reservations expressed by the Judiciary in respect of claims before it? Must it be reassessed to meet the demands of representative bodies such that they will agree to a compensation scheme?</P>
      <P>How long will it take to implement the scheme? The Minister has spoken at length in the House about this form of compensation being put to rest, yet it is ongoing and is destroying the morale of the Defence Forces. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us when the scheme will be implemented so that problems in the Defence Forces can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that the Supreme Court case, to which I referred in my reply, will be heard quickly. I will then be extremely anxious to make an announcement in May on the type of compensation scheme envisaged, the tariff involved and on how the board will be established and work.</P>
      <P>There has been a substantial reduction in the quantum awarded over the past two and a half years. It is gradually getting closer to what is affordable and fair. The Green Book has been broadly accepted by the courts but the methodology in terms of determining future hearing loss and disability and the arguments that must be made in the Supreme Court case relating to the Hanley case are such that they should enable us to have a solid basis for proceeding with the compensation scheme. I am extremely anxious to put it in place quickly. I appreciate that a certain amount of damage has been done to the Defence Forces over that time but we need to recover from that. One way is to get broad agreement from all of those involved to proceed in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Once a decision has been taken on the issues I outlined, it will be possible to push ahead with an early Supreme Court hearing. Notwithstanding that, I am extremely anxious to proceed with the compensation scheme as soon as I can and I hope to do so in May. It would be ideal if all the other issues were resolved at that time, but I am mindful of the fact that there have been many representations and inquiries about, and much interest in, the scheme. Deputies Fitzgerald and Wall have made representations on the basis that the scheme is likely to succeed. I am prepared one way or the other to proceed on the basis of what I outlined. I hope to get everything right beforehand but that may not be possible. However, I will not wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The key question is what form of assessment will be used. It is clear from the court cases two weeks ago that the Green Book is continually being chipped away at by decisions in court. Does the Minister accept, even though the Green Book received all party support, that if he is to proceed and set up a compensation scheme, modification of the book will be essential if he is to get broad agreement from all concerned, including the representative associations and lawyers?</P>

      <P>Given our experience in court since the publication of the Green Book, there must be a learning curve in terms of how we formulate a compensation scheme which takes account of everything that has happened since then. The main thrust will still be based on the book but account will be taken of experiences in the interim because I want the scheme to succeed. I want to be able to save money, particularly in regard to the astronomical legal costs, and attract the majority of litigants to the scheme in their interest and that of the Defence Forces and taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Which experts will the Minister call on to draw up the scheme? Does he envisage using the same experts as were used in the production of the Green Book? Is a wider range of expertise needed to ensure that scheme will end the problems we have had with this issue? That would be necessary to meet the demands of the representative associations. I am concerned that if the same people are used we will initially find it difficult to get off the ground with the representative associations and those who have cases before the courts.</P>

      <P>I am extremely grateful to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and those who were selected for the preparation of the first proper assessment of hearing disability. All of them are eminent experts in their fields. We can safely say that everything they said has been tried and tested. In the meantime we are examining other experiences. I never said I would appoint these individuals to the compensation board, nor did I intend to do so. Their advice and work is an essential part of how we proceed, but the compensation scheme, the composition of the board and how compensation will be paid are separate matters from the nominees who prepared the book in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Just over 11,000 cases remain to be decided and new cases are coming in at the rate of 100 per month. While that is considerably lower than it was, it is still a disturbing part of the problem. If one were to solve this on the basis of the Hanly judgment, the existing cases would cost about £550 million, as well as legal costs of another few hundred million pounds. There is no way the compensation scheme we are designing will cost that much. We are getting a significant discount on the damages in the Hanly case in our negotiations before the court, through argument, etc. As the quantum progressively reduces the final estimate will be some hundreds of millions less than that figure. That relates to current claims, I am in no position to indicate where this will end.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the reason it was necessary to set up a steering group to oversee the work of the military board conducting a study of the Reserve.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9443/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 &ndash; which was approved by Government in March 1996 &ndash; provides for a special study of the Reserve to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the Chief of Staff had already established a military board to conduct a study of the Reserve. In addition, a considerable amount of work had already been undertaken by earlier military boards set up to seek the views of the membership on the future organisation and structure of the Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the need to undertake an indepth and wide-ranging study or review of the Reserve <Col N="284" /> Defence Force and to ensure all aspects of the Reserve were comprehended by the study I considered it desirable that l should set up a broadly-based steering group to oversee and guide the military board in its study. Accordingly, the steering group, as part of its function, oversees and guides the military board in its task. The membership of the steering group comprises an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from my Department and a serving officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil. No member of the steering group is a member of the military board.</P>
    <P>From the outset there has been ongoing liaison between the steering group and the military board and meetings of the steering group are attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who keep the group well briefed on the board's progress. The group also advises the military board regarding aspects of the Reserve that should be examined or that should be examined in greater depth by the board.</P>
    <P>The steering group met each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and on three occasions it met the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, which also made presentations to it.</P>
    <P>As the military board study is nearing completion it is anticipated that the board will be in a position to submit its final report shortly. The steering group, which will have regard to the military board's report, will submit its final report to me as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not strange that the Chief of Staff set up a board in November 1997 and the Minister set up a similar group a few weeks later? There is a lot of duplication with both groups, broadly speaking, carrying out the same function. When will we see the steering group's final report? Has the Minister any idea of the timescale, will it be three months, six months, this year or next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to win. If we only had a military board examining the Reserve, I am sure Deputy Stanton would say it was incestuous. To ensure the most comprehensive examination, we used a military board, which has existed for years and examined various matters, and a steering group. We hope to have a better, more comprehensive and fairer result from that process, from everyone's viewpoint. I expect the final report soon and will be disappointed if we are not dealing conclusively with it within the next three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to indicate that one of his areas of responsibility &ndash; namely, the military &ndash; did not keep the Department informed of what it was doing and, as a result, two groups were set up within months of each other. This begs the question of why this was so, <Col N="285" /> and I am not happy with the answer. The groups should have been set up in tandem if there had been co-ordination. It is obvious the Minister's group was set up to keep an eye on the other group. Has the Minister plans to announce initiatives pertaining to the Reserve in the near future and has he booked venues for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Some venues may be booked for normal Defence Forces activities over the next year. The economy is doing so well that we have to plan in advance for accommodation, and the Deputy should be grateful that is the case. As far as initiatives are concerned, I will await the report. I want to be a good friend of the Reserve and from my background I have a deep appreciation of its members' voluntary commitment and its importance to many parts of the country. My decision to establish the steering group was a fair-minded one. The groups were not set up in tandem because I took up this job in October 1997 and I moved quickly to take this action. It is not a question of one body looking at another, that is the way things are often done in the military. That happened in the other reviews also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are some of the venues mentioned by the Minister in his constituency? Does he agree it is important to have a strong Reserve, given the dreadful events in Europe? As the Government has adopted the Fine Gael policy on Partnership for Peace, we need to be able to play our part in that body and a strong Reserve will be vital for that, given the humanitarian emergency unfolding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the FCA has been the poor relation through the years? In the first two years of training, 64 per cent of FCA personnel leave. There are a number of reasons for this &ndash; it takes 12 months for an FCA member to be issued with a combat uniform, 18 months before he or she is issued with what is called service dress No. 1, and there are only ten sets of wet gear to every 40 or 50 FCA members. I do not blame the Minister for this, but will he give a commitment, irrespective of whether this is mentioned in the study of the Reserve, that small administrative matters like these will be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That was partly the position in the past. There has been a radical improvement under all Administrations in recent years to ensure equipment, clothing needs and matters of that kind are addressed. I am taking on board the out<Col N="286" /> standing issues. None of these matters should have to await the outcome of the review. Of the approximately £23 million spent per year on the Reserve, £17 million goes on pay. While that is not a tiny figure, there is scope for improvement. Issues in respect of accommodation, equipment and clothing needs will not have to await the outcome of the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of approaches have been made in recent months by private concerns regarding the possible use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for commercial use. The greater utilisation of this underused resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Baldonnel is a fairly important national resource. It has the capacity to do more. As Minister for Defence, my primary responsibility is to look after the interests of the Air Corps and to enhance and improve the infrastructure and facilities there. If we were in a position to deal successfully with the proposals put forward, the aircraft would have to be improved in a much shorter timescale. If agreement could be reached, legislative changes would be required because the Aviation Authority Act does not cover military aerodromes and discussions would have to take place with the Department of Public Enterprise, given the opposition in different circles to the use Baldonnel Aerodrome on a more commercial basis. The people we have met recently are private concerns but the broader question of the more commercial use is entwined. No one decision could be taken without the other. I am in favour of opening up a debate on the more realistic use of that resource in view of the benefits that would accrue to both sides and particularly because of the demand for resources to improve the aircraft there in the next nine or ten years. I cannot depend on going to the taxpayer for all the resources. If there is any other way in which I can accelerate improvements to the aircraft I want to open up the possibility of doing that in the interests of the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>There is a view that the infrastructure at Dublin Airport is capable of coping with the expected growth in travel to Ireland and enormous investment has been made there. If traffic were directed away from Dublin Airport by this exercise it would not be as important a growth facility as it otherwise could be. These are questions that have to be debated. Let us debate them openly and see what type of exercises can be undertaken, with whom we can negotiate and the legislative change which would be necessary to free up that system.</P>

      <P>To be eligible for enlistment in An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, potential recruits are required to meet the eligibility requirements as regards age, height and medical standards as prescribed in Defence Forces regulations. The determinants governing medical classification of FCA recruits include the applicant's year of birth, constitution, military fitness, keenness of vision, colour vision and keenness of hearing.</P>
      <P>The medical examination of potential recruits is, where practicable, conducted by a medical officer of the medical corps at military medical centres where audiometry facilities are available. The diversity of FCA recruitment centres makes it impossible to have all medical examinations conducted by medical officers of the medical corps and where this is not possible, local general medical practitioners may be engaged to medically examine potential recruits. In such cases, a medical examination sheet is completed by the general medical practitioner in respect of each potential recruit examined, and is then forwarded to the medical officer of the relevant brigade for decision as to whether the examinee is of the required medical standard for enlistment. On being found otherwise medically fit for enlistment in the FCA, all potential recruits must then have a screening audiogram to ensure their hearing meets the required standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Audiometry facilities are available in Defence Forces medical centres in Dublin, in the Defence Forces training centre, Curragh Camp, and in <Col N="289" /> Baldonnel, Athlone, Cork, Galway and Limerick. It is proposed to extend the facilities to Monaghan in the near future. Potential recruits may be conveyed by military transport to the nearest centre for their screening audiogram.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting question. When I came into office I made a slight change in favour of reducing by one inch the requirement for women to five foot four inches and for men to five foot five inches. Different practices apply in different countries. The general view in the military here is that because of the exercises and the amount of weight that has to be carried a certain height and weight requirement is essential for these demands. The practice in other countries is not to have minimum height or weight requirements. The training programmes are then adjusted in terms of the weights carried and people carrying below certain levels do not participate in various exercises. In Ireland men and women are expected to perform equal duties and carry equal weights. However, I am not an expert on this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument in that area is slightly different.

      <P>Regarding the Deputy's second question, the alarming failure rate in the southern command last year disturbed me greatly. However, I am happy a re-examination of all the applicants who failed was allowed and my recollection is that 63 passed and nine failed.

      <P>Research carried out in the University of Limerick shows there is no correlation between height and the ability to carry certain weights. The Minister said he discriminated positively in favour of females. However, I must disagree because the differentiation in the average height between males and females is greater than one inch. Therefore, a greater percentage of females are excluded from applying for membership of the Defence Forces on the basis of the current height requirement. Will the Minister consider reducing the female height requirement by a further inch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this argument previously. It has been said that I am excluding females from contributing to the Defence Forces, but the Deputy's party presided over a situation where many more of them were excluded because the height requirement was five feet five inches. I am prepared to re-examine the matter. As I said to Deputy Dukes, I am not an expert in this field and I do not know the right answers in relation to height and the ability to carry weights.</P>
      <P>However, in my playing days a person who was five foot three or four inches tall injured me as much as somebody who was six feet tall when they hit me at 30 miles an hour. I will undertake to re-examine the area and consider whether further changes can be made. I do not pretend to be an expert on this area, but my advice is based on sound military and medical experience.</P>

      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally.</P>
      <P>It is expected that £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks. A total of 60 per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and equipment. The balance will be used to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures have taken place.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were subsequently evacuated. In addition to those initial meetings, my officials met councillors and officials of Kildare County Council in relation to Magee Barracks on 11 February 1999. I expect to meet representatives of the county council in the near future to discuss the matter further. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>

We are still engaged in local consultations and are anxious to conclude work with the local authority on the lay-out and development of the site to enhance Kildare town. Once this work is completed, I will outline what will happen on the site. I do not want to limit the horizons for the people <Col N="292" /> of the town but I understand the proposal did not find favour because proposals had already been made to develop a museum on another site.

      <P>There are a number of considerations on the table. Collins Barracks is developed but it needs further development. In addition, another site is under consideration. In Kildare, we are trying to reach a conclusion with local community and local authority interests on the sale of the site. I will not be involved in what happens on the site after this process is completed. The Deputy and others will probably be more involved than me in what happens on the site. The other proposals relate to existing sites and premises that are within the Department's domain.</P>

In the context of properties outside of the barracks, there are individual properties which we will be able to sell which do not involve the closure of barracks. I said before that I had done my stint in trying to make changes in this area and that is as far as I will go at this stage. If the Deputy has any suggestions and can secure the agreement of his Front Bench spokesperson to give me the list, I will look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 115 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. Other tasks carried out by the Naval Service include search and rescue operations, aid to the civil power, drugs interdiction at sea, salmon fishery <Col N="294" /> patrols and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements. I propose to maintain a policy of continuous recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force and in this regard a recruitment campaign for over 500 general service recruits has just been launched. The first intake of 275 recruits, of which approximately 65 will be allocated to the Naval Service, will be enlisted in the near future. Seventeen apprentices are also being recruited and a competition for the recruitment of 14 cadets into the Naval Service will be advertised by my Department shortly.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. A new fishery protection patrol vessel is currently under construction and is due to be delivered in September next.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process has been set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. I have asked the Chief of Staff in conjunction with the GOC of the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked for a submission from the Chief of Staff to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State which would form the basis of the longer-term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service and which will be supported by the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency measures. I understand that a considerable amount of work has been done and I would expect to receive draft proposals for my consideration in the near future. These proposals will include, <i>inter alia</i>, organisation, personnel, infrastructure and options in relation to future equipment for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider the seven vessels the Naval Service has to patrol 132,000 square miles of water, 16 per cent of EU marine territory, adequate in number? What plans has he made to ensure there is adequate protection in our seas to deal with fishery protection, to interrupt possible drug importation and to monitor what is happening in our seas at an environmental level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that in the past we were not as conscious of the need to protect the sea. It is also true that our resources can be stretched to meet a mix of commitments. We are upgrading and refurbishing the existing fleet; the new ship will be ready in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated to the House previously that I would like to move on to the next stage, the <Col N="295" /> ongoing programme for acquisition of new ships. That will also alleviate the problem when a number of vessels of the existing fleet come to the end of their life span. Unless plans have been made in advance, when that happens there will be significant problems.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is committed to the recruitment programmes, notwithstanding the fact that in the present economic climate a number of technical people have left for other posts. We will continue to work on that front. When the implementation plan is in place, I will establish an exercise which will enhance those numbers over time. It will not be done over night and there are other competing considerations for the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of technical staff is leaving the Naval Service? What initiatives has the Minister put in place to encourage such important people to remain in the Naval Service? Is he happy to see such a haemorrhage continue unchallenged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number recruited to the Naval Service last year was 80 and a slightly higher number retired or took up alternative positions. My recollection is that about 30 per cent of those people were in technical grades and that causes a strain on our engineering and technical resources. We must make sure that pay, conditions and allowances are attractive. That is why last year I made sure that special recognition was given to the day allowance for people in the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The other matter is more complex. In the IT and engineering fields we have developed great expertise which is valuable to other industries and services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister committed to the future of the Navy as a multi-tasked agency? Does he envisage it providing coastguard duties in the future? What steps has he taken to devolve authority to the flag officer commanding the Navy so that decisions can be taken within the Navy rather than in the centralised way that operates at present? Is he planning to arrange for its headquarters to be moved to Haulbowline and, if so, when is this likely to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Delegation and the granting of autonomy to the different arms of the Defence Forces is strongly recommended in the Price Waterhouse review. Approximately 65 per cent of the non-pay area of the Defence Forces has been delegated. In regard to the review and the implementation plan, the same practice will continue in the Navy. I have no doubt that exercise will work to the fullest extent possible.</P>
      <P>The decision to base the headquarters at Haulbowline was a key proposal in the Price Waterhouse review and it is an important element of good management practice, which I strongly support. I want to indicate my commitment to the Navy by making sure the programme and future plans proceed at full pace.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy asked if I am committed to the future of the Navy. I work 24 hours a day for these people. As long as I can, I will continue to improve matters. I have done that by investing in infrastructure and equipment. All the Deputy needs to do is take account of the scale of investment in the Navy and Air Corps over the last four years. A total of £10 million was invested four years ago, £15 million three years ago, £27 million two years ago and then there are the figures of £30 million and £37 million. That graph has climbed upwards and I intend to ensure it continues to do so. The best sign of my commitment to the Navy is to put my money where my mouth is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the division of responsibilities between the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Defence. Is the Minister committed to the Navy being the agency that will carry out the multi-tasks in terms of fishery protection and a coastguard service? If it is to do that, it will require investment in a greater variety of fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood the question. I am committed to that kind of develop<Col N="297" /> ment. We cannot allow every agency to have responsibility for everything. There is room for co-operation. We have a multi-tasked and multi-faceted service. A number of functions can be carried out in tandem which will involve virtually no additional cost. In regard to the review and the implementation phase, we must make sure the efficiencies and effectiveness of that are such that we can compete with anyone who is anxious to promote an alternative view. We must ensure we use the resources we have to best effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M Smith Mr. M Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Deputy Wall made that point. We made many mistakes in the past by spending a good deal of money advertising nationally when recruitment programmes should have been targeted at schools. Videos should be shown in schools and students should hear the experiences of those who have lived at sea. This would encourage the small proportion of people who have an interest in pursuing a career at sea. It is important to home in on them. We have worked with the schools in the past few years. They are the best indication of where new recruits will come from. We will concentrate virtually exclusively on the second level sector.</P>

      <P>I have been to Haulbowline on a number of occasions and it is a very upbeat place. The Deputy probably had an opportunity to see the new galley on which we spent £2 million. It is a beautiful spot where one can look out at the sea. If one were dining there every morning and evening, one's morale could not but be high. It is a good place to be. Having regard to competition from the private commercial sector in the recruitment of people with special expertise, we have to continually consider other options to retain the type of leadership potential so necessary for the future. Many Deputies speak of the morale in the service, but when I meet the personnel I find them very upbeat. That is not to say there are not problems. A review and talk of change creates a certain amount of pressure. It is important that we proceed with the implementation phase fairly quickly. Personnel have seen a new ship being built and more investment in their infrastructure and facilities. There is a limit to what we can do, but personnel is an important area that requires constant attention and the introduction of new innovative proposals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-1998, which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the First Line Reserve, An Fóras Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, is taking place at present. In that regard, there is a consultative process in train, which is intended to elicit the views of serving members on the future <Col N="299" /> organisation and structure of the reserve. The representative bodies are also involved in this process. The role of the Reserve Forces and their training are being examined as part of this special study, which will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>At present, however, pending the outcome of the ongoing study, the FCA provides training for volunteer personnel to meet a local defence role, which enables its units to provide military security in their own areas and relieve units of the Permanent Defence Force in those areas should circumstances so require. An Slua Muirí, which is the Naval component of the Reserve Defence Force, trains personnel to assist the Naval Service in a range of supporting roles. In addition, members of the Reserve Defence Force are occasionally employed on security duties.</P>
    <P>As has been the case for some years now, the provision in the 1999 Vote for Defence provides for seven day periods of annual training and 14 day courses of instruction for members of the FCA and the Slua Muirí.</P>
    <P>An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, which form the Second Line Reserve, are voluntary organisations and in the circumstances the commitment and dedication of their members cannot be commended too highly. The contribution of members of the Reserve Forces to the community is considerable and is recognised and valued throughout the country. </P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the annual period of training for the FCA was cut back from 14 days to seven days a number of years ago as a result of economic conditions? Would he also agree that, given his frequent reminders of how well Ireland is doing, it is time to revert to the two-week training programme which pertained for years? What is the FCA's role in providing security in its own areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the last election and in the House since then, I stated that I was anxious to return to the 14-day training period for the FCA as soon as possible. I indicated that this would not happen in 1999 but I was anxious for it to happen in 2000. I have had discussions with RDFRA and there seems to be two opinions concerning this issue. This is largely due to the fact that it is becoming more difficult for members to get away for two weeks. They have an interest in weekend and shorter training camps alongside the seven-day arrangement. As we conclude the review, I will listen carefully to what they have to say. I have no objection to making a provision to revert to the 14-day training period. However, it looks as if a more tailored programme will emerge to take account of the circumstances in which individuals are finding it difficult to spend that length of time away. I am taking on board the Deputy's proposition of extending the arrangements.</P>

      <P>Sixty three thousand man days have been allocated to the FCA in 1999. Based on the fact that the FCA has 14,000 members, this would enable only 9,000 members to avail of the week's training. Will the Minister confirm that this arrangement will exclude 5,000 members?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is reasonably good at mathematics but his judgment falters after that. It is not the case that 5,000 members are excluded. The Reserve Defence Forces has just short of 14,000 members. However, the seven-day training opportunity is afforded to all those in a position to avail of it. No one is being excluded who wants to take part or who is available to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 51, 67, 86, 113 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>A fact-finding team led by the Ambassador of Ireland to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and including two officers of the Defence Forces, visited Kosovo from 6 to 11 November 1998. Their report recommended that it would be desirable that Ireland agree to participate in the Kosovo Verification Mission, KVM, which was established last year by the OSCE.</P>
      <P>On 8 December 1998, the Government decided to allow up to 30 members of the Permanent Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána to participate in the mission. It was intended that up to 27 members of the Defence Forces and up to three members of An Garda Síochána would be deployed.</P>
      <P>Five members of the Defence Forces were deployed at the request of the OSCE and served in key appointments with the mission until they were evacuated to Macedonia on the order of the Chairman in Office of the OSCE, on 20 March 1999 in advance of the NATO military action. The deployment of the further 22 military personnel had not been sought by the OSCE.</P>
      <P>The mission is being downsized from 1,400 personnel approximately to a core group of 200 personnel approximately. The question of whether the five Irish military personnel will be required by the OSCE to remain as part of this core group has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that there is no other mission currently deployed to the Kosovo area. While there has not been a request for the deployment of troops to the area, any such request, should it be received at a future date, will be considered taking account of,<i> inter alia</i>, the prevailing circumstances, including the security situation and within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are these personnel currently located? Do we still have troops stationed in Bosnia? Does the Minister share my concern, given that the situation seems out of control and attacks could occur on the ground? Having signed the Amsterdam Treaty and the Petersberg Tasks which include crisis management and averting humanitarian crises, could Irish troops find themselves on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We signed the Amsterdam Treaty which involves commitments in the Petersberg Tasks. The Government is placing the emphasis on peace keeping and humanitarian aid. The troops have been evacuated to Macedonia. There are about 50 troops in Bosnia. We are in constant touch to ensure that the safety of our personnel is guaranteed to the limit possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What resources does the Minister have available to respond to a request to send in an emergency team in addition to the forces already in the area? Has he discussed this scenario with the Chief of Staff? Many Members share the Minister's expressed wish that we should have an emergency team of Defence Forces personnel who would be able to respond to international humanitarian crises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When the crisis arose in Honduras I discussed the situation with the Chief of Staff and we were able to assemble a core team quickly. These personnel are currently in Honduras and were visited by the President in recent days. The UNSAS agreement with the UN obliges us to respond rapidly to any emergency which should arise within the resources available. I have not had recent discussions with the Chief of Staff on this issue as we are a little distance from such a request. However, we will give it immediate consideration if it arrives, within the resources available. Should it arise I will come back to the House for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that he has an <i>à la carte</i> approach to the Petersberg Tasks? Is he saying he can pick and choose as he sees fit? Is it not the case that we signed up to this agreement and for the Petersberg Tasks and that we cannot simply cherry pick, as the Minister is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the high probability of Ireland being asked to accommodate refugees from Kosovo, does the Minister envisage using some of the Army barracks which were recently vacated and which would obviously meet the demands that might arise at short notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the Government is concerned with ensuring that it provides as much financial support as possible to the aid agencies involved, such as the International Red Cross, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the European Union Humanitarian Office. That will ensure that as much as possible will be done for these people where they are at present. That is the most urgent task at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to this country must be seen as a last resort for the refugees given the distance involved. If that happens, we must take a humanitarian view with regard to the facilities we can provide. These people love their homeland and they want to return to it. Their homes have been burnt and they need help in many different ways. The hope is that there will be a quick return to peace, after which they can return to their homeland and pick up their normal lives and work. In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, I will <Col N="303" /> make whatever facilities I can available in the context of the demands that might be made on me at that time.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Deputy Gormley has the single agenda of trying to find something terribly wrong with a country which has grown up, become a mature nation and is interested in playing the best possible international role it can in whatever field it is required. One of the reasons we concentrate on the Petersberg Tasks in the context of humanitarian aid and peacekeeping is the experience we have gained over 40 years of working in those areas. Ireland has a great deal of expertise and its people are welcomed all over the world when doing this work. We will apply our efforts to areas where our strengths lie&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on these issues. I listened to the Labour Party speakers earlier. They were full of talk about crises and chaos in housing. That is terrible hypocrisy. I listen to them regularly at local authority meetings where they say the same thing. One week in Dublin Corporation they were declaring a housing crisis but a couple of days later they blocked every possible application to build extra houses. Some people try to have both sides of the coin and as a result get extremely confused.</P>
      <P>There was a major debate on this matter at city council level in Dublin last week. Labour Party representatives and others walked out in a most undemocratic manner when they could not get their way. They demand houses but they block the building of houses at every possible opportunity. That simply does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some politicians, particularly Labour Party politicians, have given rezoning a bad name. If houses are to be built, they must be built on land. Looking at how the city has developed and expanded over the decades, one can see that new houses must be built in green field sites and that that can only be done by rezoning land. I do not stand over every rezoning decision. Obviously <Col N="305" /> there were some errors. Human nature means there will be failures and failures have occurred. However, we cannot allow rezoning to have a bad name. We must acknowledge that if we want more housing, we must provide the land.</P>
    <P>The main problems in the housing market relate to success and prosperity. There is huge growth in the number of young people in the 20 to 30 years age group who are buying houses. There is also huge net immigration. The demographic experts obviously provided the wrong information ten and 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>The housing market is about supply and demand. The measures outlined by the Minister of State are working but they will take time. One cannot simply click one's fingers and produce houses in a field. It takes a year or two for the measures one adopts to show results. However, the swift Government action following the Bacon report is having and will continue to have an effect. The huge amount of money being invested in the serviced land initiative is the right course to take. It is directed at providing more houses. Approximately 42,000 extra houses were built last year. If that policy can be continued for the next couple of years, it will break the back of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government is the lead Department in this area. It has done much good work. However, other Departments should get involved. My constituency, although it comprised the same geographic area ten years ago, was a four seater constituency. Now it is a three seater. There is the same number of houses but the population has decreased. This is the empty nest syndrome. Many houses in my constituency, private and local authority, which were once inhabited by families are now inhabited by widows. The Department should examine innovative measures to try to recycle some of those houses. I am opposed to somebody being forced out of the house in which they raised their families but there are ways, private and public, to encourage them to move. If other houses are provided, they will move and make better use of those houses.</P>
    <P>Several Departments, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance, could play a role in housing but so far they have not been drawn in. I meet many widows who say that if they take in a lodger or rent out part of their house, they will have to pay tax on the income and will lose their free schemes and living alone allowance. They virtually have to evict their sons if they are unemployed because they cannot get the dole if they are living at home. If the son leaves home, he qualifies for rent allowance and the dole.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government is doing great work but it must try to involve other Departments. The Department of Health and Children could have a role. It would be a great help if there were shel<Col N="306" /> tered and secure units with medical facilities nearby which were suitable for elderly people. The Departments need to pull together. There must be a realisation that up to five Departments have a role and responsibility in tackling the housing problem. Much could be achieved.</P>
    <P>People talk about the huge numbers on local authority waiting lists. They claim that thousands of young couples are waiting for houses. That is emotive talk. In Dublin city only 12 per cent of the people on the housing list are couples with children; 59 per cent are lone parents and 20 per cent are single people. We talk about the nice young couple but the vast majority of these people are lone parents or single persons. We seem to broaden the housing list every year to take in additional people who previously would not have qualified.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity of making a statement to the House today concerning a recent court case, the general handling of which has been the subject of the most serious allegations in this House and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I preface my remarks by reminding the House that the events we are discussing today arise from a most awful tragedy for the family of the lady who was killed in 1996. I am sensitive, as I am sure are Members of the House, to the pain and distress these recent events have caused.</P>
      <P>I make it clear that this is a preliminary statement and I will not be in a position to make a definitive statement until such time as inquiries now under way have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also make it clear that, although I am aware suggestions have been made concerning the alleged involvement of named individuals outside of this House in connection with the handling of the case in question, I do not consider myself at liberty to use the privilege of the House to discuss or detail those suggestions pending the completion of the investigation now under way. It would represent an outrageous invasion of basic personal rights if this House, and particularly a Minister in this House, thought it acceptable, in effect, to act as judge and jury in the case of named individuals who have not had the opportunity of putting their point of view in the course of the investigations still under way which are, in part, intended to afford them such an opportunity. There is another compelling reason for not <Col N="307" /> getting into minute detail at this stage. I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>I will inform the House of the circumstances in which this case came to my notice and that of my Department and outline the action I took in the matter.</P>
    <P>The prisoner in question was produced in court on 12 November 1998 and released by the court on the same date. The first query received by my Department about this matter was on Thursday, 4 February 1999 when a letter addressed to the Minister for Justice, 72 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2 arrived in my Department. It read as follows:</P>
    <P>Re John Ryan, Tymon Crescent, Old Bawn, Tallaght, Dublin 24.</P>
    <P>Date of accident 15/3/'96. J. Ryan &ndash; v &ndash; P. Sheedy.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I enclose herewith copy letter sent to the Governor of Shanganagh Prison, Shankill, Co. Dublin.</P>
    <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P>Edward T. O'Connor &amp; Co.</P>
    <P>The enclosure was a letter addressed to the Governor protesting that the Ryan family had not been notified of the release of an offender who had been involved in a car accident in which their client's wife had died. They noted that &ldquo;we are still a number of months short of the review date&rdquo;. This correspondence, which did not refer to any allegation of irregularity or court hearing, was acknowledged by the private secretary in my office on Friday, 5 February and transmitted to the prisons section in the Department for whatever action was deemed appropriate. An examination of the prisoner's file indicated no irregularities in that, as I have already said, the prisoner was released by court. Former Ministers for Justice in this House will know that solicitors' offices frequently copy letters to the Department in this way and they are normally associated with the relevant offender file in the prisons section. This correspondence was not brought to my notice at the time.</P>
    <P>On the following Wednesday night, 10 February, I received a telephone call from the Attorney General in Berlin where I was attending an EU meeting. The Attorney General informed me that he had been approached by the Director of Public Prosecutions over the fact that the State had not received any advance notice of the application of the Circuit Court which resulted in the early release of Mr. Sheedy from prison. Of particular concern was that there were rumours to the effect that the listing of the case and/or the fact that the State had not received advance notification may have been brought about by improper practice, as distinct from error or omission, in the courts. During that conversation, I decided that an inquiry should be established and the Attorney General said he would inform the Chief Justice, which I understand he did the following day, and I decided to inform the Commissioner of the <Col N="308" /> Garda. The following morning I telephoned the Secretary General of my Department and asked that the Garda Commissioner should investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>On the same morning, the Secretary General telephoned the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, in the absence of the Commissioner, and asked him what information he had on the matter. He also obtained some outline factual information on the case in the Department. The Secretary General spoke that morning to the Attorney General who gave him an account of what the DPP had said to him. He later spoke to the DPP.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the various contacts which took place between the Secretary General, the Garda authorities and separately with the DPP, it became clear to him that it would not be appropriate to initiate a criminal investigation at that time, particularly against the background where the Director of Public Prosecutions was about to initiate judicial review proceedings, which have since taken place. The DPP was of the view that a criminal investigation would, in all the circumstances, be premature, and that view was shared by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I also decided that official level inquiries should proceed, conducted in such a way as not to jeopardise the upcoming court proceedings.</P>
    <P>On 16 February my Department contacted the county registrar and requested him to provide a written report on the matter. There has also been subsequent contact and correspondence with the county registrar arising from the replies he provided. This included a telephone call from the county registrar as late as this morning which included information relevant to my Department's inquiries. As the earlier correspondence with the county registrar suggested it would be necessary to contact the Chief State Solicitor, my Department also wrote to him on 24 February and again on 3 March seeking more information. I received a reply to these letters on 31 March. I will refer again to this response later in my statement. It is important. As these contacts are so recent and are ongoing it has not been possible to finalise Department inquiries just yet.</P>
    <P>Separate inquiries have also been instituted by the Chief Justice into this matter. It seems to me this is the appropriate course to follow because it may be necessary to address queries to a member or members of the Judiciary in this regard.</P>
    <P>While I do not intend to go into the details of the information so far to hand, for the reason I gave earlier, it is right that I should specifically refer to the reply I received yesterday evening from the Chief State Solicitor's office. That reply included a detailed file note in which an official outlined various contacts he had with people in the courts who, according to him, had a part in the listing of the case for 12 November 1998.</P>
    <P>Upon receipt of this material &ndash; which, incidentally, I received by fax in Belfast, where I have been attending the Northern talks &ndash; I immediately requested the Attorney General to refer the <Col N="309" /> matter to the President of the Circuit Court and to inform the Chief Justice that he had done so. I did this as it seemed right, on the basis of the contents of this note, that a member or members of the Judiciary should be invited to comment on certain matters.</P>
    <P>I should mention in connection with the document I received from the Chief State Solicitor's office yesterday that I sought further advice from the Attorney General on the whole question of the initiation of a Garda investigation. On my way out of the Department this evening I received a further letter from the county registrar about this matter, following on a telephone conversation with the Secretary General of my Department this morning.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some totally outrageous innuendos which were made behind the shield of Dáil privilege yesterday morning concerning my part in this matter. I had no hand, act or part in any aspect of the listing or the handling of this case. I neither received nor made requests to anybody in this regard and I had no knowledge about it until I was telephoned by the Attorney General on 10 February last.</P>
    <P>As I said outside this House yesterday, any Minister for Justice who would engage in the kind of criminal, underhand behaviour which some Members opposite are trying to imply, would not only be unfit to be a Minister but would be unfit to be a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the mindset of a person who, despite the fact that she held the office of Minister for Justice, somehow thinks it is fair game, without a shred of substance or evidence, to accuse another Member of this House of what would, in effect, be serious criminal conduct. I sincerely hope she will now avail of this opportunity to withdraw that imputation. I regard it as particularly sad and outrageous that this allegation should have been made in this House against me, particularly when I was not and could not be present to defend myself, because every individual has the right to his good name.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> This is an extremely serious matter. Its gravity is underlined by what the Minister said here today. It is further underlined by the omissions in the Minister's text, and we will look for the gaps to be filled in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at issue here is the credibility of an essential instrument of our democracy and criminal justice system, the courts. What is at issue here is whether the bizarre set of circumstances surrounding the release of Philip Sheedy three years earlier than he should have been freed were accidental or were deliberately contrived. Whether the manifestly wrongful handling of this case was deliberate or accidental, one thing is certain. The handling of this case was a major cock-up. I cannot accept that the affair was the result an administrative oversight or error, or ignorance on the part of the judge that he was not empowered to hear the case. One might be tempted to accept as an oversight one administrative blun<Col N="310" /> der. However, the litany of irregularities in this case is simply too long to be credible.</P>
    <P>It was wrong to list this case for hearing on 12 November 1998. When the application for listing arrived on the desk of the registrar, it would have been examined, and it would have been patently obvious that the case could not be listed for hearing because the defendant, Mr. Sheedy, had already forfeited his right of review of sentence in November 1997. The application and the file should have been rejected and sent back, and the applicants should have been told they were in the wrong court and had two options, to make application to the Court of Criminal Appeal or to the High Court. This did not happen. The case was listed and was duly heard.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that when a judge on the Bench hearing an appeal is furnished with a detailed file setting out the facts of the original hearing, who the presiding judge was in the first case, the comments of the judge in passing sentence, and the details of the sentence itself, the file has to be complete. The moment Judge Kelly saw that his colleague in the same court, Judge Matthews, was the presiding judge who passed sentence in the original case, he should immediately have rejected the application, pointing out that he was not empowered to hear the case, and advising the applicants to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal or to a superior court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> What happened was seriously wrong. That is why, on 23 February, Mr. Justice Barr gave the Director of Public Prosecutions leave for a judicial review to set aside Judge Kelly's ruling. That is why last Thursday Mr. McEntee, on behalf of Mr. Sheedy, withdrew any objection to the DPP's application. That is why Ms Justice Lafoy quashed Judge Kelly's order and the defendant is back in prison today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other imponderables. For example, what or who prompted Mr. Sheedy, a mere month after being given the right by Judge Mathews for a review of sentence after two years, to return to court to ask that this right be set aside? Who advised him to do so. Why was he so advised, and what scenario was held out to him? We are no wiser as to why Mr. Sheedy, having signed a very strongly worded affidavit objecting to the DPP's application, suddenly abandoned his affidavit and the arguments contained therein on the day of the hearing and returned voluntarily to Mountjoy jail to serve out the remainder of his sentence. Who was he trying to shield? Why, for <Col N="311" /> example, did Mr. Sheedy change his legal team? Why did Michael J. Staines and Company, now acting on behalf of Mr. Sheedy, having signed an affidavit attempting to underpin the right of Judge Kelly to hear the review of sentence case, suddenly abandon his affidavit and arguments on the steps of the court last Thursday?</P>
    <P>Both sides must be heard in any argument. This goes to the core of the judicial system. To try to imply that the State was represented because a junior clerk brought the file to court and because there were representatives of the key State solicitors who were dealing with other files chatting at the back of the court is ludicrous. The State should have been properly notified and properly represented. This did not happen. The Garda Síochána should have been notified, should have been in court, and should have been afforded an opportunity to present their views. This did not happen.</P>
    <P>Apart from all the special treatment and consideration afforded by the judicial process to Mr. Sheedy, another intriguing issue is his early transfer to Shelton Abbey. Only when one becomes a trustee prisoner does one get a transfer to an open prison. It generally happens towards the end of one's sentence as one prepares for release. In the Elio Malocco case, for example, I understand that he spent two years in Mountjoy Jail before being transferred to an open prison. However, a mere six months into a four-year sentence, Mr. Sheedy was transferred to Shelton Abbey. Why was this? Who sought it? Who arranged it?</P>
    <P>Then there is the happy coincidence that 12 days later, and after this monumental blunder by Judge Kelly, Judge Kelly is promoted to be a judge of the High Court on the recommendation of the Minister. Did the Minister make any attempt to check out his suitability or past performance? Was he aware of the circumstances surrounding this controversial case? The Minister is responsible for the courts. He is not responsible for judicial decisions, and nobody is asking him to trespass into the domain of judicial independence. He is, however, responsible for the administration and smooth functioning of the courts, and the buck stops at his feet for the maladministration which led to the listing and hearing of this case. He is the person who set down this standard by his insistence on such when in Opposition in the Judge Dominic Lynch affair. Once again, under the Minister's jurisdiction, there has been a major systems failure.</P>
    <P>Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. Considerable damage has been done to the credibility of the judicial system by the happenings in this affair. The judicial system must at all times be seen to be fair, independent and above reproach. Cases like these shatter people's confidence in the system. It feeds cynicism and the belief that there is one law for certain people and another for the rest. That is extremely serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on the details of this case in the five minutes available to me now. Those facts have been well rehearsed in this House and in the media in recent days. However, the catapulting of this case into such public prominence has brought additional trauma and grief upon the Ryan family who were the victims of the initial crime. It is the responsibility of all of us to expose the full truth of this matter as quickly as possible so as not to prolong that family's anguish.</P>
      <P>While more information has come into the public domain in the past 24 hours, thanks to the helpful intervention of the Tánaiste and the Attorney General in accepting my proposal yesterday that the judicial review file should be laid before this House, a number of very disturbing questions remain to be answered.</P>
      <P>The speed of the response from the Tánaiste when it was raised in the House yesterday and the day before was in marked contrast to that of the Minster for Justice and his Department. My colleague Deputy Rabbitte wrote to the Minister about this case on 15 February last. An acknowledgement issued on 17 February. No further correspondence has been received to date by him. A number of parliamentary questions were tabled on this matter since February, including one by me. In short, the Minister has had a considerable length of time to discover the truth of this matter and to put it into the public domain. In the circumstances that I have outlined, the response presented by the Minister of State to the Adjournment debate tabled by Deputy Jim Higgins and me on Tuesday were, at best, woefully inadequate and disrespectful of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have learned from the Minister's contribution that he received a phone call on 10 February from the Attorney General, while he was in Berlin. I imagine that it is a rather unusual occurrence for the Attorney General to ring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform abroad, concerning a court case. So, the alarm bells must surely have rung at that stage. When, as we have now learned, the contents of that phone call were that the Attorney General was alerting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; the man charged with ensuring the impartial administration of justice &ndash; that rumours were rife that improper practice, to use the Minister's words, might be involved, alarm bells should certainly have rung.</P>
      <P>In his response, the Minister tells us a member or members of the Judiciary will be required to comment on certain matters. He also tells us the result of his initial request to the Garda Commissioner was that there was nothing criminal to investigate at that stage. Presumably, the new information has required a further review of the need for a criminal investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that we are dealing with matters of a most serious kind. It is incumbent on the <Col N="313" /> Minister to bring full information to the House. It is wholly unacceptable that he would come to the House, having investigated this matter since 10 February, with what he describes as a preliminary statement, and that he is not in a position to make a definitive statement. How many weeks are required to conduct these investigations and inquiries?</P>
    <P>In recent days, spokespersons for the Minister have sought to suggest that the matter was not one for him to address, but rather a matter for the courts. In my contribution on Tuesday, I clearly stated that the Minister is responsible for the administration of court officers and is accountable to the House for the conduct of his departmental staff.</P>
    <P>The key questions to be addressed are how this case came to be relisted before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly without notice to the DPP and why prosecuting counsel was not present when the sentence was reviewed. That is not a difficult matter for the Minister to find out in the time he has had. We deserve, and ought to have, answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>It is unprecedented for an investigation of this kind to be conducted by the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court. That shows that it is fundamentally important. The comments of the Minister, guarded as they are, in this debate underscore the seriousness of the matter. The prime responsibility of any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to ensure full and complete confidence in the impartial administration of justice. His handling of this affair to date has clearly failed this critical test. He cannot side-step or off-load this critical responsibility.</P>

        <b>:</b> What are the normal procedures for listing a case for the Circuit Criminal Court, or for an appeal? The Minister has been <i>au fait</i> with this matter since 10 February. To date, has he established who gave the instruction to the county registrar to list this case to come before Judge Kelly on 12 November 1998?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The listing of cases is the business of the court. I am informed that in the Circuit Criminal Court the Chief State Solicitor would list all new trials. I am also informed that in relation to particular cases these are listed by the Circuit Criminal Court office on the understanding that the party making the application will notify the other parties involved. I am further informed that the Circuit Criminal Court office does not notify any of the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to who asked the county registrar to list the case concerned, I have seen documentation which states that it is a certain individual. That individual is clearly entitled to reply to those allegations. I want to make this much perfectly clear; while, as Minister for Justice, <Col N="314" /> Equality and Law Reform, I would not conceal anything I believe should be in the public domain, and while I would not abuse my office, I will not ever operate a kangaroo court. There will be fair play and procedure in this matter. To have otherwise would be to infringe on individuals' personal rights. Suffice it to say that whatever action is required at the end of all this, following upon a full and fair investigation, it will be taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Immediately upon learning of this matter I recognised its seriousness. Why else would I and the Attorney General have discussed the issue of the Chief Justice being informed? Why else would I have asked the Secretary General of my Department to contact the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána? Why else would I have initiated inquiries at official level in my Department?</P>
    <P>In regard to another red herring which has been thrown into this debate with a view to discrediting me, the issue of Shelton Abbey and this prisoner was not brought before me. It was an administrative decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that reply, is the Minister satisfied as a result of his long inquiries to date that the case was relisted in the usual way and that nothing irregular occurred in the listing procedure? If so, what explanation is there for the fact that the prosecution authorities claim in sworn affidavit that they were taken by surprise by its appearance in the list?</P>

In relation to the review of sentence option being set aside, we must accept the Minister's word that he had nothing to do with this. However, is he aware that when Judge Matthews asked Mr. Sheedy's senior counsel, Mr. Seán Moylan, if he was aware of the novelty of the application &ndash; that it was very rare for someone to come before the court and seek to set aside the right or option for a review in relation to the reduction of a sentence &ndash; Mr. Moylan said in court they would take their chances with executive clemency?</P>

      <P>Time is very short in this very serious debate. It is clear the report the Minister received yesterday from the Chief State Solicitor's office contains very serious matters. The Minister has informed the House that subsequent to receiving the report, he revisited the question of a Garda investigation. Has he decided to refer the contents of the Chief State Solicitor's report to the gardaí for criminal investigation? What was the outcome of the advice he sought, according to his speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to his responsibilities to this House, I am mindful of the Minister's comments on natural justice for individuals, but I am also aware of <Col N="317" /> his attitude when in Opposition. He is accountable to this House and must give full information as quickly as is proper. When will he be ready to give the result of the inquiries and the information he has? His actions to date have been lethargic, to put it at its kindest, in a matter of such great importance.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Domiciliary Care Allowance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I call on the Minister and the Government to make the domiciliary care allowance available to the parents of severely handicapped children under the age of two as a measure of social solidarity and a recognition of the intense stress suffered by these parents.</P>
      <P>The family of a disabled child which chooses to look after that child at home is entitled to a domiciliary care allowance. They are not, under present rules, entitled to claim it until the child reaches the age of two years. This is an inexplicable and cruel anomaly in the present system, and I ask the Minister to examine the situation and amend it. In the past, many of the babies who suffered from severe disabilities did not live to reach the age of two. Today, thanks to the advance of modern medicine, the mortality rate among such children has plummeted.</P>
      <P>When this flaw in the system first came to my attention I was utterly dismayed that the State could be so callous and insensitive. To discover one's newly born child suffers from a severe handicap is a source of unfathomable despair to a parent. These children may, for example, cry incessantly, be blind or mute. To exacerbate the situation by refusing to lend assistance to that family unit until the child is two, is a deplorable act. The level of stress suffered by parents when they discover this, is difficult to express and every assistance should be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Minister in reply to a question in the Dáil stated that at present the scheme does <Col N="322" /> not cover children under the age of two years since all children in that age group are regarded as requiring constant care and attention. There is no doubt a severely handicapped baby requires intensive care and attention which is much more than would be required by what we would describe as a normal child. The case for ensuring the domiciliary care allowance is paid for all babies must be made. The fact it is not paid is, I am sure, a remnant of past legislation; an archaic insensitivity which we must resolve. I implore the Minister to do justice to these suffering few. Let us alleviate the plight of those emotionally distraught by their alienation and ensure the anomaly is removed immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister fully understands and appreciates the Deputy's concern. He is very aware of the problems and the difficulties facing parents and carers of children with severe disabilities. Their unstinting commitment to care for these children must be and is acknowledged by the Minister. For many, this commitment is a life long dedication and is not only confined to the childhood years.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile however to explain the nature and background to the scheme. The domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>The scheme operates under section 61 of the 1970 Health Act. This section empowers a health board to make arrangements to assist in the maintenance, at home, of a sick or infirm person or a dependant of such a person or a person, who, but for the provision of a service for him under this section would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.</P>
      <P>The scheme applies to children aged between two and 16 years of age. Eligibility is subject to a means test but only the means of the child are taken into account. For example, a child who receives a payment of compensation resulting in an income in excess of the allowance does not qualify. The current rate of the allowance is £106.70 per month. In 1997 just over 8,800 allowances were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria under which the scheme operates state that the handicap must be present at the time of the application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date and be likely to continue to last for at least a year. The necessary medical assessment is carried out by health board medical personnel. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals because should a child's condition improve, he or she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility. These reviews also provide an opportunity to ensure that the services available and the care plan in place meet the needs of the <Col N="323" /> recipient on an ongoing basis to the extent possible.</P>
    <P>The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained in institutions. However, where a child is at home for a continuous period of more than two months, for example, summer holidays, the allowance may be granted for that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of the many requests made by concerned individuals and representative organisations urging that the scheme be extended to cover severely disabled children under two years of age. The guidelines state that &ldquo;children below the age of two are not regarded as eligible as such children normally require constant care and attention in any event&rdquo;, as was pointed out by the Deputy. However, there is a view that children under two years who have a severe disability need a much greater level of care than a healthy baby.</P>
    <P>However, we must recognise the demands made on parents and guardians in relation to the care required for disabled children of all ages. As the Deputy is aware, there are many demands on the scarce resources available to support the care of the ill and needy. Priorities have to be agreed between a number of Departments to target resources as effectively as possible towards supporting the fullest spectrum of carers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one recent initiative is the agreement that the carer's allowance, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is to be extended to include eligible carers of children currently in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance. This initiative will be introduced in August this year. Eligibility will be subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the life long commitment of carers through the childhood years into adulthood. In many cases the care needs and requirements are quite often the same between child and adult, and the same quality of care can arise in both cases. In addition, the same problems of income can arise in both cases. The extension of the carer's allowance means that eligible carers providing full-time care and attention to a child in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance will benefit from this additional income. The Deputy will appreciate that any decision to extend the domiciliary care allowance to children under two years of age and who are severely disabled will impact not only the scheme itself but on the provision of other assistance provided by the state in the sphere of care and income support. Issues such as means testing and appropriate medical criteria require also to be addressed in this context.</P>
    <P>As indicated in replies to recent parliamentary questions, the Minister, arranged for the issue of an extension of the domiciliary care allowance to be examined within the Department. This examination has involved consultation with the health boards, concerned groups and other Departments. The evidence gathered and initial outcome <Col N="324" /> of that examination leads me to being sympathetic towards the principle of extending coverage of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, however, for the reasons stated keeping matters under review in relation to the future possible extension of the domiciliary care allowance to children under two years of age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for being present. He has had a very busy 48 hours or more at Hillsborough and I thank him for the work he was doing there on our behalf. Given the type of work they do, traffic wardens were never the most popular group. However, since the introduction of wheel clamping, motorists are beginning to realise wardens were decent people. They are the salt of the earth but have been treated very badly by two State bodies. A Government decision of 26 July 1995 transferred the traffic warden service to Dublin Corporation's director of traffic. The transfer is due to take effect on 12 April 1999. The traffic wardens are deeply unhappy about the negotiations which have taken place to date and they cannot seem to obtain basic replies to simple questions. They surely have a right to this information and are entitled to answers.</P>
      <P>They merely want clarification on their future roles and they are entitled to this under the European Communities Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, 1980. How many permanent traffic wardens will Dublin Corporation require? Will they carry out full duties as currently prescribed for traffic wardens? How long will they be retained as traffic wardens? What alternative work might they be offered? How many redundancies will be required? What is the legal position regarding existing contracts which they have with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
      <P>It is a little daft to see the Department transferring employees to a local authority simply to make them redundant. The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment and Local Government must get actively involved to sort this matter out, otherwise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be obliged to reverse the decision of July 1995. His Department simply cannot abandon them and leave them to their own devices and allow Dublin Corporation to deal with the outstanding issue.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be sympathetic to their plight in his reply and endeavour to answer these basic questions and have their reservations clarified. Paragraph 7.1 of the European Communities Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, 1980, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transferor and transferee concerned in a transfer shall inform the representatives of <Col N="325" /> their respective employees affected by the transfer of</P>
    <P>(a) the reasons for the transfer</P>
    <P>(b) the legal, economic and social implications of the transfer for the employees, and</P>
    <P>(c) the measures envisaged in relation to the employees</P>
    <P>and the information shall be given by</P>
    <P>(i) the transferor to the representatives of his employees in good time before the transfer is carried out</P>
    <P>(ii) the transferee to the representatives of his employees in good time and in any event before his employees are directly affected by the transfer as regards their conditions of work and employment.</P>
    <P>Those provisions have been neglected on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Haughey for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position in regard to the transfer of the traffic warden service to Dublin Corporation. It is due to take place on 12 April 1999, and will give effect to a Government decision of 26 July 1995, which gives responsibility for traffic management in Dublin to Dublin Corporation. This was recommended to Government by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government as part of the Dublin transportation initiative plan.</P>
      <P>The plan recommended the appointment by Dublin Corporation of a director of traffic to be employed by Dublin Corporation, who would take over responsibility from the Garda for traffic wardens, on the spot fines and tow away services, introduce wheel clamping and have overall responsibility for traffic management in Dublin city. The progress on the implementation of the Government decision is as follows: the director of traffic was appointed by the corporation in April 1997, wheel clamping was introduced in the summer of 1998 and the corporation took over responsibility for the tow away service in September 1998.</P>
      <P>All 146 traffic wardens employed by the Garda Commissioner will be transferred to the corporation. They are State industrial employees and can, therefore, be transferred within the public sector. They will be transferred with the functions they discharge to a local authority such as Dublin Corporation. The transfer will bring the Dublin metropolitan area into line with the rest of the State whereby local authorities employ traffic wardens under the Local Government (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic wardens and representatives from their unions, IMPACT and SIPTU, have been aware of the transfer since negotiations under the PCW pay agreement commenced in mid-1996. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="326" /> Reform, the Garda Commissioner and Dublin Corporation have been involved in these negotiations and, as a result, joint proposals, which will enhance the traffic wardens' pay and conditions, were put to both unions last December. As recently as yesterday, my Department, together with representatives of the Commissioner, Department of Finance, Dublin Corporation, IMPACT and SIPTU, were engaged in prolonged and detailed discussions on the transfer and further discussions are planned to clarify arrangements and so on.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, concerns were expressed that some traffic wardens are to be made compulsorily redundant following the transfer to the corporation. I completely refute this suggestion. As part of the PCW proposals, Dublin Corporation is prepared to offer the traffic wardens on transfer a voluntary retirement package for those who wish to avail of it. The transfer of the traffic wardens service will complete the transfer of traffic services to Dublin Corporation, thus fully implementing the Government decision.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that in the ongoing discussions his views will be taken into account. I am well aware of his deep and abiding interest in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past I have welcomed various initiatives by the Minister for Education and Science, particularly the IT initiative which he launched almost two years ago when he took up office and his recent announcement on pupil-teacher ratios. However, the hype that sometimes emanates from his Department seems to be far from the reality on the ground. This is especially evident in regard to funding for second level schools throughout the country, and in my constituency in particular, under various capital programmes. All Members receive complaints about pupil-teacher ratios in second level schools.</P>
      <P>Pobalscoil Neasain and Grange community college are outstanding second level schools. Pobalscoil Neasain serves the parishes of Baldoyle, mid-Sutton and Sutton and it has a fine academic and extra-curricular record. Grange community college serves the parishes of Donaghmede, Airfield and Kilbarrack and has a similar outstanding record. They are located in two fine communities and I have had the pleasure of bringing classes from both schools into Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, both schools were built without adequate recreational facilities. Pobalscoil Neasain is located in Baldoyle, which is a polder, and the local park is below sea level for the majority of the year. As a result, the pupils have been at a serious disadvantage in terms of participating in sporting activity. In 1987 the Government of the day agreed to a new sports hall for the school. Following that year's general election, the new Government, including former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey and &ldquo;Mack the Knife&rdquo;, the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, took <Col N="327" /> up office and gutted this project and it disappeared into history.</P>
    <P>Between 1992 and 1996 I took up the battle again on behalf of the school and after much campaigning, the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, agreed to sanction a sports hall and get it back on track. There were meetings about the required facilities and so on. When Deputy Martin took up office I expected him to ask my constituency colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, to dig the sod and get the process under way. I was astonished to learn, in response to a parliamentary question a few weeks ago, that the project has not yet reached tender stage. I had thought it was at the point of being launched, but nothing has happened in the past two years. The Minister said he would proceed with it as resources permit. During the 1997 election his party was committed to that project, as my party has been, because the sports hall is a much needed facility which should have been built by now.</P>
    <P>A similar long campaign has been waged for Grange community college, Donaghmede. I thought the project had been approved and was progressing well, although there is disappointment that the facility will not be large enough for basketball or indoor football. As with Pobalscoil Neasáin, the response I received in respect of Grange community college is disappointing as it appears the project is being put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to be true to the promises made in 1997. My colleague, the former Minister, Ms Bhreathnach, did much of the fundamental work to resurrect these projects and put them in train. It is time the Government lived up to its commitments. There has been a long campaign to curb antisocial behaviour by young people on the northside of Dublin. The projects for these schools are urgently needed and would do a great deal to provide recreational facilities. I urge the Minister to get them under way and I would like to be present at the sod turning ceremony by either of the Ministers, Deputy Woods or Deputy Martin, in the coming weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter. The Minister is grateful for this opportunity to clarify the position concerning Pobalscoil Neasáin and Grange community college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, I will give details of the background to the schools. When they were built, between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s, the schedule of <Col N="328" /> accommodation to be provided did not include physical education halls but it was intended that they would be constructed at a later date. Unfortunately, due to demands on limited capital resources at the time, priority was given to the provision of classroom accommodation.</P>
    <P>However, as the Deputy may be aware, funding for the post-primary capital building programme has improved considerably in the past two years. The Minister is pleased that the provision for post primary school building projects in this year's Estimates is almost £60 million, compared with £30 million, which was the allocation at the beginning of 1997. This increased provision will enable the Department to proceed with a significantly increased number of building projects.</P>
    <P>Regarding the specific details of these projects, I will deal first with Pobalscoil Neasáin. The Department undertook the refurbishment of science laboratories in 1996 following a fire at the school, at a cost in the region of £120,000. The architectural planning of a PE hall for this school was included in the 1995 capital programme. A design team has been appointed and this project has commenced architectural planning. The planning and building unit of the Department is addressing issues relating to the location of the PE hall on the site and is in contact with Fingal County Council regarding issues which may arise when an application for planning permission is lodged.</P>
    <P>In the case of Grange community college, provision was also made in the 1995 capital programme for the architectural planning for a PE hall at the school. The Department is in regular contact with County Dublin VEC and its design team in relation to progressing this project and the Minister is pleased to inform the Deputy that, arising from a recent meeting with the chief executive officer of County Dublin VEC, the consultant architect and officials from the building unit of the Department, it has been agreed to increase the size of the PE hall to be provided at the school to the largest size provided at post primary schools. The chief executive officer is satisfied the Department is showing commitment to Grange community college by this increase. The design team will shortly provide a programme outlining the timescale for the architectural design.</P>
    <P>The Minister assures the Deputy that the Department is working to ensure physical education facilities will be put in place in both schools at the earliest possible date. He is committed to providing the best quality facilities for pupils and teachers in all schools.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 April 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21, 32, 36, 38, 45, 50, 52, 66, 69, 72, 119, 130, 135 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process has been set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. The reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service must be seen in the broader context of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces generally. The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan made specific provision for the special studies of the Air Corps and the Naval Service on the basis that the initial Price Waterhouse review had necessarily concentrated on the Army. Price Waterhouse's 1998 report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service sets out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations can be proceeded with fairly quickly while others will take longer. As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and those of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>It is important that implementation of the recommendations is undertaken in a planned way having regard to the development of the Defence Forces as a whole. This is why I have asked the Chief of Staff in conjunction with the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked the chief of staff for proposals to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State. These proposals would form the basis of the longer term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service to complement the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency measures. I understand that a considerable amount of work has been done and I expect to receive draft proposals for my consideration in the near future. These proposals will include, <i>inter alia</i>, organisation, personnel, infrastructure and options in relation to future equipment for both services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also emphasised the importance of involving all the relevant stakeholders in the process. Accordingly, I have established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the <Col N="332" /> input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State air and sea services. This consultation group, which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Thus far, the group has held one meeting at which I invited the stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this. The group will meet again as the planning and implementation process develops.</P>
    <P>In addition, arrangements are being put in place to ensure the Defence Forces Representative Associations are kept informed of developments. The details of these arrangements are currently under discussion with the associations.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-1998, which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the reserve to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997, I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the Chief of Staff had already established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. In addition, a considerable amount of work had already been undertaken by earlier military boards which were set up to seek the views of the membership on the future organisation and structure of the reserve.</P>
      <P>The joint civilian-military steering group, as part of its work, oversees and guides the military board in its task. The membership of the steering group comprises an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from my Department and a serving officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil. No member of the steering group is a member of the military board.</P>
      <P>From the outset there has been ongoing liaison and exchange of views between the steering group and the military board and meetings of the steering group are attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who keep the group well briefed on the board's progress. The steering group also advises the military board regarding aspects of the reserve that should be examined or looked at in greater depth by the military board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The military board submitted an interim report early in 1998 and the steering group submitted an interim report to me in July 1998. In December 1998, the military board forwarded an initial draft of its final report to the steering group for con<Col N="333" /> sideration. The steering group, having examined the report conveyed its views and recommendations to the military board. The military board, having had regard to those views and recommendations is at present preparing the final draft of its report. The steering group will then examine the findings and recommendations of the board and on conclusion of its deliberations will submit a final report to me setting out its findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and it met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association which also made presentations to the group.</P>
    <P>As the military board study is nearing completion it is anticipated that the board will be in a position to submit its final report shortly. The steering group, which will have regard to the military board report, will submit its final report to me as soon as possible thereafter and I will publish the report in due course.</P>

      <P>Personal injury cases are taken on the basis that negligence is alleged against the defendants. With reference to post-traumatic stress disorder, the Defence Forces have for some time operated a stress management and PTSD programme, the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to provide support to personnel so that they can deal with trauma and stressful situations in an appropriate and timely manner. This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, each claim is dealt with on its own particular merits in the light of legal advice received. There are now 18 cases outstanding.</P>

The number of personnel in each brigade, the Air Corps, Naval Service and Defence Force training centre are shown in the tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Approximately 400 personnel who enlisted for five year service engagements in 1994 are currently under review with regard to extending their service. To date, 12 such personnel who applied for extension of service have not been approved having been found not to meet the criteria for extension in service because they do not meet the conduct or fitness criteria. The military authorities advise that all applications for extension of service are likely to be processed by mid-April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 26, 70, 90, 114, 117 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to prepare proposals for Government for a compensation scheme for serving and former personnel of the Defence Forces who may have suffered a hearing disability arising from their service. The scheme will be based on the Green Book which has been accepted by the courts as a fair and reasonable system of assessing disability and which has been underpinned by the Oireachtas in the Civil Liability (Assessment of Injury) Act, 1998. It is, accordingly, the key factor in assessing the level of disability in individual claims.</P>
      <P>In setting the proposed level of compensation I will be mindful, first, of striking an equitable balance between the rights of claimants with genuine injuries and what can be afforded by the taxpayer. Second, I must also have regard to the quantum of damages awarded by the courts in these cases.</P>
      <P>In this latter connection, it is well known that I have reservations about the tariff established last year in the second test case, Hanley. Although the Green Book was generally accepted as the basis for the assessment of hearing injury in that case, an additional dimension was added to take account of future hearing loss. This, combined with the tariff, greatly increases the damages indicated in the first test case, Greene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response, my Department has been consulting with experts in the fields of medicine and statistics regarding the modified assessment methodology developed in Hanley. As Deputies are aware, the Supreme Court is not a court of first instance and will, on appeal, deal only with arguments which were first made in the High Court. My difficulty with the prognostic factor introduced in Hanley revolves around the increasing unreliability of any statistical methodology the further into the future it is required to predict. In the case of a 30 year old with a present zero disability, the Hanley prognostication formula could permit an award of up to £9,000 in damages. Furthermore, if the same individual had a 35 per cent hearing disability he would, under the Hanley tariff, receive what I had understood a person with total deafness would otherwise have generally received from the courts. In these circumstances, I have been taking advice on whether it would be preferable to address these issues in a third case in the High Court or to proceed to <Col N="337" /> seek an early hearing of the Hanley appeal on the basis that sufficient evidence is available in that case to make these arguments in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Green Book's status as a fair assessment system and assuming a reasonable and affordable tariff emerges from the courts, I do not see the necessity for a tribunal with attendant delay and representation costs, rather, I intend to establish a compensation scheme which will provide for the speedy resolution of claims by reference to established and accepted criteria of assessment and compensation.</P>
    <P>With regard to future claims, it is impossible to say how many claims will eventually materialise. I have noted that recently there has been a decline in the number arriving each week. The level of new claims is now averaging at about 100 per month. It is estimated that up to 150,000 personnel served in the Defence Forces prior to 1987, the date which is generally accepted as being the date on which a safe system of hearing protection was in place for military personnel. It is thought, however, that claims for the more serious injuries have already been made as newer claims tend to show a lower level of hearing disability.</P>

      <P>By 19 March last, the total cost of awards, settlements and costs paid by my Department in Army hearing loss claims was almost £71 million; £2.6 million has been paid in respect of 154 court awards, while out of court settlements in 2,698 cases have cost £53 million. Legal fees paid to firms of solicitors amount to £15.3 million to date.</P>

      <Col N="338" /> Administration costs are currently estimated at approximately £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £850,000 per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces, and almost £800,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitor's Office. A total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, approximately £2.4 million per year.</P>
    <P>The monthly rate of claims received this year has been 100 claims in January, 99 claims in February and 48 claims up to 19 March, a total of 247 claims.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty brings within the remit of the Common Foreign and Security Policy the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping and crisis management. The treaty provides that it will be for the Western European Union to carry out such tasks, at the instigation of the EU. Ireland will be entitled to participate in such tasks and has indicated its willingness to do so on a case by case basis. Ireland considers it important that the EU should seek to ensure the effective functioning of these new provisions on peace-keeping and crisis management when the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force.</P>
      <P>Any involvement by the Defence Forces in Petersberg Tasks under the auspices of the Amsterdam Treaty would most likely be in the areas of peace-keeping and humanitarian tasks on a voluntary and case by case basis. It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations with which they are tasked from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 40, 118 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>In common with all tender competitions organised by my Department, the competition for the procurement of Armoured Personnel Carriers was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures whose objective is the achievement of the highest standards of impartiality, objectivity and transparency. Tenderers were afforded equal opportunity in their submissions and in providing such further information as was necessary to ensure that their proposals were fully presented to the Department.</P>
      <P>More than 30 prospective suppliers worldwide had expressed interest in the APC procurement programme and proposals were received from 12 companies. The proposals were evaluated and assessed by a civilian-military project team which was established to manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.</P>
      <P>Two vehicles were selected to go forward to the final stage of the tender competition having complied fully with the initial technical specification. The vehicles proposed by the other ten firms failed to comply with one or more of a range of essential elements of the specification and the firms were notified accordingly. I am satisfied that the assessment of compliance with the technical requirements of the specification was carried out by the project team in a professional and objective manner.</P>
      <P>The successful proposals were submitted by Mowag of Switzerland who manufacture the Piranha APC and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria who manufacture the Pandur APC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February last these two suppliers were asked to prepare formal tenders on the basis of a more detailed specification. Completed tenders were received in my Department on 19 March and they are being evaluated to determine technical merit and the best economic advantage to the Department. The evaluation process will include trials in <Col N="340" /> Ireland of both vehicles by the Defence Forces. The trials will commence shortly and will continue for about two months. The aim of the trials is to assess from a technical and user perspective the suitability of the vehicles.</P>
    <P>I expect that a contract will be in place later this year for the supply of up to 40 APCs over five years and the first APCs should be delivered next year.</P>
    <P>The purchase of modern APCs is regarded by the Defence Forces as the most urgent equipment requirement to enable them carry out all of the roles assigned by Government. One of the priorities in An Action Programme for the Millennium is to &ldquo;equip the Defence Forces adequately for an expanded role in international peacekeeping&rdquo;. The procurement of APCs forms an integral part of an ongoing re-equipment programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote in updating Naval Service equipment. Total amounts spent on such equipment for the past four years are as follows: 1995, £4.3 million; 1996, £4.1 million; 1997, £10.1 million; and £15.5 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately £22.5 million will be spent on Naval Service equipment this year.</P>
      <P>The more important developments in relation to the improvement of Naval Service equipment include the placing of a contract for a new fishery protection patrol vessel and the refit of five of the existing seven Naval Service vessels. The new vessel is due for delivery later this year and will cost approximately £22.5 million.</P>
      <P>Refits involve replacing and-or refurbishing obsolete or deteriorated equipment and are necessary to extend the operational life of a vessel. Earlier this year a half-life refit of <i>LE Eithne</i> was completed in the naval dockyard, Haulbowline, at an estimated cost of £2.06 million. In previous years four other vessels &ndash;<i>LE Emer</i>, <i>LE Deirdre</i>, <i>LE Aoife</i> and <i>LE Aisling</i>&ndash; have been similarly refitted.</P>
      <P>The two remaining vessels &ndash;<i>LE Orla</i> and <i>LE Ciara</i>&ndash; will undergo similar refurbishment over the next two years, with work starting on <i>LE Orla</i> later this year.</P>
      <P>These refits have been facilitated on a part-cost recoupment basis under the European Union Fishery Protection Programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 a total of 74 recruits, three radio radar technicians, four apprentices, nine watchkeeping <Col N="341" /> officers and 12 cadets were enlisted in the Naval Service. Sixty five recruits will be enlisted in the service in the near future. Seventeen apprentices will be recruited shortly and a competition for 14 cadetships will be advertised in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a fair share of available resources has been allocated to the Naval Service to enable it to discharge effectively the tasks assigned to the service. I will continue to keep the matter under review in the context of the implementation of the Price Waterhouse report on the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Public Enterprise has prime responsibility for emergency planning for nuclear accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a significant role in the preparation and exercise of emergency plans for nuclear accidents particularly in the years subsequent to the catastrophic destruction of a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl in 1985. As I indicated to the House on 25 February, my Depart<Col N="342" /> ment has played its full part in such planning which is carried out under the auspices of my colleague in the Department of Public Enterprise. The Government approved a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents and this was published in booklet form in 1992 by the Department of Energy. The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure. This culminated late last year in Government approval of a revised and approved format for such emergency management.</P>
    <P>My Department ensures that the planning and preparations are in place to provide an effective response. Arrangements with local authorities to have an effective civil defence organisation available to undertake the various duties assigned under the emergency plan are ongoing. Civil Defence personnel are trained, equipped and exercised to monitor radiation levels and to collect samples of soil, vegetation etc. Arrangements are in place for Army personnel to monitor radiation levels at pre-determined and other locations.</P>
    <P>In times of crisis my Department will provide such services as may be required from the Permanent Defence Force and civil defence to assist with the implementation of counter measures. Liaison will be maintained with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Emergency Co-ordinating Committee at the Department of Public Enterprise to ensure provision of the appropriate support.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 34 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps. From the outset the scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who are currently rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps. The scheme, the conditions of which were not changed as suggested by the Deputy, was introduced with a view to retaining senior pilots who occupy key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. The gratuities are designed to strike a balance between the demand of the commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining qualified personnel.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the incentive scheme has helped to stabilise the drain of pilots from the Air Corps. A total of 14 pilots have opted to participate in the service commitment scheme and it is likely that a number of pilots who will become eligible for participation in the scheme later this year will also opt to participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 41, 62, 109 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The question of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was the subject of a Private Members' motion and debate on 28 January 1999 in this House culminating in the passing by the House of a Government resolution undertaking favourably to examine further Ireland's participation in PfP taking into account the ongoing public debate. I dealt extensively with this matter when I replied to questions in the House on 25 February 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a reply to a question on 30 March <Col N="346" /> 1999, reiterated the point that any decision by the Government in favour of Ireland's participation in PfP would be submitted to the House for its approval and would make clear the nature and scope of such participation.</P>
    <P>As regards implications for the Defence Forces of a decision to participate in PfP, as I have indicated previously to the House, I would envisage that any possible future role for the Defence Forces would be in the area of peacekeeping, humanitarian and rescue tasks. Participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP.  In addition, individual states decide on the scope and extent of their participation in PfP activities and in this regard agree individual partnership programmes covering the activities to which they wish to subscribe. In Ireland's case, should we decide to participate in PfP, it is envisaged that selected activities would, as I have said, include peacekeeping under a UN mandate, humanitarian and rescue tasks. These are activities in line with our traditional involvement and experience in these areas.</P>
    <P>Since there has been no decision to participate in PfP, and in view of the nature of any envisaged participation by the Defence Forces, the question of implications for resources and procedures for the Defence Forces does not arise at this juncture. Having said that, it is the policy of the Government to ensure the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations with which they are tasked from time to time.</P>

    <P>In addition, the cost of private security at Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy is £43,126.82. I should point out that there would also be additional costs in providing military security parties at the vacated barracks. Apart from normal pay and allowances, these costs include security duty allowances as well as transport and subsistence. On security duty allowances alone, the military authorities have estimated that savings to date amount to about £200,000. It must also be borne in mind that one of the main reasons for closing barracks was to relieve the Defence Forces of the burden of guarding too many barracks and posts, and thereby to release personnel for operational duties.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the House on 30 March 1999, the only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Interim Force in Cyprus. Troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of US $1087.10 per person per month.</P>
      <P>On 31 March 1999 the total amount owing to my Department by the United Nations in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions was calculated at IR£8.4 million approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuous efforts are made by this country to recover  moneys owed from the United Nations. These efforts are strenuously pursued with the United Nations on an ongoing basis by this <Col N="348" /> Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. Both my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I take every opportunity to raise with the UN Ireland's concerns regarding arrears. During the recent visit of the UN Secretary General to Ireland the opportunity was taken to raise Ireland's concern about arrears owing in respect of our participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Over the six months to 26 March, the UN repaid arrears of £4.5 million, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 54, 61, 71, 120 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>This will be the first ever White Paper on Defence. It will provide a framework for the evolution of national defence policy and the continuing reorganisation process in the Defence Forces. Overall, the White Paper presents a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>A range of foundation work is now under way which will form the basis of the future planning elements of the White Paper. These foundation elements relate to an assessment of the defence and security environment, an examination of the progress already made in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan and, of course, the consultative process.</P>
      <P>To date, this consultative process has involved the receipt of 45 written submissions from a wide range of individuals, groups and organisations.  Submissions from PDFORRA and the Department of Finance were received in January.  Last week I received RACO's submission and a small number of others are expected in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that these submissions contain a wide range of views. I have made it clear that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any one individual submission received by my Department as part of the consultative process. It is important to respect the right of all individuals <Col N="350" /> and organisations to have their submissions fairly treated.</P>
    <P>Meetings may be arranged with some of the authors of other submissions where this might be useful. In addition, full consultations will take place with the Defence Force Representative Associations in accordance with the normal system of representation.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise at this point the importance that I am placing on having a real and meaningful consultation process.  It would be remiss of me not to ensure that a topic of fundamental importance is properly addressed. However, I must add that I am conscious of the need for balance to be maintained between consultation, on the one hand, and my duty as Minister in relation to the formation of defence policy, on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally.</P>
      <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the immediate sale of the barracks. Sixty per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment. The balance will be used both to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures take place. Two of the barrack properties, Castleblayney and Fermoy, have already been offered for sale and a decision in relation to the offers received will be made shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> In relation to Devoy Barracks, Naas, a broad measure of agreement has been reached between the Department and Naas Urban District Council. The fine details are being dealt with and it is hoped to have an agreement concluded in the near future. A process of rezoning is required before the property can be offered for sale on the open market. It is anticipated that this process will take a number of months. As regards Magee Barracks, Kildare, I expect to meet with representatives of the county council in the near future to discuss the property in question. The sale of both barracks will take place as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ballincollig, the largest of the properties concerned, tenders have been received from independent planning consultants for the preparation of an integrated action area plan for the future development of the property. An integral part of that plan will be to undertake a comprehensive public consultation process with all relevant community interests in the Ballincollig area. It is intended to appoint consultants in the near future. Following consideration and adoption of the integrated action area plan the property will be offered for sale on the open market.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to evacuate Clancy Barracks in the short term, but it will be disposed of following the transfer of the storage facilities which are located there to the Curragh Camp.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to tanks at the Naval Base, Haulbowline, which are used for the storage of fuel and lubrication oils for naval vessels. The question of rationalising and upgrading the facilities to meet current and future requirements has been under consideration. To assist the corps of engineers in assessing the condition of the installations and in formulating proposals for a works project the services of Jacobs Engineering Ltd. were retained for the provision of special technical surveys and recommendations. Consideration of the matter by my Department, taking into account the consultants' report, is continuing with a view to designing an appropriate programme of works to upgrade the oil storage facilities, including provision of new tanks where necessary and associated pipework. Provision has been made in the building and engineering subhead of the Defence Estimates for this year to enable a contract to be placed and commenced. <Col N="352" /> It is anticipated that the cost of the project will be in the region of £1.2 million.</P>

As a bulk of military operations are conducted there, in particular basic flying training flights, the base could not be considered suitable for use by commercial airlines with scheduled services. In the circumstances, the question of the deployment of military personnel to assist in the operation of commercial ventures at Baldonnel has not arisen.</P>
      <P>I might add that any proposals for the greater use of Baldonnel for the provision of a non military aviation service are appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <P>It has always been recognised that military personnel <Col N="354" /> may be exposed to traumatic situations leading to what has in the past been described as &ldquo;battle stress disorder&rdquo;. Indeed, one of the aims of military training is to create a sense of comradeship and mutual support to enable personnel to cope with the stress which is an inevitable part of military operations from time to time. Support from commanders, from the medical corps and from the chaplaincy service have always been available when required. In more recent times, following developments in the medical sciences which have led to the identification of what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder, procedures have been put in place which formalise these traditional support systems throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces now operate a stress management and post-traumatic stress disorder programme, the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to provide support to personnel so that they can deal with trauma and stressful situations in an appropriate and timely manner. This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>
      <P>Cases of post traumatic stress disorder are referred in the first instance to the military psychiatrist at St. Bricin's military hospital. A multidisciplinary approach to case management is generally adopted and is led by the psychiatrist. The team may include nurses of the Army nursing service with training in counselling skills, social workers of the personnel support service, the chaplaincy service and appropriate colleagues. The psychiatrist may also refer cases to civilian agencies, particularly clinical psychologists, if he feels that is appropriate.</P>

      <P>There were 28 apprentices at the Army Apprentice School in Devoy Barracks prior to the closure of that barracks. Of these, 18 attended the Dublin Institute of Technology, either at Bolton Street or at Kevin Street, for the purpose of completing their final &ldquo;off job&rdquo; training module, which module consisted of ten weeks. These 18 apprentices are variously training as fitters, carpenters and electricians. They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January and completed it recently.</P>
      <P>The remaining ten apprentices, who are training in electronics/communications, have relocated to the school of signals on the Curragh. Their training will be continuing into the middle of the year 2001.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, in future, Army apprentices will attend at FÁS and/or regional technical college courses for their formal &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training. This is already the long established situation with Naval Service apprentices. The apprenticeship needs of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are kept under regular review. Apprentices will continue to be recruited for specific trades and crafts, as and when required, in response to identified service needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 89, 126 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the inquiries referred to by the Deputies are those relating to the accident at Dublin Port during the Tall Ships Race in August 1998, the accident at Kilworth Camp and the incident in the Glen of Imaal, both of which occurred in December 1997.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 102 on 25 February last, following the accident at Dublin Port during the Tall Ships Race, the Naval Service instigated an investigation which is still ongoing. As this is essentially an aviation accident, an investigation is also being undertaken by the Department of Public Enterprise. The Naval Service is not in a position to finalise its investigation until the outcome of the investigation being carried out by the Department of Public Enterprise is known. The final report of that investigation is still awaited. Pending the outcome of the investigations, no further exercises of this nature will be undertaken by members of either the Naval Service or the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 62 and 76 on 25 February last, a court of inquiry was <Col N="358" /> initiated immediately following the accident at Kilworth firing range and its report was subsequently submitted to higher military authority.  The inquiry encompassed the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry. I am advised by the military authorities that the report as submitted gave rise to additional queries which could only be addressed by the re-convening of the court of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The court reconvened on 27 March and plans to do so again today and, if necessary, over the Easter period when it is hoped that its deliberation will be finalised. As I have indicated in my earlier reply, the outcome of the inquiry will determine if any action needs to be taken in the interests of safety.  The Deputies will appreciate that courts of inquiry of this nature are intensive and wide ranging and can take some considerable time to bring to completion.</P>
    <P>Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar is continuing but live firing for training purposes has, however, ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations.</P>
    <P>On 9 December 1997 during the course of a shoot in the Glen of Imaal involving two mortars, a misfire occurred on the firing of the sixth high explosive mortar bomb. Misfire drills were successfully carried out. As a precautionary measure, the weapons were inspected after the firing of each of the next ten rounds. As nothing unusual was reported it was decided to resume the shoot and from then on to inspect the weapons after the firing of the fifth round from each one. Another misfire occurred on the firing of the twenty fourth mortar bomb. The misfire drills were carried out but the bomb remained in the barrel. Because of declining light the ordnance officer decided to remove the bomb from the barrel the next morning and this was successfully done. Misfires are not uncommon and are provided for in the mortar training syllabus. The second misfire in this case was somewhat unusual only in that the bomb was not successfully removed from the barrel during the initial misfire drill. An ordnance officer was on site to deal with any matters arising.</P>
    <P>Both the incident in the Glen of Imaal and that which occurred at Kilworth firing range, County Cork, occurred on the same date, namely 9 December 1997. The weapon type was the same in each case. The mortar bombs were the same type and lot number in each case. It should be noted that between 1 October 1997 and 8 December 1997, 416 mortar bombs of this lot number were fired and only one misfire was reported. As I stated earlier, a court of inquiry was established into the accident at Kilworth. The only investigation into the incident in the Glen of Imaal would have been carried out on the spot by qualified personnel to determine why the weapon misfired. There is no ongoing investigation into this misfire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during the exercises in Kilworth and the Glen of Imaal. These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing. They include safety precautions and misfire drills.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of ongoing continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces has resulted in a significant increase in the number of volunteers for overseas service.  There were no problems with the numbers of volunteers for the 84th Infantry Battalion which is currently serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &ndash;  UNIFIL &ndash;  and none is expected in relation to the 85th Infantry Battalion due to depart later this month. I am, therefore, happy to say that the position in relation to personnel volunteering for overseas service is satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to provide a greater focus on military effectiveness and efficiency the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, which was approved by Government in March 1996, proposed the reorganisation of the top level military structure. Legislative change was required to give effect to these proposals which had the full support of the military authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1998, which came into effect on 1 October 1998, amended the Defence Act, 1954 to prescribe these changes. The appointments of adjutant-general and quartermaster-general have been replaced by two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) and Deputy Chief of Staff (Support). A new Defence Forces headquarters has been put in place. As a result there is now only one military element-branch in the Department, instead of the former three military branches, the head of which is the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff now manages the full range of <Col N="360" /> the military business of the Department and he is the sole military officer reporting directly to myself on military matters. The Chief of Staff has, with my approval, delegated duties to the deputy Chiefs of Staff.</P>
    <P>In amending the Defence Act the opportunity was also availed of to amend an additional section of the Act. Heretofore, the number of personnel assigned to each staff, unit or other element of the Defence Forces together with the rank and title or designation of each and every person serving in the forces was prescribed individually, in laborious detail, in regulations. The military authorities could not create a new appointment, suppress an appointment or otherwise increase or decrease the strength of a staff, unit or other element or change the title or designation of any military appointment without referring the matter to myself for approval and for the formal amendment of the relevant Defence Force regulations. The effect of the change is to put an end to this superfluous layer of regulatory detail.</P>
    <P>As a result of the amendment to the Act, Defence Force regulations simply prescribe the numerical establishment of the Defence Forces and the number in each rank, the maximum number of officers that may be paid professional pay as well as the maximum number of technicians and instructors in enlisted ranks. This gives the military authorities greater flexibility in enabling them to determine from time to time the strength of the various staffs, units and other elements of the forces and the title or designation of each military appointment within the prescribed overall strength of 11,500. It also facilitates the transfer or posting of personnel from time to time to areas of greatest need having regard to the operational requirements of the forces and to the exigencies of the service.</P>

      <P>I met with PDFORRA and RACO on two occasions each last year, once to discuss general issues and once to advise them of the Government's decision in relation to the closure of barracks and I also attended the annual delegate conferences of both associations.

      <P>In this regard the conciliation and arbitration scheme is the mechanism within which issues of concern to both the associations and the departmental side can and should be addressed. A number of meetings with the associations have been held under the C &amp; A mechanism this year and there are regular informal contacts between the official and staff sides.</P>

      <P>As I advised the house recently, a number of meetings have taken place between my Department and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, with a view to using St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step-down medical facility into which certain categories of <Col N="363" /> civilian patients could be transferred. Agreement in principle was reached on the introduction of a pilot scheme under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If the pilot scheme is successful it is intended that a long-term arrangement involving up to 20 civilian patients at a time will be put in place.</P>
      <P>As the overall responsibility for the health and wellbeing of civilian patients lies with the Department of Health and Children, it is essential that, to discharge its duties and responsibilities, that Department be fully satisfied regarding the arrangements pertaining to the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients while in St. Bricin's Hospital. The Department of Health and Children has advised the Mater Hospital of its requirements in this regard, and it is understood the matter is currently being pursued by the Mater Hospital authorities. A number of legal and insurance issues must also be resolved before the pilot scheme commences.</P>
      <P>During a site visit to St. Bricin's Hospital by a Mater Hospital delegation in May 1998, the need for an oxygen point to be installed beside each bed was identified.  Oxygen lines were subsequently installed, at a cost of £8,437.50. This is the sole cost to have been incurred specifically because of the Mater Hospital project.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Accommodation requirements at Casement Aerodrome are the subject of ongoing review, particularly in the light of the need to cater for personnel in the Air Corps Headquarters and at Gormanston who are due to be relocated to the Aerodrome. Contracts amounting to £3.4 million have been completed at Casement Aerodrome since 1996. These included accommodation and mess improvements for officers; new ministerial <Col N="364" /> air transport services (MATS) building; new engineering wing offices; new flight training school; up-grading of hangars; and renovation of the gymnasium.</P>
    <P>Projects with an estimated cost of £1.6 million are currently in progress. These include further hangar refurbishment; up-grading of the refuelling installation; installing two anemometers; re-roofing an engineer stores and a new Garda Air Support Unit Building which is shared by the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>Projects with an estimated final cost of more than £5 million are due to begin in 1999. These include a new hangar; re-roofing of hangar No. 4 and the engineer stores; and a new transport workshops. In addition various minor works will be undertaken to improve office and workshop facilities, locker rooms, toilets and showers.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the ongoing development of Casement Aerodrome and where the upgrading of facilities or provision of new premises is found to be necessary appropriate action will be taken to have the work carried out as quickly as possible in the light of competing demands and financial resources available.</P>

      <P>The military board which was established to identify military artefacts has been working on tabulating the current Defence Forces holdings of such and this work is at an advanced stage. These items include weapons from small arms to artillery pieces, armoured vehicles, transport vehicles, uniforms, militaria and monuments. Items of this material will be available for display in the proposed military museum section of the National Museum complex at Collins Barracks, as appropriate. The sourcing of further military artefacts for the military section of the National Museum will require some more detailed research and contact with foreign military institutions. Already, firm offers of support and material have been received from several military museums abroad which have material relating to Irish soldiers. It is envisaged that these items will provide the focus for the proposed &ldquo;History of Irish Soldiers in Foreign Armies&rdquo; section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>There is currently a total of 748 military personnel serving overseas of which 711 are serving with UN missions. Late last year I agreed to the secondment of 27 personnel to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, to assist in the relief effort in Honduras following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. They are currently working in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to requests for personnel for overseas missions is that any such requests are considered on the merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System (UNSAS). This system is intended to enhance the United Nations capacity for rapid response to emergency situations. It has been decided that the Defence Forces will participate in this system. <Col N="366" /> Such participation does not entail the commitment of additional personnel for UN service over and above a figure of 850 military personnel. There is, however, no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. Our decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations. Such peacekeeping operations invariably facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in the troubled areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of emergency response to UN requests, there is at present an initiative sponsored by Denmark known as SHIRBRIG. This envisages the establishment of a high readiness multi-national brigade, composed of contributions to the UNSAS with the aim of deploying troops at short notice to troubled spots around the world. Ireland has been keeping a watching brief on this initiative. The question of participation by Ireland in SHIRBRIG will be considered in the light of the legal and practical implications which the concept would raise for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service in this country.  The Air Corps provides a search and rescue service from Finner, County Donegal and Waterford Regional Airport as part of the overall search and rescue arrangements. Bond Helicopters provide a search and rescue service, using medium lift helicopters, from Shannon and Dublin Airports under contract to IMES.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service operating from Dublin Airport commenced on 1 July 1998, prior to which the Air Corps provided search and rescue coverage on the east coast. It had been intended that the new service would be crewed by Air Corps personnel <Col N="370" /> and would operate from Casement Aerodrome once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase had been resolved. This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority. The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years meant that the Air Corps was not in a position to provide pilots for the new service. Provision was, however, made in the contract with the operator for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date. The new service is currently operating from Dublin Airport with the option of relocating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process has been set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. I have asked the chief of staff in conjunction with the GOC of the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked for a submission from the Chief of Staff to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State which would form the basis of the longer term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service and which will be supported by the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency measures. I understand that a considerable amount of work has been done and I would expect to receive draft proposals for my consideration in the near future. These proposals will include,<i> inter alia</i>, organisation personnel, infrastructure and options in relation to future equipment for both services.</P>

      <P>The selling of fruit, or indeed any product, by the roadside is governed by the provisions of the Casual Trading Act, 1995. This Act has as its main purpose the delegation of all functions regarding casual trading to local authorities. Local authorities have a duty to make by-laws governing casual trading in their functional areas. They also have powers under the Act to exempt categories of selling from the Act.</P>
      <P>I am aware of and sympathise with the concerns of strawberry growers in Ireland, who have requested successive Ministers in recent years and who, in 1998, also requested me to grant an exemption under the casual trading legislation for the sale of strawberries. Careful examination of the matter led me to the same conclusion as my predecessors that exemptions from the Casual Trading Act, 1995, in this regard should be a matter for the local authorities to decide and not something with which central Government should become involved. The principal reason for such decisions is that the 1995 legislation which devolves such powers to local government, mainly at the request of local authorities, should be exercised in this case at that level, that is by the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, I feel it would not be appropriate for me to meet with the Wexford fruit growers about this issue and I suggest that they raise the matter with the relevant local authorities.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the community employment programme is to equip long-term unemployed and socially excluded persons with experience and workplace skills to enable them to take up a job in the open labour market. Community employment has operated at a level of around 40,000 participants for the past several years. The appropriateness of maintaining participation at this level, at a time of increasing tightening in the labour market, has been under consideration for some time and was <Col N="372" /> specifically addressed in the recent independent review of the programme by Deloitte &amp; Touche.</P>
      <P>That review recommended that the participation level should be reduced on a phased basis by 6,000 to 8,000 places. It also recommended a number of other reforms aimed generally at improving the targeting and outcomes of community employment and improving the quality of training and progression supports for participants.</P>
      <P>Since publication of the Deloitte &amp; Touche review my Department has had a number of discussions in P2000 fora with the social partners on the recommendations in the review and this consultation process is continuing. In parallel to this process but separate from it the Government in the 1999 Estimates, which were published in early December 1998, reduced the number of community employment places by 2,500 but increased the number of active labour market programme places under my Department alone by a net 8,875. This follows a deliberate strategy of increasing active labour market programme places with the best employability outcomes in order to maximise the progression of unemployed persons into jobs in the open economy.</P>
      <P>FÁS, as part of their responsibilities under the Labour Services Act, 1987, has operational responsibility for the delivery of the CE programme, including making decisions regarding the appropriate participation for individual unemployed persons subject to a maximum participation period of three years for each individual participant, and I have no role in regard to these matters.</P>

      <P>The British Government is committed in the Good Friday Agreement to making progress towards the objective of security normalisation in Northern Ireland, including a reduction in the numbers and role of the armed forces deployed there to levels compatible with a normal peaceful society.</P>
      <P>Some progress has already been made on the de-escalation of security measures, including the withdrawal of a number of battalions of the British Army and the ending of military patrols in much of Northern Ireland. A number of security installations on the Border and British Army structures in other areas have already been demolished. The full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement must involve further significant progress in security normalisation, including on the level of British Army deployment in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Allegations of collusion by the RUC, and other elements of the security forces, with loyalist paramilitaries have been made frequently over the years. These have caused widespread concern in the nationalist community and on the part of human rights organisations internationally.</P>
      <P>The Government has frequently raised these concerns within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and has also called for the full publication of the reports of the inquiries into allegations of collusion led by John Stevens in 1990 and 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of alleged collusion which has attracted the most prominence is the murder of <Col N="374" /> solicitor Patrick Finucane on 12 February 1989. The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Donnell, met with Pat Finucane's wife and other relatives of murder victims on 12 February 1999. At this meeting, a copy of a new report by British Irish Rights Watch into allegations of collusion in the murder of Pat Finucane and others was handed over to the Government. I understand that a copy was also given later that day to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The report, entitled Deadly Intelligence, State Involvement in Loyalist Murder in Northern Ireland, claims that new information has come to light regarding the involvement of the security forces in the murder of Pat Finucane and others. These allegations are very serious and have formed the basis for renewed discussions with the British side within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The Government has also raised the concerns which have been expressed regarding the handling of complaints against the RUC by Rosemary Nelson before her murder. I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to pursue these matters rigorously within the framework of the conference and in the context of the Good Friday Agreement's provisions on policing and justice.  </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the serious concerns which have been expressed in the nationalist community and on the part of human rights organisations about the role of the RUC in the investigation into the murder of Rosemary Nelson.</P>
      <P>On my instructions, the Department of Foreign Affairs has had extensive discussions with the British side within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference about the conduct of the investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder. The Government's view that the investigation must be independent and fully transparent has been conveyed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after Rosemary Nelson's murder on 15 March 1999, the Chief Constable of the RUC <Col N="375" /> invited the Chief Constable of Kent, Mr. David Phillips, to head the investigation with the assistance of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. On 17 March 1999, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair MP, stated in the House of Commons that this investigation would be independent and that its remit would be very wide. He repeated these assurances when the Taoiseach raised the murder of Rosemary Nelson directly with him in Berlin on 23 March 1999.</P>
    <P>In a further announcement on 29 March 1999, the Chief Constable of the RUC has indicated that the Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, Mr. Colin Port, is to assume responsibility for the day-to-day control, direction and command of the investigation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach met with Mr. Paul Nelson, in Belfast on 30 March 1999 to hear of his concerns regarding the investigation into his wife's murder. As the Taoiseach indicated to the House yesterday, the British Prime Minister is also considering these concerns. I can assure the Deputy that the Government will monitor closely the progress and outcome of the investigation now being led by British police officers, with the involvement of the FBI. It is essential that this investigation be conducted in such a manner that it is demonstrably independent, thorough and effective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the issue of legally held weapons in Northern Ireland has been raised on many occasions with the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and in discussions on the implementation of the security normalisation provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British authorities have stated that on 31 December 1998 there were 139,588 legally held firearms in Northern Ireland. In the Good Friday Agreement they made a commitment in the chapter on security normalisation to continued consultation on firearms regulation and control on the basis of the proposals published by the Secretary of State <Col N="376" /> for Northern Ireland on 2 April 1998. The British Government also committed itself to publishing an overall strategy for security normalisation.</P>
    <P>The number of legally held firearms in Northern Ireland is far above the average for areas of comparable size and economic profile and I am aware that it is a matter of particular concern to the nationalist community. All aspects of the Good Friday Agreement must be implemented in full, including those relating to security normalisation. The Deputy will be aware that the Government is at present engaged in intensive discussions to this end with the British Government and the parties.</P>

      <P>The hearing of members of the Defence Forces is cared for by a comprehensive range of measures designed to ensure the highest possible standard of hearing protection. These measures include education, protection, procedure and supervision. The hearing conservation regime in the Defence Forces meets all of the Health and Safety Authority guidelines and accords fully with best international standards. Personnel in the Defence Forces are trained in the proper care of hearing. This training is provided prior to annual range practices and includes written instruction, video demonstration, practical examination and certification of proper fitting of hearing protection.</P>
      <P>The procedures in place for the protection of hearing for personnel of the Defence Forces include the provision of ear plugs and passive ear muffs to be worn during annual range practices and on other occasions when exposure to gunfire is likely. Personnel who may be exposed to gunfire for extended periods, such as weapons instructors, are provided with active ear muffs. Ear plugs of an approved standard for musicians are provided for members of military bands. Personnel employed in noisy environments such as workshops and aircraft runways, etc, are required to wear appropriate hearing protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces are required to have an audiogram on enlistment and within one year of enlistment. Thereafter, audiograms are required annually, or at intervals of three years, in conformity with the Health and Safety Authority guidelines on hearing checks and audiometry. On the basis of this audiometry, and the <Col N="378" /> subsequent audiometry of an ENT specialist when indicated, each member of the Defence Forces is given a keenness of hearing grade as prescribed in Defence Force regulations. Utilizing this keeness of hearing grade, the Defence Forces care of hearing policy is applied to each individual so that noise exposure is progressively limited in personnel with hearing loss, and double ear defenders are required to be worn at all weapons firing exercises by personnel whose hearing is graded lower than grade 1. Procedures for the implementation of care of hearing during field training are prescribed in the relevant training circular.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the military authorities that the procedures laid down for the conservation of hearing are enforced rigorously throughout the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that of the nine countries contributing troops to the United Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, seven countries, including Ireland, provide full-time soldiers only in their contingents. Information regarding the proportion of reserve personnel relative to full-time personnel among those troop contributing countries who provide reserve personnel is not readily available.</P>
      <P>I have agreed that during the rotation of the Irish contingent in UNIFIL later this month, two members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, an officer and a non-commissioned officer, who are members of the consultative group to the special study on the Reserve Defence Forces, will visit UNIFIL.</P>

      <P>The relocation of the Naval Service and Air Corps headquarters to Haulbowline and Casement Aerodrome, respectively, was a key recommendation of the Price Waterhouse report. I have therefore directed that the flag officer commanding the Naval Service and his staff should relocate to the Naval base, Haulbowline, by 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>A total of 20 Naval Service personnel, eight officers and 12 other ranks, are currently stationed in Naval Service headquarters in Dublin. The costs of transferring this headquarters to the Naval base have not been quantified, but I understand that some of the accommodation earmarked in Haulbowline will require refurbishment and there will also be some furnishing and equipment costs. However, extra office accommodation in Dublin will become available to my Department as a consequence of the relocation. Change of station allowance will be paid to all eligible Naval Service and Air Corps personnel who are involved in these relocations.</P>
      <P>As was the case with the re-organisation of the Defence Forces, the reforms in the Naval Service and Air Corps will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and those of the taxpayer. The relocation of the Naval Service and Air Corps Headquarters are entirely logical and sensible and are in accordance with the principles of good management practice.</P>

      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote in updating military equipment for the Defence Forces. Total amounts spent on weapons, ammunition, transport, communications systems, and equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service over the past four years are as follows: 1995 £18 million, 1996 £20 million, 1997 £31 million and 1998 £37 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately £55 million will be spent on those areas this year and will include the following major items: &ndash; a new fishery patrol vessel, due for delivery later this year; the supply of 16 new turrets and 16 fire directing systems for fitting to existing Panhard armoured cars. The first two turrets and two fire directing systems were delivered earlier this week and the balance is expected to be delivered towards the end of this year; a contract for the supply of up to 40 armoured personnel carriers. It is expected that a contract will be in place later this <Col N="381" /> year and the first APCs should be delivered next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces was submitted to the efficiency audit group in 1993. Arising from this report, the <Col N="382" /> efficiency audit group made certain recommendations to the Government which were accepted in July 1995. Following this, an implementation group was set up to prepare a fully costed implementation plan covering the first three year phase of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces. In February 1996, the Government accepted the Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 which set the agenda for the initial phase of the Defence Forces reorganisation process.</P>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the overall Defence Forces reorganisation process thus far. Among the many objectives achieved I would like to highlight the following: a reduction in the overall PDF strength by 1,300 to 11,500 and the associated allocation of 50 per cent of the pay savings to infrastructure and equipment investment; an improvement in the age profile of the PDF by means of a successful voluntary early retirement scheme and a continuous recruitment policy; the successful introduction of a new structure for Defence Forces headquarters &ndash; a comprehensive reorganisation of the Army and completion of the studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    <P>In addition, on 15 July last, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally. Five barracks were subsequently evacuated and the sale of these will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to close any barracks other than those announced on 15 July 1998.</P>
    <P>The momentum for reform of the Defence Forces will continue by means both of the implementation plans for the reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval Service which are currently being drawn up and through the White Paper on Defence which will be completed later this year. I am also looking forward to receiving the report of the steering group for the study of the Reserve Defence Force in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received representations from the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on behalf of the chairman of the country sports concern group, concerning the excessive use of wire under the rural environment protection scheme. The representations included a report commissioned by the country sports concern group, the contents of which were taken into consideration in the recent revision of the REP scheme specifications. The REP scheme requires that all participants stockproof farm boundaries and the new specifications give every encouragement to planners and farmers to use barriers such as hedgerows and stonewalls when drawing up plans.</P>
      <P>In this regard the specifications point out that hedgerows provide an important wildlife habitat especially for woodland flora and fauna and maintenance practices have a direct bearing on the ability of a hedgerow to act as a stockproof barrier and its value for wildlife. The planner must set out in the plan the measures to be taken to maintain the hedgerow. Mature hedgerows in good condition should be allowed to grow naturally with maintenance confined to essential practices such as stockproofing, implanting with suitable species and control of invasive species. Where untended hedges have formed dense cover these may be left relatively undisturbed especially where this is not intrusive on normal farming operations.</P>
      <P>The position regarding stone walls is also clearly set out in the specifications. All existing stone walls must be retained and maintained in a manner traditional to the area. Existing walls which are prominent in the landscape but are in a state of disrepair must be repaired or rebuilt on a phased basis, subject to the availability of sufficient stones on site.</P>

      <P>An order has been made for the amalgamation of eight superintendent registrars districts and 19 registrars districts in County Donegal with effect from 1 April 1999. This is part of an ongoing national programme to amalgamate superintendent registrars' and registrars' districts and since 1993 a number of statutory instruments have been made by An tArd Chláraitheoir with the approval of the Minister for Health and Children to amalgamate districts in almost every county. The effect of these orders is to simplify the administration of the registration system, by amalgamating adjacent superintendent registrars' and registrars' districts, in particular where districts were administered by the same registrar, to allow the registration service to function in a more efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>The amalgamations in Donegal were fully discussed with the North-Western Health Board, which is the superintendent registrar in question and I am satisfied that local needs were taken into account before the recommendations for the amalgamations were finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of <Col N="389" /> eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Medical cards are granted to those who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health board are unable to provide, without undue hardship, medical and surgical services for themselves or their dependants. The hardship referred to here is financial hardship &ndash; which may of course result from medical hardship, e.g., high medical expenses. Any investments or savings &ndash; including redundancy payments &ndash; that could or should generate an income are taken into account in assessing income for medical card purposes. Interest from savings is taken into account but after that it is general practice to disallow a modest amount of savings when assessing the amount of savings/assets which could be redeemed as an income.</P>
      <P>Each application is dealt with on its merits. The health board chief executive officers operate an independent appeals process for those who consider that they have been unfairly assessed. Such persons can also bring their case to the attention of the Ombudsman. It should also be noted that where a family would not qualify for a medical card, an individual member of a family may qualify, e.g. if the family member's medical expenses were such as to jeopardise the income of the whole family.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. In <Col N="390" /> 1998 I approved additional funding of £200,000 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew. As a result, a total of 42 patients are now attending the unit each week.</P>
      <P>I am aware that further demand for access to this service exists and my Department will continue to work with the South-Eastern Health Board in identifying and addressing the board's overall service development needs. In this regard, expansion of dialysis services will continue to be considered in the context of the board's competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (registrars-general) of births, deaths and marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are 60 registrars' districts in the superintendence of the Western Health Board. In a number of areas, where small volumes of registration are involved, the same person has been appointed registrar to a number of adjoining districts. Consequently, there are 41 persons holding the office of registrar in the health board area. In addition to persons appointed as registrars, there are eight authorised officers employed in the registration service. A registrar is required under the Registration Acts to inform him/herself of every registerable event, including deaths, which occurs in his/her district and to register same, Copies of the entries in the register (certificates) are immediately available from the registrar at the time of registration. Thereafter, certificates may be obtained from either the registrar, while he has custody of the register, or from the superintendent registrar, after the filled register has been handed over to his custody. Certificates may be applied for by personal attendance at the office of the registrar, or superintendent registrar in which case copies of events registered are immediately available, and applications may be made by post. Because of the different modes of application and the number of offices involved it is difficult to attribute a meaningful average time span to the actual issue of certificates. However, if the Deputy has a particular situation in mind, he might communicate with An tArd-Chláraitheoir who would be pleased to investigate the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may also mention that registrars are obliged to make quarterly returns of all entries registered <Col N="391" /> in their registers of births, deaths and marriage to An tArd-Chláraitheoir to enable him to compile a national index to each type of event. Consequently copies of entries are available from An tArd-Chláraitheoir in due course.</P>

      <P>There is no restriction on staff of local authorities contesting local elections; the question of his or her continued tenure of office only arises when a successful candidate comes into office as a member of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Under section 21(1) of the Local Government Act, 1955, no person may hold any office of profit or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority while he or she is a member of that authority. By virtue of orders made under section 25(1) of the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act, 1974, this restriction no longer applies to non-officers or to certain lower level officers &ndash; basically officers at and below the level of clerical officer &ndash; or to coroners.</P>

      <P>Article 39 of the Housing Regulations 1980 set out the position regarding interest rates on house purchase loans as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the rate of interest on a loan shall be such rate as may be fixed by the housing authority making the loan, provided that the rate shall not be less than the rate at which the authority borrow money from the local loans fund at that time for that purpose and shall not be more than ½  per cent more than such rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The interest rate on local authority house purchase loans advanced in 1984 was a fixed rate of 12.5 per cent for the duration of the loan, terms which were not available from private lending agencies at a time of volatile interest rates.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 304 of 16 February 1999 and Question No. 70 of 9 March 1999. I am keenly aware of the importance of protecting hedgerows and avoiding the disturbance of wildlife during the nesting season. In the absence of native woodlands, hedgerows form an important feature for maintaining wildlife diversity, particularly for birds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 provides protection against the cutting, grubbing and burning of hedgerow on uncultivated land during the nesting season from 15 April to 31 August, subject to certain exceptions. This year, as in previous years, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department has written to all local authorities requesting that works to hedgerows be undertaken outside that crucial nesting period.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has underlined, in its guidance notes to local authorities on the Roads Act, 1993, and its road grants memorandum, the importance of carrying out roadside trimming during the winter season and that the timing of trimming work and the manner of its execution should minimise damage to the ecology of hedgerows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, the rural environment protection scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, also promotes the conservation and maintenance of existing features that make up farmland habitat such as hedgerows. The Deputy should also be aware that the issue of hedgerow conservation is receiving consideration by me in the context of the forthcoming amendment of the Wildlife Act and I expect to bring forward a number of amendments which will seek to strengthen the protective provisions applying to hedgerows. Furthermore, under the national biodiversity plan which I am preparing, some possible measures to improve the conservation of hedgerows have been identified and I intend to afford further con<Col N="396" /> sideration to those measures in the context of the finalisation of the plan.</P>

      <P>Financial assistance for child care, including financial assistance towards the establishment of crèche or pre-school facilities, is provided by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme. This two year programme contains three funding initiatives, viz. capital infrastructure, community support and employer demonstration. Each initiative has a separate budget with distinct criteria and targets. All three initiatives are interdependent and strive towards the common aim of improving the quality and quantity of child care provision in Ireland from an equal opportunities/ disadvantaged perspective. The equal opportunities child care programme is administered by Area Development Management Limited &ndash; ADM &ndash; on behalf of my Department. ADM is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies established by the Government.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme is funded by the Exchequer and the EU. A sum of £2.6 million was provided in my Department's Vote in 1998 for child care. Approximately £200,000 of this was Exchequer funding for the expert working group on child care. Of the remaining £2.4 million, 500,000 ECU &ndash; approximately £390,000 &ndash; was from the EU, while the balance, £2.01 million was provided by the Exchequer. In 1999, a total of £3.6 million has been provided in my Department's Vote for child care. This comprises 1.5 million ECU &ndash; approximately £1.18 million &ndash; from the EU, with the balance i.e. £2.42 million being provided by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Applications were invited in relation to the equal opportunities child care programme in the national newspapers and the closing date for receipt of applications for funding under this two year programme was May/June 1998. All funding is being allocated on the basis of applications received in advance of the May/June 1998 deadline. The bulk of this funding was allocated in July of last year and a further £450,000 approximately fails to be allocated this year in respect of applicants who met the qualifying criteria under the capital infrastructure strand of the programme. The allocation of child care funding to my Department post-1999 will be addressed in the context of the Estimates for the year 2000.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools. The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.

      <P>My Department's involvement in the area of pre-school education is currently confined to its support for the early start pre-school pilot programme, the Rutland Street pre-school project and pre-schools for traveller children. Expenditure on these services amounted to slightly in excess of £1 million in 1998.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I held a national forum for early childhood education. My objective in holding the forum was to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area. The report on the outcome of the forum has now been received in my Department and is being considered as part of the preparation of a White Paper on early childhood education which will set out my proposals for future development of services in this area. In advance of completion of the White Paper I recently announced an allocation of £1.2 million for special initiatives on early education. My intention is that this funding will be focused in particular on the development of early education services for children with disabilities. My Department is currently considering possible developments in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A child care measure was implemented for the <Col N="402" /> first time in 1998 for Youthreach, VTOS and traveller training programmes, with support from the European Social Fund. A budget of £544,000 was provided in 1998 through the vocational education committees and a further £2.15 million is available in 1999.</P>
    <P>Moneys have been allocated to the vocational education committees by my Department to enable funds to be used for direct provision of crèche facilities in centres, or in rented premises, including staff, equipment/refurbishment, rental, insurance and other overheads; purchase of places on existing community or commercial crèches and payment of child minders, subject to a maximum of £50 per child.</P>

      <P>Scoil Ui Fhiaich, Maynooth, County Kildare was granted temporary recognition by my Department in April 1997. While operating with temporary recognition, a school must provide a temporary premises suitable for school use. Grant aid at the rate of 75 per cent is provided by my Department towards rental costs for such accommodation.</P>
      <P>An application from the school for permanent recognition is being processed in my Department at present. It is only when permanent recognition has been granted that the school is entitled to claim capital grant-aid for the provision of permanent accommodation.</P>

      <Quest>the reason training for Mon tessori teachers in St. Nicholas House is not covered by the free third level fees system; the reason only part of the Montessori qualification can be achieved in VEC colleges, for example, St. Peter's, Killester; if he will examine the matter and bring equality to students studying for Montessori; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to St. Nicholas' Montessori College in Dún Laoghaire. This college is not included in the list of approved colleges to which the free fees initiative applies. As the question of the non-inclusion of courses in independent colleges within the free fees initiative is at issue in the case of Patrick Jordan Junior, Patrick Jordan Senior, Raymond Kearns and Barry Acton<i> v</i>. the Minister for Education, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not con<Col N="404" /> sider it appropriate for me to make any statement as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Students pursuing the two year Montessori diploma course in St. Peter's in Killester are awarded an NCVA level 2 certificate and a Montessori diploma awarded by St. Nicholas' Montessori College on successful completion of the course. This is an approved ESF-aided post-leaving certificate course and accordingly students may qualify for the award of a maintenance grant under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>The qualification awarded by St. Nicholas' Montessori College to students who successfully complete the two year course in St. Peter's is not the same as that awarded by the NCEA to students who follow the three year full-time course leading to the National Diploma in Humanities in Montessori Education in St. Nicholas Montessori College.</P>
