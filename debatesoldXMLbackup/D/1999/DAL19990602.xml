        <b>:</b> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance: the difficulties arising from fire fighters being forced into a strike arising from the failure of Dublin Corporation to reach agreement with them on their demands for an adequate level of coverage and investment in the fire service and adequate remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 6, on a Supplementary Order Paper, Motion re. Tribunal of Inquiry into HIV and Hepatitis C Infection of Haemophiliacs; No. 2, Major Events Television Coverage Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 3, Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the proceedings on No. 6, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion within two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make <Col N="1418" /> a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; and (2) the Dáil, on its rising on Thursday, 3 June 1999, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 June 1999.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot understand why the Government feels it necessary to adjourn the Dáil for all of next week. There is so much legislation waiting and we are approaching the recess.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to us that the only reason the Government wants the recess is to allow Ministers to go around the country with all their goody bags giving out taxpayers' money and, therefore, we do not agree with the Adjournment of the Dáil next week. There are enough people to keep the Dáil working next week who are not involved in the European or local elections and, therefore, we oppose the Adjournment of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Next Monday is a bank holiday and it is normal practice that the Dáil does not meet on the Tuesday anyway. Our Whip has discussed this matter with the Government Whip and we are not opposing it. However, let us be practical and realistic about this and stop playing games. Given that the House will not sit next week, and because of the increased agony of the relatives of the disappeared, will the Taoiseach make arrangements for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House today and make a definitive statement on the matter? It is a tragedy that reaches out to everybody's heart. The IRA and Sinn Féin must be held to account. I ask that the Order of the House make provision for a short statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at some stage today so that this House which enacted, at very short notice and with total co-operation, legislation to provide immunity for the crimes that were committed states clearly that there is at least the decency of pinpointing these bodies and returning them to their loved ones before it adjourns next week. There is no disagreement on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The behaviour of the provisional republican movement over recent days and, indeed, the past 25 years, on this subject deserves to be entered in the annals of infamy. I notice its <Col N="1419" /> representative in this House, as usual, is not here when this subject and others similar to it are raised. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that while any lingering hope remains the Garda will continue to carry out this search and the necessary resources will be made available? We owe that to the relatives whose trauma is indescribable &ndash; I have spoken to some of them. Injury is added to insult. It really is intolerable and we in this House and in this country have a right to be utterly angry at what these people are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the matter raised by Deputies Quinn and Currie, this House has passed emergency legislation to facilitate the effective cancellation of any charges on these matters, and I thank the House for doing so. We have also set up a commission and honourable people have taken up the positions of commissioners to try to assist in finding these bodies. Honest intermediaries have worked very hard and diligently in trying to pinpoint the locations and all have acted in good faith. Regrettably, the information does not seem to be satisfactory. We will continue to ensure that the Garda follow up this matter as long as there is evidence. I give that commitment to the House. We are keeping in touch with the families in as far as that is in our domain. I think the Minister will make a statement to the House today in so far as he has any information. If we receive further information while the House is in recess we will pass it on to party leaders or spokespersons.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter raised by Deputy Owen, she should know that in the normal course of events over a bank holiday weekend the House would not meet until Wednesday afternoon. We sat on Holy Week, but we already have a Whips' agreement that we would not meet next week. I find her attitude very surprising given that last week members of her party could not attend a very important committee meeting because they were all out canvassing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question for the Taoiseach in his well known role of football fan. When will the Government give direction to UEFA on Saturday's football game? We heard this morning that nothing has been said to UEFA about whether the Government supports the playing of the game on Saturday. The Irish players are working on the basis that the game is on and are feeling the tension that comes before a match. <Col N="1420" /> Yet UEFA says that the Government does not know whether it is coming or going and has not given it either a direct or indirect instruction. When will the Taoiseach do something about this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, I have a job to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation late last night. He will meet UEFA at approximately midday Irish time and he will also talk to FIFA. The Sports Ministers will also meet UEFA and FIFA. The Government awaits their decision, as we have done for some time, and the European Foreign Ministers also await that decision. I think it is unlikely that the match will be played, but there is also an important match next week and the team should keep training for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has an important match next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the deadline by which the Government must make a decision about the visas? Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform already made that decision? Have the visas been issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect no support in the House for this match going ahead, nor is there support for Ireland to be hit unilaterally while other EU states look on. However, there is the matter of the issuing of visas. Ireland is in effect representing the rest of Europe in this moral conflict and we should get support from the other European nations in a form and manner that has the effect we want. I urge the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure in negotiations that this match does not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be improper for us to predetermine what UEFA or FIFA may do. I have requested the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ask those bodies what the decision would be if this match was against England, France or Germany. I have also requested the Minister to ask those bodies to state their position, as they have said that nobody has contacted them, though that is not so as of early yesterday. I have requested that they state their position in saying that Ireland could be thrown out of the competition, that Ireland could concede the points or that a neutral venue in the sun could be picked. That would not suit our players and it is an entirely unrealistic position for that body to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UEFA is a respected body. I attended its European council dinner last year and spoke at it. However, it is not being fair in this instance and <Col N="1421" /> should declare its position. It knows what the players, management and the FAI want. It also knows what the Government and the Irish people want. UEFA has responsibilities and should make a decision. If it will not make that decision, we will do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the visas been issued? Obviously, the visas have not been issued, we have clarified that. The media has said that the visas are being issued, but that is not true. It appears that the Taoiseach is saying that he is waiting for other people to make a decision. Will the Government, through the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, make its position absolutely clear at today's meetings? There seems to be confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach properly referred to other countries. If this game was scheduled against Germany, France or Britain there would be quite a different response. Fortunately, the Taoiseach will be at a meeting tonight and tomorrow in Cologne with other Heads of Government. I urge him to seek unanimity among them in calling on UEFA officials and others to ensure this game does not go ahead. The same will happen tonight at the meeting of socialist leaders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated yesterday that there had been contact with UEFA on Monday. It is now quite clear that that was not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>UEFA was formally contacted yesterday morning. It had been previously contacted but it was formally contacted yesterday morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The spokesman said differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The spokesman was not being very realistic last night. It is not for the Government to force a sporting decision on a body. The body should make the decision and if it refuses, then we have a decision to make. I assure the <Col N="1422" /> House that we are not in the business of making an easy decision for anyone to throw Ireland out of a tournament. That would be entirely unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The firemen's strike will have commenced before we meet tomorrow morning if nothing happens today. Will the Taoiseach inform the House of the arrangements that are in place to provide cover in the event of that strike going ahead?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks on productivity measures broke down at 3 a.m. but Dublin Corporation will meet representatives of SIPTU this morning to discuss arrangements for emergency cover. In addition, army cover has been arranged. City and county managers in the other areas affected will also arrange emergency cover with SIPTU and other firefighters. In addition to army cover which will be provided initially in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Dublin other areas, including Sligo, Kilkenny, Dundalk and Drogheda, will depend on retained or part-time firemen who are not involved in the dispute. A public safety notice will be published in tomorrow morning's newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues in dispute are not far apart. Pay relativity between firefighters and gardaí is not an issue and the sides are close to agreement on the productivity issues. During the night the sides argued about redundancies and deployment of firefighters and this is an area which could be clarified. The parties should continue to talk <Col N="1423" /> today and should not assume the matter is over. I hope they do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check if those initiatives require legislation. I do not think they do but I will find out. Discussions on the initiatives have been taking place for some time and arrangements for them are in place. IBEC has been particularly helpful and approximately 60 people from the financial, banking and other areas have been formulating the initiatives and putting their structure together. These arrangements are ready to be put in place.</P>

      <P>For two years I have patiently raised the question of the protection of UN personnel and related persons. Those who attacked Irish troops in the Lebanon early this week can be prosecuted in 23 countries but not in Ireland. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the House that, as a mark of respect to the soldier who died this week, the necessary legislation will pass in the next session? Alternatively, will the Taoiseach accept the Private Members' Bill in my name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was hesitant when he said he would investigate the need for legislation regarding public private partnerships. In 1977, the Minister for Local Government, Sylvester Barrett, announced a scheme for a public private initiative to build toll roads. The first toll road was to have been the Naas bypass but the Fianna Fáil majority on Kildare County Council voted against the measure. Will the same thing happen next July?</P>

Is that still the case? Now that the committee has given its preliminary report, when can we expect to see this legislation, or is all the Taoiseach's talk about cleaning up politics simply a sham?</P>

Is it possible that the provision requiring public houses to close on Sunday between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. could be changed?

    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt): I move: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the serious public concern about&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)the contamination of relevant products with HIV and hepatitis C,</P>
    <P>(b)the number of infected persons, and</P>
    <P>(c)the consequences of infection for the health of those persons,</P>
    <P>RESOLVES that it is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as adapted by or under subsequent enactments and amended by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1997, and the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, to inquire urgently into, and report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to, the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>(1)which relevant products caused, or probably caused, the infection,</P>
    <P>(2)the adequacy of the criteria, standards and procedures applied by the Board for the purposes of its processing and manufacture of any relevant products found by the Tribunal to have or probably to have caused the infaction with regard to&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)donor selection,</P>
    <P>(b)donor screening,</P>
    <P>(c)donor testing,</P>
    <P>(d)plasma quarantine,</P>
    <P>(e)virus inactivation,</P>
    <P>(f)product recall,</P>
    <P>and the timeliness of the application of such criteria, standards, and procedures,</P>
    <P>(3)the adequacy and timeliness of the decisions of the Board and other relevant persons in the State in the selection of any relevant products found by the Tribunal to have or probably to have caused the infection,</P>
    <P>(4)the considerations that influenced the Board when deciding to  implement a policy of self-sufficiency by using plasma  collected or recovered within the State for the processing or manufacture by it or the manufacture by other manufacturers of relevant prod<Col N="1426" /> ucts, and the adequacy and timeliness of the implementation of that policy,</P>
    <P>(5)the considerations that influenced the decisions of the Board and other relevant persons in the State in the selection of the manufacturers of any relevant products found by the Tribunal to have or probably to have caused the infection and the adequacy of the criteria, standards and procedures applied by those persons in such selection with regard to&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)donor selection,</P>
    <P>(b)donor screening,</P>
    <P>(c)donor testing,</P>
    <P>(d)plasma quarantine,</P>
    <P>(e)virus inactivation,</P>
    <P>(f)product recall,</P>
    <P> on the part of the manufacturers of those products and the timeliness of such application,</P>
    <P>(6)the time when the Board and other relevant persons in the State became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, that relevant products had become, or that there was a risk that they would become, a source of infection,</P>
    <P>(7)the adequacy and timeliness of the response of the Board and other relevant persons in the State to their becoming aware of the matters referred to in subparagraph (6) and, in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing)&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)the actions taken by the Board and those persons to identify persons likely to have been affected by the matters aforesaid, to inform them of those matters and to offer them HIV or hepatitis C testing, and</P>
    <P>(b)the action taken by the Board and those persons to reduce or minimise the risk of infection having regard to those matters,</P>
    <P>(8)the adequacy and timeliness of the response of the Minister, the Department of Health and Children, and other relevant persons in the State, when they became aware of the fact that there were infected persons,</P>
    <P>(9)the adequacy of the donor selection and donor screening procedures that&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)were employed by the Board from and including the year 1980 <Col N="1427" /> to and including the month of October, 1985, and</P>
    <P>(b)were intended to exclude potential donors who had, or might have been exposed to infection with, HIV,</P>
    <P>(10)whether the introduction by the Board in the month of October, 1985, of donor testing for HIV was timely, having regard to international experience and any other relevant circumstances,</P>
    <P>(11)in respect of recipients of whole blood, blood components and blood products derived from donations made in the State prior to the introduction of HIV testing in the month of October, 1985, by donors who were subsequently diagnosed as positive for HIV, the adequacy and timeliness of the procedures adopted by the Board to identify those recipients,</P>
    <P>(12)the circumstances surrounding the issue by the Board on an emergency basis in the month of December 1985, of untested platelet concentrate and the adequacy of the response of the Board when the donor of the platelets was subsequently diagnosed as positive for HIV,</P>
    <P>(13)in respect of any relevant products found by the Tribunal to have or probably to have caused the infection, whether the Minister, the Department of Health and Children, the National Drugs Advisory Board and any other relevant person, carried out his, her or its functions (including, in the case of the National Drugs Advisory Board, advising the Minister on the granting of Product Authorisations and Licences for the manufacture, importation, distribution or sale of such products) adequately and properly and whether those functions were the appropriate ones having regard to international standards,</P>
    <P>(14)whether the supervision by the Minister of the Board and the National Drugs Advisory Board, in so far as relevant to any matter referred to in the foregoing subparagraphs was adequate and appropriate having regard to the functions, duties and responsibilities of the Minister, and for the purposes of the inquiry the Tribunal shall investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant to any of the matters <Col N="1428" /> set out in the foregoing subparagraphs in so far as the Tribunal considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so and considers that the procedures adopted for that purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the investigation.</P>
    <P>AND FURTHER RESOLVES that&ndash;</P>
    <P>(I)in performing its functions, the Tribunal shall have due regard to  relevant medical and scientific opinion and practice prevailing at the relevant times,</P>
    <P>(II)bearing in mind the desirability that the interests of persons with haemophilia, their immediate families, and their next of kin, who wish to be represented at the Tribunal by the Irish Haemophilia Society ('the Society') should, if possible, be so represented, the Tribunal shall, if it is satisfied that it is just and convenient to do so, accede to any application made by or on behalf of the Society for such representation and the Tribunal shall in its discretion determine whether such representation should be full or limited,</P>
    <P>(III)the Tribunal shall report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann on an interim basis not later than four months from the date of establishment of the Tribunal and also as soon as reasonably may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the Tribunal on the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)the number of parties then represented before the Tribunal,</P>
    <P>(b)the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and the work of the Tribunal,</P>
    <P>(c)the likely duration, (so far as that may then be capable of of being estimated) of the proceedings of the Tribunal,</P>
    <P>(d)any other matters that the Tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report (including any matter relating to its terms of reference),</P>
    <P>(IV)the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> (V)all persons employed in the Departments of State and State agencies concerned shall give their full co-operation to the Tribunal and those Departments of State and agencies shall themselves fully co-operate with the Tribunal by providing it with all the documents and information requested of them that are in their possession or power, and</P>
    <P>(VI)the anonymity of persons with haemophilia and their next of kin shall be preserved, if they so wish unless the Tribunal considers it would be unjust to do so.</P>
    <P>In this resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;infected person' means a person with haemophilia or any other blood clotting disorder who has been infected with HIV or hepatitis C through the administration in the State of a relevant product, and 'infection' shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the Minister' means the Minister for Health and Children;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;person' includes a body corporate and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;relevant product' means a blood product or a blood component for administration to persons in the State to treat them for haemophilia or other blood clotting disorders in respect of those conditions;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the Board' means the Blood Transfusion Service Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this motion is to authorise the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to investigate the infection of persons with haemophilia, and related matters. The Fianna Fáil manifesto contained a commitment to establish an inquiry into the hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia, and into the HIV contamination of blood and blood products and I am pleased to be in a position to give effect to this commitment today. The tribunal will investigate a number of matters related to blood and blood products that do not directly affect persons with haemophilia and I will elaborate on these in due course.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking up office, I met the Irish Haemophilia Society which represents haemophiliacs and their families who have been directly affected by the contamination of blood products with HIV and hepatitis C. Haemophilia is a blood clotting disorder caused by deficiencies in blood coagulation factors. The proposed terms of reference for the tribunal cover persons with haemophilia and other blood clotting disorders, such as Von Willebrands disease, who have been infected with HIV and hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> The treatment for factor deficiencies consists of replacing the missing factors with blood derivatives to allow normal clot formation and thus avoid haemorrhage. Persons with blood clotting disorders are not only frequent users of blood products but also are reliant totally on blood products for their quality of life. The Minister was pleased to authorise the replacement of plasma derived Factor 8 product with a synthetic or recombinant product in September 1997. Recombinant Factor 9 has recently become available.</P>
    <P>The viral infection of blood products is a crucial issue for the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members, who relied and continue to rely on the society so much. The society had hoped that the infection of its members would have been investigated by the tribunal of inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Finlay. The tribunal took the view, however, that its terms of reference precluded it from investigating the hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia. It also took the view that it would not have been practical to extend the terms of reference of its inquiry to include these matters. As a result, the society withdrew from the tribunal on 15 January 1997 on the grounds that the issues of concern to it and its members were not being addressed.</P>
    <P>It was imperative to avoid a repetition of these events. For that reason the Minister entered into consultations with the society with a view to identifying the issues of public importance which required investigation by the tribunal. This has proved a long and difficult process. I reject, however, any suggestion that the Minister or his officials have been seeking to delay the establishment of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In preparing the terms of reference the Government's approach has been to ensure that the terms of reference would allow the tribunal to discharge its task efficiently and effectively; the tribunal was workable and that the terms would cover matters which were capable of being investigated; the tribunal was not required to embark on a long drawn out inquiry with little expectation of a useful outcome and that fair procedure issues were properly addressed.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our experience in recent years with various tribunals of inquiry, the House will agree it is essential that a tribunal is given terms of reference that are reasonably clear and unambiguous. It is far better to spend some time preparing workable terms of reference than to establish a tribunal with an unclear mandate that may run into the sand.</P>
    <P>Among the complex issues that arise in the present context are the fact that, unlike the Finlay tribunal, the proposed tribunal will investigate matters relating to two different infections, hepatitis C and HIV, and that it will deal not with one blood product but a number of products and blood components. Some of the products were manufactured here, others abroad. Some were manufactured abroad using plasma donated here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> It was the international dimension of the matter that proved the most difficult and complex aspect in the preparation of the terms of reference. As it appears that most blood products implicated in the infection were manufactured abroad, the question arose as to whether the tribunal should inquire into the relevant operations of the pharmaceutical companies concerned. It was necessary for the Minister to take legal advice on the extra-territorial jurisdiction of an Irish tribunal. Senior counsel's advice was obtained. It was also necessary to seek advice from US lawyers.</P>
    <P>The advice the Minister received was to the effect that in order for the tribunal to fully investigate the adequacy of the actions of US based pharmaceutical companies it would have to be able to secure the discovery of documents and the attendance of witnesses; as a tribunal is not a court, it is unlikely that US courts would be able to assist by enforcing discovery orders or compelling the attendance of witnesses; if the tribunal was unable to obtain discovery on critical matters from US sources or to take evidence from key witnesses in the US, serious fair procedures issues could arise if Irish witnesses could plausibly assert that they had relied on the US pharmaceutical companies and agencies and that, because of the inability of the tribunal to investigate those companies or agencies, they were being saddled with the entirety of the blame for the medical catastrophes that occurred; any attempt by the tribunal to investigate the actions of US regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration could give rise to novel problems of jurisdiction with complex legal, political and, possibly, diplomatic ramifications; if such an all-encompassing inquiry were to be set in motion, the tribunal could take up to five years to complete its task with no guarantee that it would succeed in making any substantial progress on the issues surrounding the infection of persons with haemophilia from foreign-sourced products.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the legal advice, the practicalities of the situation had to be reflected in the drafting of the terms of reference, otherwise, we would have found ourselves in the position of having a tribunal which was unable to fully complete its examination of the matters referred to it by the Oireachtas. The Irish Haemophilia Society was understandably anxious that the terms of reference would address fully its concerns in relation to the international dimension of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference now include a provision which will enable the tribunal to investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant in so far as the tribunal considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so and considers that the procedures adopted for the purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> The tribunal will examine in particular the decisions taken within the jurisdiction in relation to the importation of blood products found to have caused the infection. It will be open to the tribunal to compare the actions and omissions here with those in other jurisdictions, to hear evidence from international experts, to examine international research and publications, and to seek information and assistance from the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centre for Disease Control and the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>The drafting of terms of reference which, on the one hand, addressed the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the investigation of matters arising outside the State and, on the other, reflected the practicalities as set out in the legal advice proved a most difficult and time-consuming task which required intensive input from the Minister, the Attorney General, their officials and the Irish Haemophilia Society. I am pleased that the proposed draft of the terms of reference, as approved by the Government, achieves this objective in a manner which is acceptable to the society. I record my appreciation of the efforts of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I will outline the detailed provisions of the terms of reference, the interpretation of which is primarily a matter for the tribunal. I would not want anything I say to be taken as an attempt to interfere with the tribunal in the performance of its functions. It would be helpful to Members, however, to indicate what the terms of reference are intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>The first part of the terms of reference includes the substantive matters of public importance which the tribunal will be required to investigate. The tribunal will ascertain, in so far as it is able to do so, which of the blood products administered to persons with haemophilia caused, or probably caused, infection with HIV or hepatitis C. These conclusions are of fundamental importance to the tribunal's investigations and I expect that, when these conclusions have been reached, the tribunal will proceed to examine all the other matters set out in the terms of reference as they relate to the products in question. The products which will be under examination will include all relevant products, that is, products used to treat persons with haemophilia for that condition, whether manufactured or processed within the State or imported from other countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to products or components processed or manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board which are found by the tribunal to have caused, or probably caused, infection with HIV or hepatitis C, the tribunal will examine whether the procedures and standards applied by the board at the relevant times were adequate. In examining this and the other substantive issues, the tribunal will take account of the international standards which prevailed at the relevant time. The standards of the time are the benchmark against which procedures such as, for example, <Col N="1433" /> donor selection and donor screening, should be examined.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will examine the decisions taken by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and by any of the persons within the State involved in choosing the treatment therapies for persons with haemophilia, in relation to whether the therapies were the suitable ones in the light of the information available at the time. It will be for the tribunal to determine what persons in the State are relevant to its inquiries in this and other matters it is investigating.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will examine the reasoning behind the decision of the Blood Transfusion Service Board to implement a policy of self-sufficiency, whether the decision was the right one on the basis of the prevailing international standards, and whether the policy itself was implemented in a timely manner. A policy of self-sufficiency means utilising Irish plasma for the manufacture of clotting factor concentrates rather than relying on plasma collected abroad and, subsequently, used for the manufacture of products for use in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to any blood products imported for treatment of persons with haemophilia which are found by the tribunal to have caused, or probably to have caused, infection with HIV or hepatitis C, the tribunal will examine the criteria and standards applied by the BTSB and other persons responsible for deciding which products to import when selecting those products. For example, the tribunal will examine what standards were required in the donor screening procedures applied by the manufacturer of that relevant product. It will also examine the timeliness of the application of these criteria.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will investigate when any of the persons relevant to the inquiry first became aware of the risk to persons with haemophilia because of the contamination of blood products. It will also investigate whether those persons should reasonably to have been aware of the risk earlier. It will examine the response of relevant persons when they became aware of the risk to persons with haemophilia, in particular, what actions were taken to identify persons with haemophilia who had been treated with the products concerned, whether they were duly informed of the risk, and whether they were offered hepatitis C and HIV testing when such tests became available. The tribunal will also examine the actions to reduce the risk for persons with haemophilia and will examine whether the response of the Minister for Health and his Department was adequate when they became aware that persons with haemophilia had contracted hepatitis C and HIV through the administration of blood products. Paragraphs (1) to (8) of the terms of reference, as outlined relate specifically to matters relevant to the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. The tribunal will also investigate a number of other matters relating to blood products and components which are not directly relevant to persons with haemophilia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The tribunal will investigate the circumstances of the infection with HIV of the person known as Mary Murphy, or &ldquo;the Kilkenny health worker&rdquo;, as a result of receiving a blood transfusion in 1985. Ms Mary Murphy received a transfusion of whole blood in July 1985. The donor in question returned to donate again in September 1986, at which stage it was found that the donor was HIV positive. The donation of September 1986 was discarded, but, regrettably, no lookback was carried out on previous donations given by the donor, including the donation which was administered to Mary Murphy. Accordingly, it was not until 1996 that Ms Murphy discovered that she had contracted the virus, and established the source of her infection.</P>
    <P>The issues relevant to Mary Murphy's infection with HIV are encompassed in paragraphs (8), (9) and (10) of the terms of reference as follows: Paragraph (9) &ndash; The tribunal will examine the protocols operated by the Blood Transfusion  Service Board, prior to the introduction of a HIV test for donors, to try to minimise the risk of HIV-positive donors donating blood. Donor testing for HIV was introduced by the BTSB in October 1985. Ms Murphy received her blood transfusion in July 1985, some months prior to the introduction of the HIV test. Paragraph (10) &ndash; The tribunal will examine whether the introduction by the BTSB in October 1985 of a HIV test for donors was timely, having regard to international experience and any other relevant circumstances. Paragraph (11) &ndash; The tribunal will examine the adequacy of the actions taken by the BTSB to trace the recipients of previous blood donations from donors who, following the introduction of the HIV test for donors in October 1985, were found to be HIV positive.</P>
    <P>I understand that between 1985 and 1989, the BTSB did not conduct lookback procedures in respect of the previous donations of donors who tested HIV positive under the new test, although once the donor tested HIV positive, his or her current donation was discarded. From 1989 onwards, the BTSB had a lookback procedure for newly presenting HIV positive donors, and they updated their lookback procedures in 1993.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (12) deals with the second of the non-haemophiliac issues that are to be investigated by the tribunal. This paragraph deals with the release by the BTSB of untested platelet concentrate, which was administered to a particular patient in December 1985, the donor of which was subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive.</P>
    <P>This case came to light during the investigations that followed the Mary Murphy case. I understand it was practice for the BTSB to issue untested platelet concentrates in emergency situations because the HIV test at the time was slow, and the short shelf life of platelets &ndash; 72 hours at the time &ndash; meant there was not time to await the result. All of the donations associated with these platelets were tested on the next testing day and none was confirmed positive for the mandatory markers of the time, including HIV, <Col N="1435" /> except for one platelet concentrate issued in December 1985 which tested HIV positive. The tribunal will examine all the circumstances surrounding the issue of this platelet concentrate, including the response of the BTSB when it emerged that the donor was HIV positive.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will examine the roles of the Minister, the Department and the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to any products which are found by the tribunal to have caused, or probably to have caused, the infection with HIV and, hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia, particularly in relation to their respective roles in the granting of product authorisations and licences. The tribunal will also examine whether the statutory functions of the relevant persons were appropriate in themselves, having regard to the prevailing international standards.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will examine whether the Minister carried out his functions adequately and appropriately in relation to his supervision of the BTSB and the National Drugs Advisory Board in respect of all matters being examined by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The second part of the terms of reference contains what might be called the procedural terms in that they relate to the manner in which the inquiry is to be carried out rather than to the substantive matters the tribunal will investigate. Section 1 provides that the tribunal shall take account of the scientific opinion and practice which was prevalent at the time when the matter being investigated arose. This section is very important, as the bulk of the matters to be investigated by the tribunal arose more than a decade ago. Subsequent research and knowledge has added significantly to the understanding of the viruses and to improvements in serological testing for virus antigens. It would be most unfair to judge actions at a time when very little was known about a particular virus on the basis of current medical and scientific opinion and practice when so much more knowledge is generally available.</P>
    <P>Section 2 recognises the special position of the Irish Haemophilia Society, representing as it does the body of persons directly affected by the HIV and hepatitis C infection of blood products. It would be desirable that the society be granted representation before the tribunal, both to protect the interests of its members and to ensure the tribunal is given the benefit of the society's expert knowledge and experience gained over 30 years of representing persons with haemophilia. However, decisions in respect of representation are entirely at the discretion of the tribunal. This section fully recognises the authority of the tribunal in deciding on representation and whether it should be full or limited.</P>
    <P>Section 3 requires the tribunal to make two interim reports, the first not later than four months after its establishment and another after ten days of hearings. I anticipate that when the chairperson of the tribunal is appointed, as well <Col N="1436" /> as the various legal teams, a significant lead-in time will be required to allow all concerned to become familiar with the matters to be dealt with by the tribunal, particularly as many of them have detailed scientific and technical aspects. I consider that four months from the date of establishment would be a suitable time for the submission of an interim report giving details of progress to date. By that time I expect the question of representation before the tribunal should be settled.</P>
    <P>After ten days of oral hearings the tribunal should be in a position to estimate the likely duration of its proceedings and will report to the Dáil in relation to this and any other matters on an interim basis at that stage. The tribunal might also at that stage have some comment to make on the terms of reference. It is impossible at this stage to estimate how long the tribunal is likely to continue, and it is only when the tribunal has had the opportunity to examine the documentation which will be made available to it that it will be in a position to advise the House in relation to its expected duration.</P>
    <P>Section 4 requires the tribunal to examine the matters referred to it economically, efficiently and effectively. Section 5 requires that all persons employed by bodies under the aegis of the State who are relevant to the inquiry to co-operate fully with the tribunal, including providing it with all the documents and information it requests, if it is in their power to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires the tribunal to protect the anonymity of persons with haemophilia, other recipients of whole blood, blood components or blood products, donors, and their next of kin. I expect that the tribunal would only refuse anonymity in exceptional cases, for example, if it was necessary to protect the constitutional rights of third parties. The text of the original motion which was circulated to Deputies referred to the anonymity of persons with haemophilia only. I consider that donors and recipients of other blood components and blood products, including the Kilkenny health worker, should be afforded anonymity in similar circumstances. With the agreement of the Ceann Comhairle, I have circulated the text of a motion which incorporates this clarification.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the primary purpose of the tribunal is to investigate the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. While the Minister very much regrets the pain and suffering caused to all of those who have been affected by the infection of blood and blood products, the impact on the haemophilia community has been particularly devastating. I am informed by the Irish Haemophilia Society that 210 of its members were infected with hepatitis C between the mid-1970s and 1990. One hundred and three persons with haemophilia were infected with HIV during the 1980s. Given that haemophilia is an inherited condition, a relatively small number of families have been affected. However, the toll in human lives has been great, with a total of 67 people, including a number of children, <Col N="1437" /> dying as a result of their infection with these viruses. The loss of so many people, particularly the loss of children, is a tragedy of immense proportions. The loss of fathers, sons and brothers is still deeply felt by their families and friends and the passage of time has not served to diminish the strength of their feelings. The bereaved families consider that there are many questions which need to be answered concerning the cause of the infections and whether they could have been avoided. I am satisfied that the terms of reference for the tribunal will enable it to address these questions and, hopefully, assist the families in finally coming to terms with their loss. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the motion is before the House. The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, gave a commitment that such a tribunal would be established. When the current Government came into office it was not envisaged that it would take so long for the terms of reference to be agreed. It is of substantial importance that the Irish Haemophilia Society was involved in discussions with the Government and, in particular, with the Department of Health and Children, concerning the details of the terms of reference. The society deserves much praise for the work it has done and the extraordinarily restrained way in which it has carried it out. At no stage has the society attempted to make the length of time it has taken to establish the tribunal a political issue between political parties. My understanding is that the society has largely dealt with officials of the Minister's Department. It is noteworthy that it was only in a letter dated 14 May that, for the first time, the society complained in particular to Members of the House about the time it was taking to agree the terms of reference. Subsequent to that letter being received by Members whatever difficulties existed between the society and departmental officials were resolved. There is nothing to be gained by dwelling on this matter, other than to say that it should have proved possible to have agreed these terms of reference somewhat earlier, although I appreciate the complexity of the legal difficulties, particularly in dealing with pharmaceutical companies outside the State.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the motion and will not raise objections to it or seek to have it amended. The only issue I wished to raise was that referred to by the Minister of State, Dr. Moffatt, namely, the extension of anonymity to all those who come before the tribunal. The Minister has circulated amended terms of reference dealing with this issue in a proper and welcome manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this issue is one of a major tragedy and events befalling people which should not have happened. Without prejudging the findings of the tribunal, I find it completely inexplicable that the BTSB failed to conduct the look-back programme in the 1980s, referred to by the Minister, upon discovering the difficulties which existed with the blood product. The great tragedy <Col N="1438" /> is that since these difficulties were discovered only two people in this country, as I understand it, have died as a result of haemophilia while during the same period there have been 67 deaths of haemophiliacs who were the recipients of defective blood products, 103 people have been infected with HIV and 210 people have been infected with hepatitis C. It must be acknowledged that a State agency grossly failed these people, failed to ensure the safety of the blood products it was providing and, even more extraordinarily, on discovering the particular donors were not suitable, failed to conduct a lookback programme to ascertain who had been administered blood products derived from those donors at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>There are two or three issues I want to raise with the Minister in a constructive way. There is a reference to the difficulties on which the Minister sought advice concerning the pharmaceutical companies which supplied blood product from outside the State. There is also a reference to the tribunal being able to seek information and assistance from the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centre for Disease Control, as well as the pharmaceutical industry. In his reply I ask the Minister to indicate, apart from the legal advice which he obtained concerning the difficulties which the tribunal could experience in this regard, whether there has been any direct contact between the Minister or his Department with the relevant pharmaceutical companies concerned which are readily identifiable? Has there been a communication with them in advance of these terms of reference coming before this House to ask whether they will co-operate with the tribunal? Will they voluntarily present to the tribunal all relevant documentation it seeks? Will they provide witnesses to the tribunal? I think we are entitled to clarification of that matter.</P>
    <P>There is preliminary ground work which the Department could have done in advance of the establishment of the tribunal which would clarify the position in this regard. It may be that such ground work has been done and if it has, the House should be told. If it has not been done, we should be told why not. It is a basic and important issue in terms of getting at the truth of the events which occurred. For example, have we been told by any of these pharmaceutical companies that they will not co-operate? What contacts have there been with the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centre for Disease Control in advance of the motion coming before the House to indicate the extent to which they will facilitate the tribunal by presenting evidence or documentation to it or by nominating persons to give evidence to it. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that because I could see the tribunal, with all its best endeavours, becoming long and drawn out if no preliminary ground work has been done in these areas by the Department because the tribunal will be coming to it completely anew.</P>
    <P>Another considerably important issue relevant not just to this tribunal but to the Finlay tribunal <Col N="1439" /> and some of the inquiries which have been conducted in the child abuse area, is that the law is deficient in so far as there are no specific criminal offences prescribed which could result in the indictment of public bodies or officials who either recklessly or with gross negligence carry out their duties to the detriment of the community. For example, prosecutions have been brought in France as a result of the supply of contaminated blood products. In Spain there is particular legislation in this regard. I am not saying such legislation could apply retrospectively &ndash; I do not believe it can because there is a constitutional difficulty in that regard.</P>
    <P>The time has come, however, when we must recognise that there are a number of different bodies in the State who provide fundamentally important services to the community. The community relies on their insight and expertise in the provision of those services. I am not saying that people will not, on occasion, make mistakes but there is a difference between a minor error and a body exercising its important functions recklessly or with gross negligence. There is a difference between a body getting something slightly wrong and which has no particularly detrimental impact on anyone, and a body discovering that a product, which it has made available to the community and which it withdraws, could have caused life-threatening illness to people to whom it has already been administered.</P>
    <P>We need a new criminal legislative provision so that it is a particular criminal offence for a public body or an individual employed by a public body either to act recklessly or with gross negligence in carrying out the duties for which the body is formed in a manner which causes serious injury to those to whom the body has an obligation to serve. I ask the Minister the extent to which the Government has considered the possibility of changing the law in this area for the future. It should be clear to people acting in a public function that, where what they are doing could cause a risk to life or limb and where they do not do it with a reasonable degree of care and act recklessly or with gross negligence, they may be liable to criminal and not just civil sanction. We should move towards the type of legal provision which exists in other EU countries, even if it does not exist in the UK. It is an important change which we need to make.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal. The Minister of State said the tribunal should be functioning by the autumn. How soon will the Government nominate a member of the Judiciary to this tribunal? Will we know that in advance of the summer vacation? In the context of someone being nominated, is there a possibility, as is always necessary in such tribunals, that the tribunal could hold its initial sitting prior to the summer vacation so that it can make decisions about its procedural approaches and any legal assistance which may be required? I want the Minister to clarify, in the context of the establish<Col N="1440" /> ment of the tribunal and the work it must undertake, whether it will have the assistance of additional lawyers other than the judge appointed to sit on it? Will the tribunal simply receive evidence or will it have available to it any specialist medical assistance to which the person sitting on the tribunal may wish to turn to have particular issues clarified? It would be important that we know the Minister's thinking in these particular areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the terms of reference. I hope it proves possible for the tribunal to carry out its functions speedily. I have reservations about the fact that, according to the Minister of State, the tribunal will not meet until the autumn. It is important that the tribunal sits before the traditional legal vacation period, which starts in August. The tribunal should at least commence a process of obtaining submissions, inform the general public of when it intends to sit and list the witnesses and other individuals who may come before it. I am not optimistic that it will prove possible for the tribunal to complete its work this year, but it is in the interests of everyone concerned that it completes it work as speedily as possible because it has taken a considerable time to agree the terms of reference and to establish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support the motion. I congratulate the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members, those living with haemophilia and those who have lost loved ones who were haemophiliacs. Their's has been a long, hard and drawn out struggle which goes back over the past 14 years or so. The past two and a half years have been spent in negotiations with the Government, even though the decision had already been made by the previous Government to establish a tribunal of inquiry to ascertain the truth about the circumstances surrounding the infection of people with haemophilia. I welcome the outcome of all that work, effort, anguish and pain.</P>
      <P>The infection of haemophiliacs with AIDS and hepatitis C has rightly been described as one of the worst health catastrophes ever to occur in the history of the State. Out of a total population of just over 400 people, 103 people with haemophilia were infected with HIV. Tragically, 59 of these people have died from factors arising from their HIV infection. Almost all the children infected with HIV have died. Approximately 260 members of the Irish Haemophilia Society have become infected with either HIV or hepatitis C or both. Eight people with haemophilia have died from factors arising from hepatitis C infection. Over the past 16 years, 69 people with haemophilia have died, 67 of whom died as a result of the medical treatment they received. Given the inherited nature of haemophilia, this devastating death toll included sons, brothers, cousins and grandchildren from the same extended families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A haemophilia community is inevitably a small one and behind the grim statistics lies a story of decimated families, destroyed lives and <Col N="1441" /> immeasurable suffering, which will undoubtedly unfold during the course of the tribunal of inquiry. It is a terrible irony that the source of this suffering was hailed as a wonder drug at the time. It offered the hope of life but turned out, in reality, to be a death sentence for many people. These people and their families are entitled to know how and why the disaster happened and who was responsible for it. Specific issues in relation to the safety of blood products require answers &ndash; why, for example, certain people with haemophilia appear to have become infected at an inappropriate time in light of the current medical and international standards applicable and why, although commercially obtained concentrates from the plasma of paid donors were first suspected of carrying the HIV virus as early as 1982, these products continued to be supplied to Irish people with haemophilia. Alternative treatment options should have been made available which could have minimised the risk of further HIV infection. Ireland only pursued a policy of self-sufficiency relating to blood products derived from Irish plasma in 1986, subsequent to the time period when commercially obtained blood products were already safe from HIV infection. Why did this happen? The tribunal must answer these questions.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Irish Haemophilia Society have had to endure this tragedy in silence and isolation, without the comfort or possibility of knowing what went wrong and without the comfort of knowing that these mistakes will never be repeated. The tribunal of inquiry is designed to provide that security and information. However, we should not underestimate the impact it will have on people who are trying to get on with their lives. It will be difficult for families and haemophiliacs themselves to participate in the tribunal. The tribunal will be traumatic and demanding for people who have already suffered unbearably. For many it will mean reliving the tragedy of their lives and will require the kind of fortitude which has characterised their campaign for truth from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>Living with viral infections has been a devastating experience for the people involved. People have lived with sickness and death. Yet, the Irish Haemophilia Society had to struggle on their behalf to obtain commitments from the State on health care facilities for those who contracted HIV and to recompense in monetary terms those afflicted with HIV and AIDS for basic facilities. The compensation package amounted to approximately £7.7 million and was offered at a most difficult time for members of the Irish Haemophilia Society. At that time, the society was required to deal with members coming to terms with their HIV diagnosis, deteriorating health, death and bereavement. It is only right that what was seen as the best option against such a backdrop, where people were dying or very ill, is now being revisited.</P>
    <P>The Government has given a welcome commitment to review the adequacy of the compensation <Col N="1442" /> package to ensure a fair and equitable settlement. It must also be a swift settlement as we are dealing in many cases with a race against time. There must not be a repeat of the two and a half year delay experienced in getting to this point in regard to the terms of reference. I understand that a simple change in legislation may be all that is required in regard to the issue of compensation, but it is vital that the Minister expresses a determination to deal with this issue fairly, which he has done, and to commit himself to a speedy settlement. I regret that the issue of compensation was not mentioned in the Minister's speech. However, I am aware that at the same time the Cabinet agreed the draft terms of reference, a decision was also made to reopen the compensation issue.</P>
    <P>We must remember that further practical issues impact on daily life for these people. It is impossible, for example, for them to obtain life assurance or mortgage protection insurance to protect their homes and families. There is the fear of being shunned in their neighbourhoods arising from the prejudice which may exist with regard to these viral infections. The have had to face the stigmatisation and hysteria prevalent, especially in the 1980s, about HIV and, latterly, about hepatitis C. They face the fear of transmission of HIV and hepatitis C to partners and must suffer the financial consequences arising from the inability to work due to adverse health.</P>
    <P>These are the daily realities with which people with haemophilia live. The history of the manner in which the State has dealt with them goes as far back as the fall of the Fianna Fáil Government under Charles J. Haughey over the refusal to compensate people for basic living requirements. It has taken until now, many years and many deaths later, for the tribunal's terms of reference to be published.</P>
    <P>It is important that the correct decisions are made this time. We know now that the terms of reference of the Finlay tribunal of inquiry were flawed because they failed to encapsulate investigation of the circumstances of infection of people with haemophilia with hepatitis C. The Irish Haemophilia Society was forced to walk out of that inquiry and an assurance was given by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, that this tribunal of inquiry would be established in recognition of the needs of the society's members. We must be certain that this tribunal achieves what it sets out to do and that its recommendations, when made, are acted upon. That principle must apply regardless of how difficult the task may be.</P>
    <P>The legal difficulties which made the Department of Health loath to include in the terms of reference any investigation of pharmaceutical companies based in the US which manufactured most of the blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs are understood generally. The Minister has allowed for this investigation in the terms of reference but only as far as is &ldquo;practicable, appropriate and reasonable and without undue delaying of the completion of the <Col N="1443" /> inquiry&rdquo;. It is vital that this caveat does not mean any lack of aggressive investigation of the international dimension. Finding the truth will require resolute analysis of products which came into the country and, if necessary, will require legal action to obtain evidence as to their origins. We are all agreed that the tribunal of inquiry should not incur unnecessary delays and, for very understandable reasons, the families want it to complete its work within a reasonable time. That said, the tribunal must not give up easily in discovering the truth about all aspects of this disaster, including the international one.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind what happened when Canadian haemophiliacs sought investigation into the export of tainted blood plasma from Arkansas and Louisiana in the 1980s. The Krever Commission, set up in Canada in 1995, found that much of the tainted plasma came from Cummins prison in Arkansas. The inmates' blood was sold to a company called Health Management Associates which ran the prison plasma programme until 1994, the very existence of which was denied by prison officials and the sales from which were barred from the domestic market by the FDA because they were not found to be safe. Interestingly, Mr. Bill Clinton was Governor of Arkansas at the time. The blood products were, however, sold throughout the world, perhaps even here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Cummins prison even when the existence of AIDS and hepatitis C was recognised and tests for them became available they were not always used. The FDA discovered that one hepatitis testing laboratory was out of action for two months. Needles were often dirty and many inmates now claim to have been infected as they gave blood. In the early 1980s, the centre was accused of numerous violations and ordered to close temporarily, but the company in the prison continued to sell blood, especially to a company called Connaught, a Canadian company that is under investigation as to whether it sold this plasma world-wide. Canadian haemophiliacs have already taken legal action against the Canadian government and the companies involved, and they are now setting about filing a law suit against the state of Arkansas and Louisiana, their prison systems and even the FDA. We should not be any less diligent. Tracing the infection, the links in that chain and tracing responsibility is a central part of the tribunal's work. I look to the tribunal to pursue this international aspect with vigour.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it would be helpful if the Minister would state publicly &ndash; he may reply at the end of this debate &ndash; that all documentation in his Department will be made available to people with haemophilia and their representative body. I ask that he give a similar commitment on disclosure by the BTSB. Already the experience has been that documentation has not been released by the BTSB to the Irish Haemophilia Society despite the welcome declarations from the BTSB of a new openness and accountability. The prac<Col N="1444" /> tice contradicts that declaration and the Minister should state publicly his view on that.</P>
    <P>In terms of any recommendations arising from the report, it is worth noting that despite the Government commitment in its programme for Government to fully implement the Finlay report, two of its recommendations have not yet been implemented. Mr. Justice Finlay recommended that the law be changed to oblige doctors to report adverse reactions to blood products. Instead of this necessary and practical form of mandatory reporting, the Government has opted for a voluntary code which is not what was recommended. He also recommended the establishment of a blood service users council, a good, unambiguous provision, yet the Government wriggled out of this by not delivering on this other crucial recommendation. I believe the Minister intends to ensure &ndash; but he needs to state this publicly &ndash; that the inquiry is efficient, fair and, most importantly, effective and that recommendations made will be delivered upon.</P>
    <P>Since compensation is an important part of the negotiations held with the Irish Haemophilia Society, I ask the Minister to tell us also if the State intends to appeal the recent court decision to award £100,000 to a victim of hepatitis C who chose to go the court route. Obviously this has implications in terms of compensation.</P>
    <P>When we consider what has happened to people living with haemophilia, the heartbreak experienced by them in these circumstances can only be imagined. None of us can know precisely what it is like unless we have experienced it ourselves. That experience has often been compounded, however, by mishandling and inadequacy within the health services. One parent I spoke to told me that his two children were diagnosed as having hepatitis C two years before he and his wife were informed of the fact. It is incredible that this should have happened, but it did and the information was given in a way that was casual and very unsatisfactory. He was told on his own. The normal support and counselling one would expect was not made available to the couple. He described it as follows:</P>
    <P>I felt angry at what had happened to my children, that was bad. But I felt even more angry at the way I was told, the delay [of two years] in telling us and even then at the lack of support and counselling.</P>
    <P>It is inexcusable and inexplicable that any family should have suffered so much, but it happened and it is on the record.</P>
    <P>After a period in excess of two years of protracted and detailed negotiations on the terms of reference for this inquiry, we all hope that the tribunal will be established with all possible speed. I urge the Minister to specify the start-up date in his reply, and recognise that there is an urgency to have evidence that the tribunal is functioning, and that such evidence be manifest at an early date. It is important that the weakest, most endangered and vulnerable people in these tragic <Col N="1445" /> events get answers to the issues of crucial public importance to be investigated by this tribunal.</P>
    <P>We are living in a new era of openness and we recognise that makes demands on our administrative system, but they are demands that must be met. Dark secrets are being revealed to us, painful and important secrets. None have caused more suffering than secrets around the issue of viral infection of people with haemophilia. They need to know that each of our citizens has a right to know why circumstances occurred to cause a national catastrophe of the scale of infection we have seen and that we must never see again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the resolution before the House. Few issues in Ireland in the recent past have given rise to such legitimate concern and disquiet among the public generally and among those unfortunate to have been touched by this tragedy than the infection of people with haemophilia with hepatitis C and HIV. We have a duty to ensure that a thorough and detailed investigation is carried out and that the results are made public. This is at the request not just of the Irish Haemophilia Society but of the public who are demanding that answers be given to people unfortunate enough to be infected in this way.</P>
      <P>This inquiry has been established because people are entitled to expect that a State institution such as the Blood Transfusion Service Board is in a position to protect them, and that the Department of Health will protect them also. In this instance, people relied on the institutions of the State and they were let down. We need to know why and we need to ensure that something like this cannot recur.</P>
      <P>This matter is a proper one for a tribunal of inquiry. I regret, however, that the only legislative path available to this House is the path provided by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. Despite the many amendments made to this Act over the years, it is an inefficient, outdated and unsuited statute which is unable to permit an inquiry to be efficiently conducted. With hindsight, it would have been better for this House to have introduced a new modern statute setting out the powers of an inquiry. The 1921 Act was passed at a time when our Constitution was unwritten and when the legal concept of fair procedures as we now know it was wholly undeveloped.</P>
      <P>The imposition of a constitutional superstructure on an antiquated Westminster statute has created a model for chaos which virtually guarantees friction between those being investigated and those conducting the inquiry. I hope such friction can be avoided in this instance and that this tribunal can avoid the mistakes made elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wholesale uncertainty as regards the scale and extent of the powers of a tribunal of inquiry, and the manner and circumstances in which these powers can be exercised, will cause difficulties for this tribunal. I hope it will be able to overcome those difficulties, but the absence of any coherent statutory guidance from the Oireachtas as to the <Col N="1446" /> extent of the powers a tribunal may exercise and the manner in which those powers may be exercised has resulted in virtually constant resort to the courts by persons involved with tribunals. To date, tribunals have not faired well in defending the powers they thought they had or the manner in which they have sought to exercise them. Each such excursion to the courts is a costly exercise to the taxpayers. The time has long since passed when this House should have introduced a modern statute, and I hope this will be the last tribunal established under the 1921 Act.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that a tribunal is set up to inquire into matters of definite public importance and to report to the Oireachtas to assist us in discharging our legislative task. We need to know what happened, and when and why it happened in order to take whatever legislative or administrative steps are necessary to ensure that this can never happen again.</P>
    <P>The fact that the findings of the tribunal are of no legal consequence does not take from their importance. This tribunal is long overdue. I welcome the fact that the Irish Haemophilia Society is satisfied with the tribunal's terms of reference and that full consultation took place with the society before this motion was presented to the House. The IHS feels that the compensation to date has been inadequate in dealing with its claims and I look forward to the negotiations which will take place between the Department and the society to ensure that fair and equitable compensation is made available to sufferers.</P>
    <P>The terms of the motion and the tribunal will investigate all those who had responsibility for this matter. In particular, it will examine the criteria, standards and procedures adopted by the BTSB concerning all matters, particularly donor selection, screening and testing, and the board's use of products manufactured abroad or in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Accountability is the key word in investigating and establishing a tribunal. Everyone involved must be held to account. We need to know, as the terms of reference have established, when the information became available, when the various bodies received the relevant knowledge, and what action was taken, not only to reduce or minimise the risk of infection, but also to identify and notify those likely to have been infected. Reports that some time lapsed before these people were notified makes this case more sorrowful and horrific.</P>
    <P>The fact that the House is asking the tribunal to investigate the role of the Minister, the Department and the National Drugs Advisory Board in carrying out their functions, shows that it is not afraid to investigate its affairs and those of people directly associated with it. Other institutions in the State might look at this example in light of recent events.</P>
    <P>We are considering events which took place about 15 years ago and we have to accept that knowledge has grown, practices have changed <Col N="1447" /> and science and medicine have advanced. Therefore, it is particularly important that the tribunal's terms of reference stipulate that it must have regard to what existed at the time these events occurred. Whatever happens, the privacy and anonymity of the haemophiliacs and their families must be protected, if that is their desire.</P>
    <P>The motion asks that the tribunal should be efficient and economical. I do not know if the word &ldquo;economical&rdquo; applies to any tribunals to date. However it goes about its work, I hope the tribunal's report, although of no legal consequence, will at least provide the information to the public; provide some consolation for the sufferers who have been waiting for answers for 15 years; and give guidance to those with responsibility for these areas so that we avoid future disasters involving the health and lives of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Shatter, McManus and Hanafin for their contributions to this motion. It is important to note that the House is unanimous in the context of this motion and I am grateful to the Deputies for their support. The motion meets the requirements, in so far as we can gauge them, of those who have made inquiries about these matters and who are satisfied and supportive of the approach being adopted by the Government.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister, I have been particularly mindful to ensure that we have a full process of consultation and periods of reflection on the issues raised in seeking to produce terms of reference which are workable and which meet the objectives of those concerned. Given the public interest requirement concerning disclosure of facts, it is important that we successfully address these issues and do not end up with a situation in which the tribunal cannot report because of its terms of reference. This must be understood when reflecting on the time given to this issue.</P>
      <P>In January 1997 the previous Government indicated that it agreed in principle with setting up a tribunal of inquiry. The Finlay tribunal was still sitting at that time and was the focus of attention. Therefore, virtually no work was done on this matter until the change of Government in July 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Irish Haemophilia Society in September for the purpose of beginning a process which has taken 18 months to come before the House. The previous Government did not give a commitment to address the separate issue of fair and equitable compensation. It is important to point out that, at a meeting on 23 February 1999, the Government noted the Irish Haemophilia Society's concerns in relation to its perception of the inadequacy of the compensation available for persons with haemophilia infected with HIV or hepatitis C; affirmed its commitment to fair and equitable compensation for such persons; and asked me, following detailed discussions with the society, to revert to Government with proposals <Col N="1448" /> to address any inadequacy in the current compensation arrangements in a fair and equitable manner. This is a separate matter which those involved wish to see dealt with separately. For that reason we will be in a position to proceed with discussions on that matter following the adoption of this motion by the Oireachtas and the setting up of the tribunal into the substantive issues of concern to them.</P>
    <P>The IHS submitted a number of documents detailing its views on the compensation issue, including its views on perceived anomalies in the present hepatitis C compensation tribunal as it applies to persons with haemophilia who are co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV. At a meeting with the society on 21 May 1999 I agreed that, when this motion had been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, discussions relating to compensation would commence between the society and the Department. That is an agreed position between us on that separate matter.</P>
    <P>As regards recent events there has been a perception that there was delay or a spurt of activity at the last moment. As I stated publicly at the time, we had reached a situation where 95 per cent of the work had been completed. There was one issue to be addressed and the most up to date draft terms of reference had been communicated to the IHS. I did not believe then and I do not believe now that there was reticence on the part of the Department or the Government to deal with this matter. When we received the final draft from the draftsman, which people were told would be produced the following week, we were able to arrange a meeting on the Friday morning between the Attorney General, myself, Department officials and the IHS to go through the issues in some detail. That confirms that work was very much advanced and that we were at the final stages of coming forward with the motion which is now before the House. This must be said to address the perception or presentation that suddenly everything was done in a week. That was not the case.</P>
    <P>The complexity of the issues involved, particularly the jurisdictional issue of setting up a tribunal to investigate matters that occurred outside the State, was recognised by Members who contributed to this debate. Anybody with a cursory knowledge of the law would know that there were complex legal matters involved in arranging to meet the objectives of victims, as I have always sought to do, who wanted an international dimension to the inquiry. There was a requirement for people to get independent advice and, if they wished, to make their own inquiries in those jurisdictions as to how we might be able to secure the maximum possible amount of information which could be considered by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, our work on that specific issue has been conducted by working openly with the people concerned. Counsel for the State, counsel for the Department and counsel for the society met on a number of occasions to discuss these issues at length. It should be <Col N="1449" /> emphasised that there was an open, co-operative process involved in ensuring everybody understood the situation, the essence of the issues which had to be addressed, the fact that they could not be fudged and that there was an obligation to arrive at a workable solution.</P>
    <P>Given the public statements by the Irish Haemophilia Society, I believe it is supportive of these terms of reference as the best possible formula to provide for a workable, timely and efficient tribunal to address these issues as speedily as possible. I am grateful to everybody in the Department and in the Office of Attorney General, to the Attorney General himself and to the people I have met in relation to this issue for the work they have done, their constructive approach and their bona fides in trying to arrive at a solution that meets the requirements of the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter inquired about the timescale. I expect public hearings of the tribunal to commence in the autumn. However, I hope that when the chairperson is nominated by Government, he or she will be able to begin reading into the brief, assembling a legal team and contacting relevant bodies and persons. I hope as much preparatory work as possible is completed during the summer and early autumn so public hearings can commence in the autumn. I am currently involved in discussions with the Attorney General with regard to the selection of a suitable person to chair the tribunal. Subject to Government approval, I hope to announce the name of the chairperson at an early date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the issue of contacts with pharmaceutical companies. Some inquiries would have been made of the Department but, obviously, until terms of reference were agreed and the parameters of what would be involved could be completed, there was a need to ensure we did not, in any sense, compromise or create a perception of compromising ourselves or our position. One must also be mindful of the fact that civil actions are being taken by individuals against the same companies. It was important, therefore, that the Department was seen to act in a way in which nobody could suggest the public interest was being compromised or that there was negotiation taking place with people who will have to come before the tribunal or with people whose representatives reside in this State. Whatever action the tribunal chairperson may take to trigger the international dimension as set out in the terms of reference will be a matter for the tribunal chairperson in due course.</P>
    <P>I was extremely anxious to maintain the integrity of our position in terms of the Department pursuing the formulation of terms of reference which were objectively required to meet the circumstances of the case. For that reason, I was not involved in discussions with pharmaceutical companies on the issue, although they indicated what their concerns might be in written correspondence from legal representatives to the Department. However, no work has been done by the Department with the pharmaceutical companies. <Col N="1450" /> That can now take place under the aegis of the tribunal with the terms of reference established.</P>
    <P>That was the more prudent way to proceed to avoid misconception or misrepresentation of anybody's position, although I acknowledge the argument put forward by the Deputy is made in a helpful and constructive manner. In all the circumstances of this case, however, it would not be a prudent course to adopt. It should now be left to the tribunal chairperson and his or her team to pursue it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter also raised the matter of medical assessors in terms of their being of assistance to the chairperson, given that extremely technical issues are involved. While this is primarily a matter for the tribunal, there can be considerable advantages in the tribunal having access to one or more medical expert to assist in its work. This is a matter I intend to discuss with the chairperson in due course in the context of the <i>modus operandi </i>of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, there has been limited contact between the Department and solicitors acting for one of the pharmaceutical companies. However, these contacts related to requests from the company for advance information on the terms of reference rather than the matters raised by Deputy Shatter. It would not have been possible for the Department to enter into consultations with the companies until the terms of reference had been settled and, in particular, the extent to which the companies would be investigated became clear. It is only within the past two weeks or so that the position in relation to the terms of reference and the role of the companies has been clarified. Given that the tribunal is about to be appointed, it would be more appropriate for the tribunal itself to deal with the companies rather than the Department getting involved in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the issue of establishing a new criminal offence where public bodies, or persons working on behalf of public bodies or authorised to work on their behalf, act in a way that is reckless and, on the evidence, criminal. I listened to his argument for the need to strengthen criminal law in relation to negligent acts by public bodies and their staff, but the Deputy will appreciate that it is a broader issue which will impact on all public services, not just the health services. I understand the Law Reform Commission has given preliminary consideration to the matter in one of its recent reports. It can be followed up by the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1451" /> Equality and Law Reform with regard to the overall policy issues it raises.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus raised the question of the availability of documentation from the Department for the society. That documentation is being assembled in preparation for the tribunal and we have no problem with what is, effectively, a voluntary discovery process to allow the IHS or its representatives look at any documentation which will be forwarded to the tribunal in due course. The BTSB has granted solicitors for the IHS substantial access to its files and documentation over the past few months. I understand there was a reluctance on the part of the BTSB to allow copies of documents to be removed from the offices of its solicitors until the terms of reference were known. Now that the terms of reference are available, I hope the IHS and the BTSB can reach agreement on that matter. The Department has given a commitment to facilitate inspection by the IHS solicitors as soon as the material has been catalogued.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus raised the recent High Court hepatitis C appeal case in which an award of £150,000 in general damages by the tribunal was increased to £250,000. Media comment at the time indicated that the tribunal had been operating a cap of £150,000 for general damages. Since the judgment, my Department has been informed by the tribunal that it did not operate such a cap and that it had made awards of up to £250,000 in general damages in other cases where it felt that was warranted. I do not expect the High Court judgment to have implications for all the cases dealt with by the tribunal, and I understand senior counsel for Positive Action takes a similar view.</P>

      <P>No. Deputy Hanafin's interesting contribution raised the fundamental issue of the need for a more modern framework other than the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to deal with matters of public importance. That is a salient point with which I believe the public would agree. One issue is fair procedures, which is a considerable legal issue in the context of drafting terms of reference to allow matters under inquiry to be efficaciously and comprehensively addressed. We usually seek to establish tribunals where they relate to matters of public importance which have wide ramifications. Given the build up of constitutional and administrative law, it is an issue which needs to be addressed as a policy matter because we do not want a situation where the investigation of matters of public importance, where it is warranted, gets a bad name because of what are seen to be lengthy and distracting appeals to the courts which, while it is the entitlement of any citizen to take them, as far as the public is concerned, are seen to draw out the issues under investigation by a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> It is a fair point to make that the 1921 Act is a creature of the Westminster Parliament and predates the constitutional superstructure imposed under the 1922 and 1937 Constitutions. That it was enacted when we did not have a written Constitution means we should not be surprised that problems arise. There is a need for a modern statutory framework where it is deemed to be in the national interest to have tribunals to examine matters of public importance. Given the level of State and public involvement in national affairs and the sophistication of national life compared to 70 or 80 years ago, a fair point can be made that that review should be undertaken in policy terms.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies. It is my objective that Members, in recognition of the issues which must be addressed, would be united in addressing these matters of public importance in an uncontentious way while at the same time ensuring proper issues are raised for which we would be accountable and which we would have to explain. I am glad it is in that atmosphere we have been able to approach these issues, mindful of the victims and their families, the fact that these people have a difficult clinical condition, that they want to see these issues addressed comprehensively and as quickly as possible and that they want to see the Dáil, the Seanad and the tribunal, when established, handling them in a sensitive and comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to the need to address the issues aggressively. What is important is that the issues be addressed comprehensively and in a manner which respects fair procedures and ensures the terms of reference we adopt allow us to get to the root of the issues and obtain as much knowledge and explanation of the context in which decisions were taken and where responsibility lies. To that end, chairpersons of calibre are available to us through the judicial process and the Judiciary generally who can forensically examine these matters and report to us in a comprehensible and explicable fashion.</P>
    <P>The immediate issue is to finalise discussions with the Attorney General on the appointment of a chairperson. We will seek a person who will meet everyone's approval as a person of experience and someone with the competence to deal with these issues. A number of likely candidates are available to us. The discussions must be completed before we can make an announcement, but I intend to complete them as quickly as possible. I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak in support of the Bill which is timely and <Col N="1453" /> warranted legislation. The Minister dealt with the pace of change in broadcasting and the changes in sport, especially in sports coverage. She gave a firm commitment that there would be significant consultation with the public, organisers, administrators and volunteers involved in sport before any event is designated or listed. I welcome that because it is very important.</P>
      <P>We may praise it or curse it, but television has become an integral part of our lives as individuals and as a society. The world around us may be shaped or our concepts of reality can be based on what comes down the television tube. The worst horrors of famine and war can be banished with the flick of a switch. Television has helped us travel the world and see distant countries without leaving our armchairs and without the discomfort of travel which affects some people. We may think we have been to those places and that the impressions contained in an hour long documentary are the totality.</P>
      <P>Many of those involved in development aid, disaster relief or conflict resolution refer to a pervasive phenomenon called &ldquo;CNN syndrome&rdquo;. For a week or two, the world's television cameras focus the world's collective attention on a catastrophe, war or famine. After a while, the camera crews are called away, at times to cover a similar event elsewhere. The original story fades and people believe the lack of coverage somehow reflects a resolution and an end to the tragedy which brought the cameras there in the first place, whereas those on the ground know the tragedy continues. It is often the logistics of a far away and largely insensitive television company which have dictated the removal of the story from the world's sitting rooms. Television is able to mould reality and its powers are immense. It is hardly surprising that every authoritarian regime holds its television service in an iron grip with dedicated men ensuring the official line is hammered home at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>Until the late 1980s, television was organised on a national basis. Each state had its national broadcaster with one, two or three channels. Its coverage was limited to the borders of the state. There probably was not ever a serious attempt to broadcast far beyond the national frontier to people speaking a different language. The advent of satellite broadcasting changed this landscape. The national broadcasters were now challenged by media such as Turner Television and Sky, whose broadcasts were no longer restricted by borders. The potential viewing audience was no longer a nation state but the world. Some traditional broadcasters have responded to this challenge, most noticeably the BBC through its world service television network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further technological advance is now upon to us with the advent of digital television. There was a time when house prices were influenced by whether a property was in receipt of two or three television channels instead of one. People living in the Border area had the advantage of being able to receive BBC, UTV and RTE. Most of <Col N="1454" /> those who subscribe to cable television can now access at least 20 channels, but digital television will offer a multiplicity of channels from the outset.</P>
    <P>Large international satellite broadcasters have revolutionised television and many aspects of traditional terrestrial broadcasting. This is true of areas such as news gathering where the concept of &ldquo;as it happens&rdquo; reportage means that those who cannot wait for their evening dose of news can have a 24 hour supply. This has helped to make the world a smaller place which is not a bad thing, but it is only part of the story.</P>
    <P>The world of broadcasting is driven as never before by commercial imperatives. Few of the large satellite television companies are bound by a commitment to serve the social needs of the countries they service, beyond perhaps some bland and meaningless mission statement. However, such organisations seem to have very deep purses which has encouraged the practice of cherry-picking where the rights for broadcasting events, particularly though not exclusively in the sporting world, are bought by satellite television companies. Consequently, access to their broadcasts is not always free to those who desire it &ndash; expensive equipment, such as satellite dishes and decoders, must be installed and fees and tariffs for viewing must be paid. Lifelong fans who want to follow their sport are obliged to pay large amounts to watch their favourite games. Satellite television viewing is beyond the reach of many people whose financial resources way be subject to other, more pressing demands.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the commercialisation of sport. Sports events are costly and sports stars look for huge pay cheques. The impact of the practice of cherry-picking on sport in England has often been devastating for ordinary fans. In certain sports, a fence of high costs has been erected for viewers and those who do not possess satellite dishes have to make do with bare snippets of the day's play on the evening news. Each screen displays in its corner the name and logo of the satellite company with exclusive rights to the event in question which has supplied very little detail to a terrestrial broadcaster for a huge sum.</P>
    <P>There are some who would say that we are alarmist to think that this could happen in Ireland. People cannot deny that Ireland plays host to important sporting events with an international following, whether it be showjumping, golf or rugby. However, the danger also exists for Gaelic games which have a huge following not only in this country but also among Irish exiles in England, America and Australia. Many of these people are well off and can afford satellite reception equipment. They may be far from home but their local pride is undiminished by distance and they represent a perfect opportunity for satellite television companies.</P>
    <P>The commercialisation of sport in Ireland is a new development. Sports of all kinds in this country have always been organised on an amateur basis, though this never implied that individuals <Col N="1455" /> or teams gave anything less than 100 per cent of their talent and skill. We are proud that some of our sports stars have been able to join the world of the professionals and reap whatever rewards are on offer. However, we must never forget that the vast majority of sportsmen and women, in common with their forebears, are part-timers and must seek their living in areas away from the sports field. This is a very important part of our culture and it is an aspect of sporting activity that is alien to the international broadcasting companies which are more accustomed to purely professional sports.</P>
    <P>Terrestrial broadcasters such as RTE, BBC and UTV have done a very good job in recent years in ensuring that those who cannot attend sporting fixtures in person are able to sense some of the excitement, albeit at long distance. There has been a welcome increase in coverage of provincial championship games, particularly in Ulster, by RTE, UTV and the BBC. For over 60 years these stations have offered people a choice. In the 1930s few people owned cars but there were those who would give us every means possible to attend a sporting fixture if their team was taking part. This was especially true of Gaelic football when the appearance of a team in the All-Ireland finals brought people to Dublin from the furthest recesses of Clare, Mayo, Kerry and Cavan &ndash; in the past my county's team used to appear in Croke Park on a regular basis. For those who did not have the energy to travel, coverage was provided on radio. Receivers were expensive to buy and just as expensive to run. However, those who were fortunate enough to own such an advanced piece of technology would throw their homes open to those wanting to listen to a match.</P>
    <P>Things have come a long way from the first occasion on which Cavan took part in an All &ndash; Ireland championship in 1933. However, the choice between attending a sports fixture in person or participating from afar still remains. Increased car ownership means that the decision not to attend may be caused by a wish to avoid either traffic congestion or the good brisk walk necessary to get from the parking space to the sports field. Some people &ndash; I am not one of them &ndash; enjoy their favourite sport in a weatherproof environment. The armchair experts obtain all the answers courtesy of the strategic location of television cameras.</P>
    <P>We take free television coverage of major sporting fixtures for granted. Thanks to this legislation and the Minister's work in this area, we will be able to take it for granted for a long time to come. The growth of satellite television causes understandable worries but it is a fact of life with which we must come to terms, facing potential dangers boldly and courageously and using legislation to protect our national interests, paramount among which is the well-being of our people.</P>
    <P>The Major Events Television Coverage Bill will give the Minister for Arts, Culture, Gaeltacht <Col N="1456" /> and the Islands the power to protect designated events considered to be of major importance to society. The decision with regard to which events to designate will be taken after consultations with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation as well as representatives of all others involved in an event, including venue owners, events promoters, sporting organisations, players and supporters, media organisations and broadcasters. The process will be at all times transparent because the Minister will notify the public of her intentions to designate an event before a ministerial order is made.</P>
    <P>Once an event has been designated, it will acquire immense protection from potential poaching or cherry-picking. Such an event can then only be covered by a terrestrial broadcaster, relying on traditional diffusion methods such as land-based transmitters and cables. Furthermore, such a broadcaster must provide a free television service, charging no access fee for reception of their programmes to at least 85 per cent of the population of the country. The requisite coverage for qualification will rise to 95 per cent at the end of the year 2001. This is not a restrictive clause because the definition of the term &ldquo;broadcaster&rdquo; is not confined to single entities. Therefore, a number of broadcasters, even of quite a small scale, whose combined free-to-air coverage meets the required percentage, can qualify to provide coverage of a designated event.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that the intention of the legislation is to protect, not to shut out media organisations from covering any event or to dissuade interest in any event in this country because to do so would be short-sighted and unjust. We have had a long enough struggle to assert our identity in the world. Those who have helped do so are our sports men and women who have been ambassadors for many years. We cannot afford to be seen as hostile or to vainly ignore the legitimate interests of the international media. The Bill contains stipulations requiring those broadcasters who are granted the right to cover an event to make access available to all interested parties at acceptable market rates.</P>
    <P>Some sports have a greater following outside Ireland, although the ups and downs of sporting fads can be short-lived. One such sport is cycling. In the heyday of the 1980s, when Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly were the leaders in world cycling, the sport had a major support base here. While cycling is still popular, particularly for recreational purposes, it does not enjoy the same near fanaticism it enjoys in France, Belgium or Italy. There is a danger that if a major sporting event with a small Irish following but with a mass following elsewhere was scheduled in Ireland, a claim that it should be designated because of its major importance to our society might be hard to justify. This Bill provides adequate protection. It incorporates the recent EU Television without Frontiers Directive, which prohibits any Irish based media company from trying to poach <Col N="1457" /> coverage of an event from a terrestrial broadcaster in another country.</P>
    <P>Much of the discussion on the Bill and the designating powers it will grant to the Minister has centred on the protection it will afford sporting events. However, we must remember that these are not the only events which can be considered as being of major importance to society. We must think of the protection for live concerts by Irish rock bands, because pop music is yet another field where terrestrial broadcasters are under pressure from satellite channels. There is also the possibility that classical music concerts may have to be designated, because some classical performers have attained near rock star status and attract huge sales. I hope such success will also arrive for our traditional musicians, although it has arrived for some of them abroad. Surely such events, particularly when they embrace Irish artists, can be considered as being of major importance to society.</P>
    <P>All those involved in events in Ireland can feel safe as a result of this legislation. It will grant us the power to look after important aspects of our culture. At times there is a tendency to see culture as being static, yet major sporting and musical events are as integral to our culture as any novel, manuscript or historical site. We have a consequent duty to protect them and that is what this legislation does. As a result, we can be assured there will not come a September when coverage of an all-Ireland hurling or football final will not be available to all of us. I congratulate the Minister on introducing this progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced this legislation after a lengthy period of reflection. Members will recall that Deputy Michael Higgins introduced a Private Members' Bill some time ago and, while it was rejected by the Government, it contained many of the ideas in this legislation. Deputy Michael Higgins recognised that immediate advances in television technology meant that designated events needed to be protected urgently.</P>
      <P>We have experienced a growth in coverage of sporting events from all over the world as a result of advances in technology. More is now known about American sports as people spend time watching a batsman attempting to break a world record in baseball or a player playing for high fees in the Super Bowl. I agree it is necessary to designate particular events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned that the media is dominated by the American production of films. Films are being broadcast by the partnerships which have been developed between Sky and other major television networks in the United States. This is a great commercial advantage for stations. Every trick is used to publicise the products the people need to sell. We are small fry when it comes to publicity. The real value of &ldquo;megasports&rdquo;, such as soccer, was illustrated by the attempt to take over Manchester United and other UK clubs. <Col N="1458" /> However, that has been parried for the time being by the British Government. I have no doubt that media corporations will try again to make such large investments. This legislation is, therefore, timely.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider using the Oireachtas committee system to consult our major sporting organisations. This would give them the opportunity to air their views and the relevant committee could then inform the Minister. We have already examined digital broadcasting and all the problems which might arise for public service broadcasting in particular. That analysis and the submissions made by the various groups to the committee were informative. It might help the Minister in her current dilemma.</P>
    <P>The GAA is a voluntary organisation which wants to expand its infrastructure and to provide the best facilities. It would be loath to pass on a major advertising opportunity by designating its major events as free-to-air. One often reads in the national newspapers about major television corporations approaching the GAA with a view to signing a contract. I know RTE has had keen competition from other media organisations when the time came for the GAA to renew its yearly programme. I was involved in a voluntary organisation and am aware that the demands today are so great that it is very difficult to continually raise money for capital infrastructure. When people are in a position to earn money through advertising, they should be given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>In the beginning I thought listing designated events, such as the all-Ireland championships, would be simplistic but it was not until the arrival of my county, Clare, on the hurling scene that I saw the value of live coverage of the hurling championship from Sunday to Sunday. It is of great benefit to people at home, particularly the elderly, to have free access to such events. The leaders of these by and large amateur organisations will have some difficulty in implementing the Minister's ruling fully. That is why I offer the Minister the opportunity to use the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language for the public consultation process. It would be a better medium of debate and enhance the committee ideal.</P>
    <P>Much of this work was undertaken after the Television Without Frontiers Directive, 1997, had been implemented. However, the Commission has been slow to identify all the issues and the meeting in Greece moved the process forward by producing a list that had already been drawn up in 1997. The Commission is being lax on this matter. I am surprised that other countries, which were vocal, particularly about public service broadcasting, at conferences held during the Irish Presidency of the EU seem to have gone to sleep since. People were concerned that the cultural and social life of Europe would receive priority on television channels and that this should happen when designating events. I do not understand why the Commission has been lax on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> I am glad there will be a European Council meeting in Helsinki in 1999, but, nevertheless, three years have been wasted by not drawing up the necessary legislation to deal with this issue. A list of major events are held annually, such as the Grand National, the Aga Khan Trophy, international rugby and soccer matches, international swimming and the Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>However, there must be a certain amount of North-South co-operation for this to work. The Minister did not reflect on such co-operation in her contribution. Northern Ireland began to develop the multi-channel format first and this is how Irish people got their appetite for other sports, traditional music and pop music concerts. Public service channels there had a greater interest in these aspects of the culture of the island. What is the position on North-South co-operation in regard to television channels? What agreement could be reached following the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    <P>Social, cultural and recreational events play an important role in society and they were of great benefit to the country when unemployment was high. People found that their involvement in sport was valuable to them in terms of their health. The ESRI recommended 3 per cent capital investment in social, cultural and recreational infrastructure as part of the national plan over the coming years. That involves a risk but there is a great need for such investment and I am glad that major organisations, such as the GAA and the FAI, are improving their facilities on a daily basis. That is why there must be balance in designating events and I ask the Minister to be sensitive about that when she draws up her list.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisers of sport have a difficult time trying to continually raise money. The State has a role to play both in capital investment and the way it assists such organisations. Sports organisations must also have an opportunity to raise additional funds themselves in order to progress and there should be a sensible approach to the issue. The Bill is timely and the quicker the issue is progressed the better. If the Minister wants to avail of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language for the public consultation process, she is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well with it. I am not well briefed on it but I am aware of what it proposes to do and that the Minister is a major fan of social and cultural events. She should listen to the good advice of my colleagues, Deputies Kenny and Carey. Deputy Carey has been advising her for many years on different aspects of broadcasting and politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that major sporting, cultural and social events are exempted from paid transmission by Sky and other broadcasting corporations which are trying to take over the running of these events throughout the world. There are a number of <Col N="1460" /> Irish events which are of national and international importance and should be considered by this Bill. The GAA, FAI and IRFU stage events which have an international dimension. Those events have been part of Irish culture and society for many years and should be guarded against broadcasting organisations seeking to impose pay per view conditions on their transmission. I refer to events such as the All-Ireland intercounty and club finals.</P>
    <P>Athletics is another area that should be considered. The World Cross Country Championships have been run in this country before and no doubt will be run here again. This legislation should address the possibility of broadcasting companies trying to buy that event.</P>
    <P>I watched Sky television last week and was surprised to see &ldquo;Don't Feed The Gondolas&rdquo;, a late night satirical programme on RTE presented by Sean Moncrieff. I presume Sky bought the rights from RTE. The Minister should look at this matter. Mr. Moncrieff was a classmate of mine and has done excellent work in broadcasting, but when I saw him on an international channel I felt the next thing one might see would be &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; on a German channel. It might be in the Minster's interest to have &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; covered by the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is hugely important because we are such a sports-minded race. We do not just participate but we watch sports at great length. It would be very difficult for the general public to accept that money can dictate what can or cannot be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have very limited television reception. Ms Etain Doyle, the telecommunications regulator, has promised for some time to license deflector systems and to provide an acceptable system to people all over the country. However, that is not how things stand. Huge numbers of people in rural Ireland can only receive RTE 1, Network 2, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3. Many of them cannot receive BBC or ITV let alone the Sky or paid channels. This country is divided when it comes to television reception. Those in the pale and on the east coast have <Col N="1461" /> access to all the channels through Cablelink or other systems by virtue of their geographic location. Those in the south and west, however, are cut off. If they do not have a Cablelink system in their immediate area, such as in a large town, they are confined to a few channels. It is imperative that something is done for them.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the European Commission has huge powers in this area. I had come to the conclusion long ago that money spoke for everything and everybody. I am glad to see that Sky cannot dominate the air waves. The Council of Ministers, of which the Minister is a member, and the Commission have the final say and that is reassuring.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there has been a revolution in watching sport. Some of the coverage is very welcome while more of it leaves us indifferent. The poor women of Ireland, the Minister's colleagues, must be bored out of their minds at having to watch football, cricket and snooker. However, women tell me that many of them enjoy snooker and have a particular affinity for studying the backsides of some of the world's famous snooker players. It is amazing what attracts people. Men are often accused of being chauvinists but it can be attributed to both sexes.</P>
    <P>Women suffer from the fact that television is dominated to a large degree by sports coverage, whether that is coverage of Irish sport or on the British or Sky channels. If there is a male sporting fanatic in a house, women suffer. That is a fact of life. That is the down side to the huge coverage of sport, though some of the sports carry their own downsides.

Some of my colleagues are golfers and that game can be compulsive viewing if one watches it for a while. It is certainly not conducive to happy relationships in a household if one person dominates the channels.</P>
      <P>Sport reflects the mentality of a nation. Continental Europeans are fascinated by motor racing and tennis, while we regard those sports as exceptionally boring. Because of our history of nationalism, we prefer what I call blood sports. Not everyone would describe Gaelic football or rugby as blood sports, but I do and anyone who watched last Sunday's Munster championship hurling match between Waterford and Limerick will know what I mean. One could almost hear the bones breaking, feel the flesh bruising and see the blood spilling.</P>

      <P>It is good to know that pay channels will not have a monopoly of sports broadcasting. With limited resources, RTE has done an excellent job in promoting sports, particularly Gaelic games. I am not an advocate of Gaelic football. The sport has seen better days and has declined since the days of the great Kerry team of the 1970s and 1980s. I hope the sport is not dying out, but it is not as popular as it once was. Television has given hurling an enormous fillip. This is the uniquely Irish game which dates back to the days of Cú Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhail. The Scots game of shinty is merely a derivative of hurling. Live televising of hurling games has boosted the sport tremendously. People from non-hurling areas have become addicted to it. It is a fearsome game that requires great skill and it is wonderful to see it promoted on RTE.</P>
      <P>Australian rules football, which is closely allied to Gaelic football, is being promoted on one of the Sky pay channels. While tearing and dragging has diminished Gaelic football and has caused it to lose its popularity with spectators, Australian rules football is now a finer spectacle. If Sky finds it profitable to promote Australian rules football on a pay channel, it might only be a matter of time before the company expresses an interest in broadcasting hurling, which is a magnificent spectacle. Would it not be wonderful to have our unique game promoted worldwide? </P>
      <P>Public houses are obliged to close between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday. Many Sky sports programmes, including major soccer matches, are shown at this time. The law should be changed to allow people to watch these matches in public houses. Recently, half the pubs in my own town were raided when Manchester United were playing an important game at 3 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. People who did not have access to Sky channels were watching the match in public houses. This matter is not being addressed by the Government. Five or six months ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised to review public house opening hours and to extend them by one hour. I hope Sunday afternoon closing will be abolished. Families are being treated as criminals for watching a football match. In years to come people will not believe such a situation could have existed. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, who was a noted County Louth Gaelic football player and a fine striking man in his heyday, will understand the implications of what I am saying. We should not penalise people for the harmless activity of watching a football match on a Sunday afternoon when half the population does not have access to it in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister succeeds in her objective to curtail the pay channels and that RTE will continue to broadcast matches which are of great value to the public. Pay channels should not dominate our lives. Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch and those who own pay channels should not become billionaires at the expense of our culture. The motivation behind the Bill is worthy and I <Col N="1463" /> look forward to uninterrupted viewing at a reasonable cost which is not controlled by outside interests. I am not opposed to outside influences, but I do not wish to see our games taken over. There was a threat that the all-Ireland semi-finals and finals and the various provincial championships would be owned by the pay channels. This has now been eliminated.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who took the time to make speeches on this legislation. It has been a positive and useful debate in which Deputies expressed their views and concerns. It has also been good-humoured which is always welcome. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss the provisions of the Bill in detail. I look forward to dealing with any amendments the Opposition is interested in tabling at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Deputies have an appreciation of the issues involved and the importance of social, cultural and sporting events in our lives. There have been complex changes in the relationship between broadcasting and sport. As Deputy Deasy said, it is important that members of the public are not denied access to national sporting events on free to air services. They should not have to rely on pay per view channels, of which there has been a proliferation. It is in that context that the Bill is necessary. This is recognised at national and European Union level, particularly by the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny expressed disappointment that I have not published a list of events that I intend to designate under the provisions of the Bill. I will enter the consultation process provided for in the Bill with an open mind. The Opposition would have been the first to say that it was unwise to produce such a list mirroring my own prejudices. I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, broadcasters, events organisers and the public following which a comprehensive list will be drawn up. It should include major sporting and cultural events only.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey mentioned that the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language should have an input. I would welcome its views on the events that should be given priority in drawing up the list. Resolutions of both Houses will have to be made before an order can come into effect. This will provide the joint committee with an opportunity to make its views known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some events listed by Germany have been notified to the European Commission as follows: the Summer and Winter Olympic Games; European Championship and World Cup matches involving the German national team as well as the opening match, the semi-finals and finals of these competitions regardless of whether the German national team is playing; the semi-finals and final of the German FA Cup; the home and away matches of the German national team, and the <Col N="1464" /> final of any European club competition involving a German club.</P>
    <P>There are two categories of designated events in Italy, the first of which includes events which must be shown live and in full. They include: the Summer and Winter Olympic Games; the World Cup final and all matches involving the Italian national team; the final of the European Championships and all matches involving the Italian national team. Events in the second category, where broadcasters are free to decide the arrangements of an unencoded transmission, include: all matches involving the Italian national team at home and away in official competitions; the semi-finals and final of the Champions League and UEFA Cup where an Italian team is involved; the Tour of Italy cycling competition, and the Formula 1 Italian Grand Prix.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea may be interested to learn that the Italians have included the San Remo Italian Music Festival in this category. There may not be too many cultural events which have traditionally been covered and which suggest themselves in the same way as certain sporting events but it might be suggested that the Eurovision Song Contest, for example, should be considered a cultural event.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked how long the consultation process will take. For the process to have real meaning the Bill must be enacted. I intend to begin the process as soon as the Bill is signed into law and to allow every interested party to express his or her view. This will not cause any undue delay. It will be possible to amend any list which might be drawn up. I hope it will not have to be changed too often.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to a Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Michael D. Higgins which sought to address, in addition to television coverage of major events, the question of media ownership generally. The Tánaiste is considering the question of cross-media ownership and has asked the competition and mergers review group to look into the issue. I understand the group has not yet reported.</P>
    <P>The issue of sports organisers was raised by Deputy Donal Carey. I intend to ensure that these provisions interfere as little as possible with the market in sporting rights. That is why there is a reference to reasonable market rates in sections 4 and 7. I am well aware of the importance of this stream of revenue to sports organisations. The Deputy also referred to the importance of the North-South dimension in broadcasting. The new Broadcasting Bill, which I have just published, will enable me to require the digital television transmission entity to reserve capacity for Northern broadcasters. This power will be used if and when the British authorities introduce reciprocal arrangements for the carriage of broadcaster space on this side of the Border. That covers the issues Deputy Donal Carey raised.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Brendan Smith for his very positive and solid contribution. Deputy Gerry Reynolds also referred to the fact that TAM rat<Col N="1465" /> ings might not be as high as they could be for Oireachtas Report, and I agree with him that some people could view politics as no less than a blood sport. Deputy Deasy referred to the importance of universal coverage and that indigenous channels are available throughout the country. That is important and is another reason it is essential to protect major sporting events for the veiwership of all.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their positive views. When in Opposition I introduced a Private Members' Bill on major events television coverage. It was accepted by the Government but, unfortunately, did not come to fruition under the last Administration so I am pleased this Bill is before the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the issue of the term is being addressed. We have been very well served by the incumbent, but serving from 1975 to 2000 is an extremely long tenure in the context of any position, particularly one as sensitive as that of Director of Public Prosecutions. In the context of finalising the terms and conditions, will the Taoiseach consult with the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights or another appropriate body to see whether there can be a broader consensus in relation to the structure of this most important office?</P>

I think the terms of employment are set down but must be laid before the House for a period of 21 days. Apart from superannuation I do not think there are any other substantial changes to the terms of employment. The review body, on examining the post in 1992, stated that the position should be linked to that of Secretary General and the terms are essentially similar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the legislative framework under which the DPP is appointed, has the Taoiseach or the Government examined the relevant Act with a view to seeing whether a different procedure for appointment might be more appropriate than simply a decision of Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fairly wise people drew up the structures 25 years ago and the procedures are set out in the Act. The process is as follows: the Taoiseach requests the selection committee to select candidates for appointment to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the committee meets on a date and time determined by the Chief Justice and places an advertisement inviting applications, the committee selects suitable candidates for appointment and informs the Taoiseach, the director is appointed by the Government from among those selected by the committee. The committee comprises the Chief Justice, the chairman of the Bar Council, the president of the Incorporated Law Society, the Secretary General to the Government and the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General, while an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach acts as secretary to the committee. As with all such posts, the Government tends to do what is recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the selection board, the composition of which is probably in line with what was recommended 25 years ago, comprising almost exclusively of legal person<Col N="1467" /> ages. If legislation was currently before the House we would probably seek to have a representative of the social partners and certainly a representative of the consumer organisations and the general public included in such a board, rather than have it virtually exclusively composed of senior legal personnel, particularly given the indication from the Taoiseach that the Government would be highly unlikely to do any more than simply accept the recommendation of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is very closely aligned to the legal area and the Deputy is correct in saying the legislation was drafted on the basis of the board having a legal base. I am not sure we would include consumer interests on the board given the independence of the post of DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>I met with representatives of the Committee for the Administration of Justice and a representative of British-Irish Rights Watch last Wednesday. We discussed a number of issues and concerns that the groups had, particularly about the investigations that are taking place into the murders of Patrick Finucane and Rosemary Nelson and further issues about having public inquiries into these cases. I undertook to raise a number of their concerns with the Prime Minister and through the secretariat in Belfast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Is he aware that since we last discussed a truth commission during Taoiseach's Question <Col N="1468" /> Time considerable interest has been expressed to me in the establishment of such a commission? Pending the functioning of the Executive, have common terms of reference been drawn up or any preparatory work been either considered or agreed regarding how such a commission might function? Does he agree it is necessary to be extremely careful in ensuring a level playing pitch is created in terms of how past atrocities are dealt with? With the traumatic exhuming of the remains of the disappeared, will he agree that for the killers of Mrs. Jean McConville, for instance, to be granted immunity and left unnamed is inconsistent with the hue and cry for names and prosecution of British Army killers in the North? Will he agree there is a need to put in place terms of reference for a truth commission so that we are consistent and ensure that the peace process does not break down because different standards are being applied to different atrocities?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important point because we could have inquiries for certain cases and not for others. It is a point which has been put to me by many groups from Northern Ireland because at times they hear calls from one section of the community and that is a matter for concern.</P>
      <P>Since Mr. de Klerk attended the Peace and Reconciliation Forum in Dublin Castle there have been many discussions about a truth commission, but it has never received much of a hearing from any of the groups. I have raised this on a number of occasions. I even raised it recently with some of the groups since we were talking about it here, and that is still the position. Having said that, we must be careful about the standards and the way cases are processed because it is an issue which has the potential to create great hardship and suffering for people and groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach as saying that there has not been a ground swell initiative from the North in support of a truth commission but, in the light of his discussions with Mr. de Klerk and others who speak from experience, is the Taoiseach of the view that greater attention ought to be given to the establishment of such a commission in the North? Will he take initiatives to disseminate the information available from Mr. de Klerk, for instance, and ensure that there is a thorough examination of the possibilities of such a commission in current circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much that this has not been looked at, it is just that there has been a very negative response to it. On the other side of the argument, there has been an energetic campaign by people such as those to whom the question refers, the Committee for the Administration of Justice, Amnesty International, the British-Irish Rights Watch and other groups within Northern Ireland which have made cases for particular aspects to be looked at. There is the further inquiry into Bloody Sunday, the campaign <Col N="1469" /> for an inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Campaign for the Forgotten. There is the Mrs. Rosemary Nelson case, the Finucane case and many other cases which I have raised at the secretariat or have been considered by the British Government. There are also cases against people who are alive who have been threatened in one form or other by people on either side of the divide. It is hard to bring them altogether. As Mr. de Klerk told us at that time and as he outlined in documents which he sent to us subsequently, that is, a few years ago, the concept would fail unless people wanted it and were prepared and willing to accept it.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sargent will be aware, the big difficulty about all of these inquiries and investigations is the endless arguments about the terms on which people participate in them. All the difficulties at present about Mrs. Rosemary Nelson's case, whether people will co-operate, the basis of co-operation, to whom they are talking and the method of administration relate to only one or two cases. If those difficulties extended to other cases, of which I am aware but which I do not wish to put on the record, it would become a nightmare. However, I agree with the Deputy's basic point. We must be careful about consistency in this because solving the problem for one group, category or atrocity has exactly the opposite effect on another. I am very conscious of that.</P>

      <P>I will make a brief comment. I will not break your ruling on the substantive question because the Minister will make a statement. All our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones. This must be a harrowing time for them. They have suffered a terrible injustice over the years in not knowing the fate of those who were murdered. At least now their suffering has been acknowledged. I welcome the fact that information has been passed on and searches have begun.</P>
      <P>We had all hoped &ndash; certainly it was my information &ndash; that for the sake of the families this process would not be long and drawn out. I hope that the efforts of the Garda, on which I will not comment as the Minister will report on them later, will see early results. I certainly hope that if anyone, even someone who might be disassociated for a long time, has better information which would help in locating the remains of those who were killed they will provide that information as soon as possible because this House has given them immunity, as has Westminster. This is the call sought by Deputy Howlin which I make on behalf of the Government and the House. For the sake of the relatives, if for no other reason, they should do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>An Post is the main supplier of payment delivery services to my Department's customers. In 1998 some 45.7 million social welfare payments were cashed in post offices at a cost to my Department of about £36 million pounds. This represents 80 per cent of all social welfare payments. I fully appreciate the significance to An Post of the revenues it earns from supplying payments delivery services to my Department. Equally, I appreciate the role which An Post and its staff continue to play in meeting the needs of my Department's customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has adopted a two-part strategy which is designed to underpin its commitment to a viable post office network. The first part of this strategy will be the renewal, for a period of three years, of the contract under which my Department purchases social welfare payment delivery services from An Post. This decision will maintain a revenue stream for An Post from the services which it sells to my Department. The second element of the strategy is, as announced by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, to further develop the post office network so it can, in the future, provide a new one-stop-shop service to citizens. In this context, it is intended that facilities will be provided in post offices in some areas to enable, for example, the payment of electricity bills and the purchase of airline tickets. It is also intended to install public access points to the Internet and other technology related facilities. An interdepartmental committee is being established to further these initiatives. These developments are a clear indication of this <Col N="1472" /> Government's continuing commitment to ensuring a commercially viable future for the post office network.</P>
    <P>My policy in relation to social welfare payment delivery systems generally is to provide a modern, cost-effective and convenient payments delivery service for my Department's customers. In recent years An Post has undertaken a counter modernisation programme and the extension of the contract for social welfare payments will enable the company to further develop its facilities to meet this challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. We welcome this initiative as rural post offices play a very important role throughout the country. The Minister has indicated that post offices will be provided with facilities to do a lot more business. I hope that is not merely an election gimmick and will be followed through after the election.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the cost of providing services through An Post is approximately £36 million. When we discussed the social welfare Estimates in committee, the figure outlined on page six of the Estimates for this year was just under £22 million. Why is the £36 million figure commonly used when the reference to An Post outlined in the Estimates is £22 million? Perhaps there is a simple explanation for that.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the scare in regard to post office closures emanated from the Minister's public statement on the contract, the advertisement placed in relation to it and the indication that EU law necessitated a particular course of action? Was it not the Minister himself who created the worry about this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the extension of post office services, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with responsibility for rural development, Deputy Davern, will shortly publish a White Paper on rural development which will incorporate many of the suggestions to which I referred. Much of what he is proposing as Government policy in the White Paper relates to the cultivation of the rural post office network into a one-stop-shop concept. Thus, recent announcements in regard to the further modernisation of the post office network already formed part of proposed Government policy. In effect, we announced those proposals at the same time as the announcement on the contract.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the £22 million figure with me previously and I have since checked it out. That figure relates to the Exchequer funding required for social assistance payments; the balance of the £36 million figure comes from the social insurance fund which relates to benefit payments generally. The overall figure for the contract is £36 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the first opportunities I have had to refer publicly to this issue as I have been precluded to some extent from commenting on it <Col N="1473" /> before now. Deputies, particularly those who have served in Government, will be aware that for any Minister or Department to intervene or show favouritism to a particular side when a Government contract is put out to tender, prior to the awarding of the contract, would leave the Department and the State in the dangerous position of a possible legal action being taken against them by aggrieved parties.</P>
    <P>It is important that we provide some kind of historical view on this matter. A five year contract was awarded to An Post in 1992. In 1996 the Government Contracts Committee, under the Government of which the Deputies opposite were members, decided to extend the An Post contract for a period of three years after which time the contract would be awarded following a competitive process and having due regard to the relevant EU public procurement directive.</P>
    <P>At that stage, it was recognised and understood that the contract would be put out to public tender and the Department proceeded on that basis. I attempted to ascertain whether legal advice was obtained from the Attorney General or others in 1996 on the issue of whether this service was a social or financial one. As far as I could ascertain, no advice was sought or given at the time.</P>
    <P>When the matter of the contract arose, the Department was obliged within a certain timeframe, to publish a pre-indicative notice in the <i>European Journal</i> and that was done on the basis, understood for many years, that the contract would have to be put out to open tender. From as far back as last October or November, the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Taoiseach and I were involved in discussions with the Postmasters' Union and other interested parties as we were aware that this issue was coming up for consideration. Following long and detailed discussions involving the Attorney General, the Government felt confident about awarding the contract to An Post without undergoing the open tender process.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General advised that the contract and the nature of the payment delivery service required from An Post does not come under the terms of the directive. I have no doubt Deputies on all sides of the House welcome that. I did not make any statements which indicated one way or another whether this contract would go out to public tender or to An Post. The issue had to be determined and only when I and my Cabinet colleagues sought legal advice, which was not previously sought, was a determination made as to whether the nature of the service was financial or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Why did 45,000 people on disability benefit receive a letter from the Minister's <Col N="1474" /> Department informing them that they would have to go to a bank or building society to collect payments and that, effectively, 1,500 post offices would be closed with the loss of up to 4,000 jobs? I sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment to ascertain whether the Minister intended to shaft Irish post offices and withdraw social services in rural and urban areas alike. Post offices in two parishes in my constituency, Edenmore and Donaghmede, also felt threatened by closure because of the Minister's incompetence. The Minister and the Attorney General must have been aware that the matter could have been dealt with under social and other services. Why then did the Minister proceed to send out those letters and threaten the social fabric of Irish post offices? The Minister's comments come very close to misleading the House.</P>

      <Quest>the new measures, if any, he proposes to ensure there is a full take-up of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a specified means test. A qualified child is one who falls into one of the age groups specified for the scheme and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of widows and widowers contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple. Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable. Under the scheme, a once-off payment of £43 is made in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from 1 June each year. My Department has requested the boards to ensure that the majority of payments are made by 31 July 1999 to enable parents make the necessary purchases in the traditional back to school shopping month of August. Based on the experience of health board staff, this represents the optimum time for payment of this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The health boards have advised that the scheme operated satisfactorily in 1998 with the vast majority of qualified families throughout the country receiving their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>
    <P>In 1998, expenditure on back to school clothing and footwear allowance amounted to £10.2 million in respect of 209,300 children.</P>
    <P>The scheme is widely publicised every summer in each individual health board area. Information regarding the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is also available in the back to school clothing and footwear information leaflet, SW75, the supplementary welfare allowance information booklet, SW54, and the guide to social welfare services book, SW4, or by contacting any local health centre. I am satisfied this is sufficient to achieve a high level of take up of these entitlements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter previously. Will the Minister agree that a high proportion of people who qualify for this payment in respect of their dependent children in the two to four age bracket do not take it up? I tried to get the figures from the Minister's Department. They have given us some indication on the take-up of the allowance at that level but it is clear that many people are unaware that they are entitled to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for children in the two to four age category. Will the Minister take an initiative in that regard and publicise the scheme?</P>
      <P>The second category in respect of which there is not a full take-up is the 17 to 22 years age group, many of whom may be in college. If students are attending college their parents qualify for the allowance because of the payment they receive for them. They, too, should be targeted to ensure full take-up of the scheme because again, within that category, there is a low take-up in relation to the number of people who qualify for it. Will the Minister come forward with an initiative to target the two to four and the 17 to 22 age groups because they are not taking up the scheme in sufficient numbers? I ask the Minister to take a special interest in those categories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of queries raised by the Deputy during Question Time on previous occasions, we have indicated to all the health boards that the collection of statistical information in this regard should be done in a more user friendly way because the two to 11 year old and the various other categories are quite large. It is accepted, by and large, that a high proportion of eligible people are retaining this allowance. Obviously we will endeavour at all times to publicise the scheme as widely as possible. I accept the Deputy's point about the 17 to 22 year age group but the figures show that approximately 7,300 people are in receipt of the payment, which is significant. Obviously the figures for the lower age groups are much higher. It will probably take some time to get all the figures because this <Col N="1477" /> scheme is administered by the health boards. The figure for the two to 11 year age group is 119,100; for the 12 to 17 year age group it is 82,900; and for the 18 to 22 year age category it is 7,300, making a total of 209,300.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the unemployment benefit scheme as it applied to unemployed workers who have received redundancy payments gives due recognition to these workers record of insurance contributions paid.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14326/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 47(4) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, sets out the circumstances under which a person may be disqualified from entitlement to unemployment benefit. One such circumstance relates to claimants who receive a redundancy lump sum payment, in accordance with the terms of the redundancy payment Acts, which is in excess of £15,000.</P>
      <P>This measure was introduced in 1992 and was designed to counter situations where the Social Insurance Fund was, in effect, being used as a top-up to substantial redundancy packages which also, in some cases, offered fixed period seasonal work. This had the effect of ensuring a person's continuous entitlement to unemployment benefit when he was not working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position now is that a person, provided he or she is under the age of 55, who has received a <Col N="1478" /> redundancy payment from his or her employer in excess of £15,000, shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks from the last date of employment. The duration of the disqualification may be up to a maximum period of nine weeks.</P>
    <P>The guidelines issued to deciding officers advise that, in considering an unemployment benefit claim made by a person who has just been made redundant, they should take account of a range of factors which could include, for example, the claimant's age, particularly in relation to the age limit of 55, and the job expectancy in the same region for a person of similar age and job skills; family difficulties e.g. illness which would affect financial security or future job prospects; and the extent to which the redundancy payment exceeds the £15,000 limit.</P>
    <P>As a general guide, provided there are no other factors involved, claimants are disqualified from entitlement to unemployment benefit for one week for every £5,000 above the £15,000 threshold, subject to an absolute maximum of nine weeks disqualification.</P>
    <P>It is important to achieve a balance between the need to ensure that the integrity of the Social Insurance Fund is protected and the need to ensure that the legitimate expectations of insured workers are met. In that context, the arrangements in respect of people who receive redundancy payments, as I have outlined them, are not unreasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we reached this question as I am very angry about this issue. Will the Minister concede that the unemployment benefit system is an insurance scheme in which one accumulate credits? For example, a person who pays into a scheme for 25 years expects better benefits than a person who pays into it for only ten years, but that is not the case. I know of one case in which a man who paid into the scheme for 27 years was made redundant. This man cannot draw unemployment benefit for seven weeks because of his redundancy payment. His colleague who had ten years' credits qualified for unemployment benefit immediately. Does the Minister agree this is unfair? Does it not go against the whole concept of insurance schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister further agree the discretion of deciding officers in this regard is not being applied uniformly across the country or even in the same town? For example, discretion was applied to the redundancies received by Tarkett workers in Mullingar, yet those made redundant from the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> lost that discretion. These two sets of redundancies occurred within a short time of each other. Does the Minister agree there is a difference of opinion between the section of the Department that deals with this scheme and the planning section? The discretion does not exist at ground level and local offices have been told to take away the dis<Col N="1479" /> cretionary nature of the scheme. Does the Minister agree this is unfair and it should be reviewed?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He raised it at a recent select committee and on 24 May a letter was sent to him explaining the position concerning discretion. The deciding officers and the appeals officers are independent and have discretion in these matters. I would be worried if the guidelines, which have been in place for some time, are not being adopted as uniformly as they should be and I will examine the cases referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the case of a person with 27 years' contributions as opposed to a person with ten years' contributions. I would be interested to know the level of redundancy received by the two people concerned. If we were to treat these people equally, in effect, one would allow someone with a substantial redundancy payment to top up that payment with taxpayers' money. In 1992 we endeavoured to draw up a balanced approach to the issue of someone receiving a large redundancy payment and immediately qualifying for UB.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows social insurance in not like other insurance policies. The fact that someone pays a certain amount into social insurance through PRSI does not mean he or she is entitled to reclaim that amount. Social insurance does not work like that, it is about intergenerational social solidarity.</P>

      <P>As advertised last April, the student summer jobs scheme will operate from 1 June 1999 to 31 August 1999 during which approved students will be allowed undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour. It is estimated that about 11,000 students will participate in the 1999 scheme. The closing date for the receipt of applications is 25 June 1999. To date, 10,200 students have applied of whom 5,000 have been approved to participate in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The student summer jobs scheme was introduced in 1993 and was intended to assist students who were not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period and <Col N="1480" /> who were unable to get a summer job. The fact that, in recent years, there has been a wider availability of jobs in other areas has brought about a lower level of recourse to the scheme. It is clearly more beneficial for students to obtain employment in the open market and I hope to see further evidence of this trend in 1999. The future development of the student scheme will depend on the experience in the current year and the needs identified in light of that experience.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> The scheme was geared towards those students who would normally qualify for UA for which there is a basic means test. The scheme did not allow those over the guidelines for grants to apply. Students must satisfy a weekly means test which is assessed at £65 or less &ndash; a low rate. That has always been the way. This scheme is designed to help students from less well off families, not those from families who would be able to assist their children by way of grants or whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a copy of the report to which the Deputy refers and have noted its contents. While this report is based on analysis of 1994 data, it provides some valuable insight into the causes of, and trends in, poverty among women in Ireland during the early 1990s. The report was only released last Thursday and will be considered alongside analysis of more recent complementary data from the ESRI based on the 1997 Living in Ireland Survey.</P>
      <P>The data shows that female-headed households are at greater risk of falling below the 50 per cent relative income line than are male/couple-headed households. It is important to note here that &ldquo;female-headed&rdquo; households comprised just 23 per cent of all households in 1994, mainly consisting of women living alone and lone parents, both being groups which this Government has already recognised as facing a higher risk of poverty than the population at large. Previously in an answer to a similar question I gave a figure of less than 10 per cent instead of 23 per cent. That was incorrect and I should like to correct the record in that regard. The reason the incorrect answer was given was because there was a misinterpretation of data by my officials in the Department. I am anxious to correct that figure of 10 per cent previously given; it is in fact 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that, because the majority of adult men and women live in couple households, they face similar risks of being poor. The relatively high risk of poverty faced by female-headed households is not representative of the position of women in general although, overall, women do face a slightly higher risk of poverty than men.</P>
      <P>This Government has committed itself to the realisation of true equality for women and to ensuring that women can realise their full potential in society. In addition, one of the key principles underlying the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) is &ldquo;the reduction of inequalities and, in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty&rdquo; and a number of initiatives are already in place which aim, inter alia, to ease the burden on predominantly female-headed households.</P>
      <P>A working group to examine the tax and social welfare treatment of married, co-habiting and one-parent families was established in May 1997. Underlying the necessity of such a review was a need to ensure fairness in the way that the State supports families of all types, while at the same time providing assistance for families who are at particular risk of poverty. The group will report to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of poverty proofing across all Government Departments, which aims to assess <Col N="1483" /> significant policy proposals at design stage for their impact on the poor, is also a major step in this regard. Lone parents and single adult households are among the groups given particular attention in this process.</P>
    <P>My Department also recognises that women, in both urban and rural areas, can experience particular problems arising from poverty and marginalisation and that women's groups and community groups have an important role in tackling these problems. Particular emphasis is placed in the various grant schemes operated by my Department on support for community-based initiatives targeted at disadvantaged women. Schemes of particular relevance in this regard are the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme, and the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>In addition, I recently announced the introduction of a new pilot initiative &ndash; the Family Services Projects &ndash; to develop new models of service delivery based on the one-stop-shop concept aimed at enhancing the Department's services to families. The new projects will be piloted in Cork, Waterford and Finglas in Dublin and will cater for all families, providing information on marriage counselling, bereavement counselling, parenting including childcare, family mediation and other services available locally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic conclusions of the Women and Poverty in Ireland report were that lone parent households increased from 17 per cent in 1987 to 32 per cent in 1994 and that the risk of poverty for female headed households rose from 4 per cent to 24 per cent. Does the Minister not agree that these are shocking conclusions, as one of the authors of the report said? The Minister has particular responsibility to alleviate this problem.</P>
      <P>What difference, if any, occurred in the percentages for 1997? The authors of the report point out that the level of some social welfare payments is so low that it is a fundamental contributory factor to the poverty of these female headed households. Does the Minister agree that one initiative he could take is to drastically increase child benefit to £20 per week?</P>

      <P>There have been dramatic changes since 1994. I cannot give the Deputy details for 1997 because the report was only released a couple of days ago and would have to be viewed in light of those figures. I launched a report yesterday by the ESRI in relation to that. It contains good figures in one sense but also indications that, as a society, we need to do more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the issue of women's equality and ensuring that female poverty does not increase but is reduced is one of the issues that will be addressed by the Government. In recent years we have brought forward a number of initiatives. Ultimately, however, the best way out of poverty <Col N="1484" /> is through employment. Since this Government came into office, 90,000 new jobs have been provided and 62,000 people have gone off the live register, many of them female. Female participation in society has increased dramatically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that widows constitute another group of women affected by poverty? The solution he puts forward, that these women go out to work, is often not available to them. They are left in the terrible situation of having lost their spouse and having to look after a household, keep up mortgage repayments and so forth when they are simply unable to manage on the payments from the Department. Does the Minister not think they should be given special consideration and special rates of payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two budgets, widows over 66 years of age on the maximum rate of widow's pension have received substantial increases of £5 and £6 per week, increases which are way ahead of inflation and far more than what was given to them under previous Governments. Widows under 66 years of age received increases last year which were twice the rate of inflation. In addition, in the Government's first budget, dramatic changes were made to tax allowances for widows. They were given special treatment by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>This is an area where the Government acknowledges that more needs to be done and, over forthcoming budgets for the duration of this Government's term, it will be done.</P>

      <P>The Government, in its action programme, is committed to the development of the social insurance system and to increasing the maximum personal rate of contributory pensions to £100 per week by 2002. Significant progress towards achieving this target has been made in the past two budgets which provided for a total increase of £11 per week, to £89 per week, in the maximum personal rates of contributory pensions. This represents an increase of 14 per cent since the Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from pensions, the social insurance system provides for a range of important short-term benefits such as unemployment and disability benefits. These benefits have been subject to ongoing improvement over the years. For example, a new bereavement grant was intro<Col N="1485" /> duced earlier this year replacing the death grant. The grant is increased from £100 to £500 and cover was extended to include the self employed and modified PRSI contributors.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently set up a working group on social insurance which comprises representatives of the principal social partners and officials from my Department. The purpose of the group, which met for the first time late last month, is to examine issues relating to the ongoing development of the social insurance system as it relates to employed contributors. This will include examining the possibility of providing and financing new benefits such as a carer's benefit. It is hoped that the deliberations of the group will inform all parties on the issues involved and explore the level of consensus as to future priorities.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of the pensions area generally and social insurance in particular a number of important developments have already taken place, for example, the national pensions policy initiative. The financial position of the social insurance system is secure in the short term. As Deputies will be aware, the 1998 Social Welfare Act provided for regular actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund. The legislation requires that the first such review be completed by 31 December 2002, with subsequent reviews every five years. These reviews will enable the future of the fund to be kept under regular review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the ratio of total social welfare spending to national income has been falling steadily. Ireland is now the second lowest country in the EU after Portugal in its spend on social welfare. What is the ratio of the social insurance fund to the total social welfare budget in recent years?</P>
      <P>I and other Deputies welcome the possible provision of additional benefits, particularly the carer's benefit which carers organisations have been seeking for years. I urge the Minister to introduce that in next year's budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned actuarial reviews and the national pensions policy initiative. What size fund does the Minister believe it is necessary to maintain with respect to the entire social welfare fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On carer's benefit, the reason mentioned is the reason we established the group. I initiated discussions with some of the social partners. I firmly believe carer's benefit will be required into the future given that the actuarial review shows that, over an extended period, the number of elderly people who need care will increase dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure to what the Deputy refers regarding the social insurance fund. The fund has gone into the black over the past few years for first time in a long time. A number of initiatives, such as the bereavement grant and pensions for those who first make contributions after the age of 56, <Col N="1486" /> have been taken by me in this area with the aid of the surplus in the social insurance fund. However, we must plan for the future and the same applies to Exchequer funding generally. I have often said that, while we politicians might like to spend surplus revenue, we must prepare for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, which, <i>inter alia</i>, provided the special arrangements effective from 7 April 1999 for farmers on low incomes. The scheme was originally intended to be brought into effect in June of this year, but the Government decided to advance the start-up date to 7 April to ensure that the earliest possible response was made to the difficulties experienced by the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm assist scheme is designed to replace the existing smallholder's dole scheme. Under <Col N="1488" /> that scheme, farmers may qualify for a rate of payment similar to the unemployment assistance rate and on the same basis. The farm assist scheme relaxes the means test conditions to cater for the special circumstances of farming. Normally social welfare payments based on means assessments are awarded from the date of application by a claimant. However, in this instance the Government decided to backdate to 7 April 1999 all successful applications made on or before 31 May 1999. Claims made subsequent to 31 May will be treated similarly to all other means payments and admitted from the date of application.</P>
    <P>Many of the 6,500 smallholders have not yet replied to the Department's letter and have been written to a second time. Those who have replied are being reviewed and progressively transferred to the farm assist scheme with effect from 7 April. Those who did not reply by 29 May will be maintained on their current rate of payment until such time as they can be reviewed. These reviews will take place over coming months and the people concerned will be transferred, as appropriate, to the farm assist scheme from the date of review.</P>
    <P>The number of new applications for farm assist from farmers not in the smallholder's scheme is now approaching 1,000. These claims are being processed as quickly as possible and all will be backdated to 7 April. The number of claims is likely to rise over time albeit the intake is at a slower rate than was first anticipated. It represents a long-term safety net for farmers and is not simply a once-off response to a critical situation.</P>
    <P>At present, some 1,500 applications from existing and new claimants have been processed and weekly payments are averaging at almost £86. This compares with an average of £75 a week on the smallholder's scheme. However, it would be premature to draw conclusions from the data at this stage and the Department would need to have results from a greater number of claims processed under the new rules before being able to assess the impact of the new provisions and the comprehensive review of the existing stock of smallholders' claims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that a net 500 additional people have applied for the new farm assist scheme? He said that there are 1,500 people in the scheme, 1,000 of whom transferred from the smallholder's scheme. Why does he believe the level of applications is running so low?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that. It was anticipated in negotiations with the farming organisations that about 13,000 farmers would apply. Some 40,000 farmers walked the streets of Dublin not so long ago for a response to the grave situation which existed then in the farming sector. Given that the weather has improved and farmers are out working on their farms, and because the nature of farming is cyclical &ndash; I often made the point about their assessment that there are good <Col N="1489" /> times and bad times in a year &ndash; farmers are probably not exercised about farm assist at present. However, a time will probably come later in the year when they will have to apply for it to maintain their household income. It was originally estimated that about 13,000 farmers would apply for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the scheme is a failure because it is not an alternative to the family income supplement and because of the type of administration it entails with which many farmers are loath to become involved because of the type of questions asked? The results are abysmal because those who have been assessed have received an increase of only £11. Does the Minister accept this scheme will not solve the problems of many farm families who are in severe difficulties? Will he reconsider the position and introduce a scheme, similar to that which applies to ordinary workers, to meet the income needs of farm families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's statement, given that he is a former member &ndash; perhaps he remains a member &ndash; of the IFA. Tom Parlon, the leader of that organisation, recently stated in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> that the pleas of the 40,000 farmers who marched through the streets of Dublin recently had been answered by the implementation of the farm assist scheme. When the IFA met the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party approximately 12 months ago it made two demands, one of which stipulated that an income support scheme for farmers be put in place. That scheme was put in place following negotiations with the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position. Family income supplement relates only to farmers with children, whereas the farm assist scheme also relates to single farmers, many of whom are facing extreme difficulties. The other demand made by farmers was that we should do something which had been promised but not delivered by successive Governments, namely, take action in respect of those farmers over 56 years of age who fell out of the pensions net.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>All those in receipt of the carer's allowance on 3 June 1999 will receive the respite care grant of £200. The grant will also be paid to carers of those in receipt of prescribed relatives allowance and constant attendance allowance. It is estimated that almost 12,000 people will receive the grant at a cost of almost £2.4 million. There are no additional qualifying conditions for this grant, which will be paid every year.</P>
      <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>The measures I introduced in the 1999 budget clearly indicate my personal commitment, and that of the Government, to carers who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities, and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. The budget package, costing more than £18 million, represents a 40 per cent increase on existing expenditure and is a very considerable addition to the £45 million spent on carers in 1998. In total, the expenditure in this area will be £63 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, my colleagues the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers in the budget as part of a co-ordinated response. The Government is also conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required and needs to be developed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that 12,000 people will receive the respite grant of £200. However, does the Minister acknowledge that there are perhaps 40,000 additional carers who will not receive any allowance from the Department either in respect of respite care or other services? Would it not be better to extend the scheme to those who receive nothing from the Department for the tremendous work they do in looking after people who are in need of constant care? Even if this were only a once-off payment once a year, it would be a small recognition of the tremendous work these people do. As it <Col N="1491" /> stands, the Minister is giving the £200 grant to 12,000 carers who deserve it. Could he not give something to the additional 30,000 to 40,000 who get no recognition for the services they provide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have primary responsibility for people's health, I have responsibility for the payment of carer's allowance. Everyone who qualifies for payment of carer's allowance from my Department will also qualify for the £200 grant which they will receive each year in which they continue to qualify. As already stated, this will cost £2.4 million. The Minister for Health and Children has already put in place a number of major initiatives for the provision of respite beds. To a certain extent, these initiatives will cater for other demands in this area.</P>
      <P>If we were to give the grant to the 40,000 people &ndash; there may be more &ndash; to whom the Deputy referred, the cost of £2.4 million would increase dramatically. My Department would find it extremely difficult to discover the identity of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister were to extend payment of the grant to a further 30,000 people, the cost would rise by a mere £7 million. Does the Minister not agree this would be money well spent and that it would provide some recognition of the work done by those people who care for relatives in their homes on a 24 hours a day basis? These people provide the service to which I refer day after day and week after week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department cannot quantify the expenditure that would be required because the major responsibility in this area lies with the Department of Health and Children. I am not trying to pass the buck and I accept my Department retains responsibility for carer's allowance. As a result of the review of the carer's allowance payment, a report was compiled with the assistance of the my Department and the Departments of Finance and Health and Children which strongly suggested that a needs assessment system should be introduced which could be used to identify the needs of each individual. Ultimately, this will be the way forward. As a result of the review, an interdepartmental committee chaired by Deputy Moffatt was established to investigate the issue of needs assessment. I suggest that this is the route we should take in the future rather than taking a &ldquo;big sweep&rdquo; approach which probably catches many people but does not represent the best use of the limited resources available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the remarks of Deputy McGrath. Does the Minister agree another avenue of approach to assist the 40,000 plus carers would be to provide a sufficient number of respite care places for the people for whom they care, particularly those with serious illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease etc? The number of such places currently provided is appallingly low. <Col N="1492" /> On the northside of Dublin, for example, people were obliged to fall back on using facilities such as St. Ita's. Will the people who qualify for carer's allowance later in the year qualify for a portion of the £200 grant during the period 1999-2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter question, my understanding is that the grant will be paid in June of every year. Therefore, once people qualify for carer's allowance in the current year they will receive the grant next June.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the provision of respite care services rests with the Department of Health and Children. There have always been difficulties in this area, irrespective of who is in Government, but the Minister for Health and Children is committed to improving respite care services. He introduced a major initiative in respect of the supply of respite care places in the recent budget. On behalf of the Government, I endeavoured to co-ordinate an overall response from a number of Department's in respect of carers. As a result, additional funding was provided by the Department of Health and Children for respite care services and the Department of the Environment and Local Government increased the disabled person's grant from £8,000 to £12,000. The Department of Finance also introduced major changes in tax allowances, primarily at the instigation of my Department, so that the children and extended families of carers would be able to avail of the existing allowance of £8,500 which had previously been available only to spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister allow single people, who qualify as a result of the change in the budget, to apply in August for the carer's allowance? That change means their families will not get the £200 allowance this year. If the Minister is still in Government for next year's budget, will he consider increasing the amount disallowed, which is £150, because it has not been increased in the last two budgets? Many people are not able to claim the carer's allowance because the disregard is so low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's disregard is one of the highest in the social welfare system in special recognition of the difficult job carers do. As I said at the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, I intend to look at this issue in the context of the budget in December. As regards qualifying and applying for the carer's allowance, my understanding is that the respite payment is made once a year and that people will qualify if they are still on the carer's allowance next June. A once-off payment will be made every year and the recipients will get it when they subsequently apply the following year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that young people participating in apprenticeships paying the equiv alent of social welfare rates are not eligible for rent allowances; if he will review this regulation given that it may put pressure on apprentices who are not living in the family home to give up the apprenticeship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide a basic weekly allowance to eligible people who have little or no income. Those eligible for assistance under the SWA scheme would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment and would have to satisfy a number of criteria, including a means test. In addition, people with low incomes may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs, for example, rent and mortgage interest payments, or a payment to assist with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing the payment of SWA precludes any person in full-time employment from receiving a rent supplement under the SWA scheme. A person is regarded as being engaged in remunerative full-time work where he or she is working for not less than 30 hours a week.</P>
      <P>Single people on low pay, such as apprentices and trainees who are in full-time employment, do not qualify for a rent supplement and must provide for their own accommodation needs. I am aware that this can act as a disincentive to work for those on low pay, especially where they have significant housing costs. The responsibility for setting rates of payment for apprentices and ensuring that wage levels for all workers are fair and reasonable is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The introduction of a national minimum wage will help to address this matter.</P>
      <P>Between 1989 and 1998 expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements increased from £6 million to £88 million and is expected to rise to more than £100 million in 1999. The extension of the SWA scheme to include the payment of rent supplement to single people in low paid employment, including apprentices and trainees, would involve a significant departure from the scheme as it currently operates and would have major financial implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the rent supplement scheme will be examined shortly in the context of the Government's commitment under Partnership 2000 to consider a tapering arrangement for SWA housing supplements, in consultation with the social partners. In addition, an interdepartmental committee is examining the transfer of the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to local authorities. I understand the final report of this committee will be submitted to the Government shortly. The further development of the SWA rent supplement scheme to address this and other issues can be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account the discussions with the social partners and the con<Col N="1494" /> clusions reached by the interdepartmental committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is petty to restrict apprentices to low rates of pay which are equivalent to social welfare rates. Why should they not benefit from rent supplements, particularly in the context of the current housing crisis and the fact that rents and house prices are scheduled to increase by a further 20 per cent this year? This is a disincentive for young people and an encouragement to give up apprenticeships. The Minister should consider this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of rent supplement being a disincentive to work has been around for some time and is being considered in Partnership 2000 with the social partners. I have no doubt the issue to which the Deputy referred will be looked at in that respect. To include all people on low income and trainees and apprentices would be a major departure in terms of rent supplement and SWA, which is a safety net for people who are not at work or do not have the ability to work.</P>
      <P>The SWA scheme and its delivery was raised at the Committee of Public Accounts recently. That is one of the reasons the Government has initiated this examination of rent and mortgage supplements. The figure has increased dramatically and is now well over the £100 million estimated in 1999. We must look at this in the context of the need to provide housing for people. This situation is no different from that which pertained a number of years ago. I have no doubt this issue is being looked at by the social partners in the context of the Partnership 2000 arrangements.</P>

      <P>It has always been the case that increases in the thresholds which determine entitlement to family income supplement have been introduced in tandem with the general increases in social welfare rates and, in particular, with the increases in the rate of unemployment assistance. The purpose of family income supplement is to provide an incentive to low paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment rather than availing of unemployment payments. The increases in the FIS thresholds are intended to ensure that, at a minimum, the incentive to take up or remain in low-paid employment is maintained and, where resources permit, enhanced. In that context, it is reasonable that these increases should be introduced in tandem with the increases in the rates of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> The question of bringing forward the increases in the FIS thresholds to bring them into line with the tax year would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context. On a general level, however, and given the purpose of the increases as I have outlined, the existing arrangements are reasonable and appropriate. The 1999 budget provides for an increase of £8 in the income thresholds at each point, which will ensure that virtually all those receiving FIS payments will gain by £5 per week.</P>

      <P>We have undertaken a major information campaign. Last September I launched a document, &ldquo;It Pays to Work&rdquo;, which brought together all the State agencies. One of its main planks was the family income supplement. The one major change in family income supplement was made by this Government. In our first budget we calculated family income supplement on a net income basis. That is expected to bring a further 7,500 people into the family income supplement net. The figure as of 21 May 1999 is 14,570 claimants, which represents the largest number recorded in this scheme. We estimate that this is likely to increase further given the increased publicity particularly from the document, &ldquo;It Pays to Work&rdquo;. Strenuous efforts are to be made in regard to publicity. The positive impact of the move from gross to net assessment is illustrated by the increase in the number of applications received from 1 October 1998 to 31 December 1998.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the scheme should be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and not his Department? When an individual falls below the threshold, he or she should automatically qualify for FIS and, hence, it would make it easier to administer. Many people do not know they qualify and it is estimated that there is only a 50 per cent take up of FIS. Could the Minister at least liaise with Revenue and ask it to contact people on low incomes so that there will be a 100 per cent take up?</P>

      <P>Historically, the scheme has been administered by my Department and there are not any plans to remove it from my Department. The Deputy's point might by worthy of consideration down the line but between October and December 1998, the period to which I referred earlier, 2,834 first time applications were received, an increase of 55 per cent on the equivalent figure in 1997. It can be seen that there is a strenuous effort on the part of my Department to publicise this scheme and that people are applying in greater numbers than heretofore.</P>

      <P>People claiming social welfare payments are required to make their claims within a specified period. Where a claim is not made in time, payment can only be backdated for a specified period, the duration of which varies with the type of claim. The Ombudsman conducted a formal investigation into complaints by pensioners who suffered loss of payment under these arrangements and published a report on his findings and recommendations on 14 March 1997.</P>
      <P>In the light of this report, a number of improvements have been made affecting claims to retirement, old age contributory, widow's and widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance. Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1997, for backdating claims in the case of retirement, old age contributory, widow's and widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance for up to 12 months, instead of the six month period applicable up then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These new arrangements applied to claims made on or after 1 January 1997. Under subsequent regulations which I made in February 1998, a proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid, for those who made claims on or after 1 January 1997. While these provisions represented a considerable improvement on the previous position, <Col N="1497" /> I was concerned that a significant number of pensioners who had applied for pension prior to 1 January 1997 did not benefit from these improvements.</P>
    <P>I am happy, therefore, that provision was made in this year's budget for the payment of proportionate arrears of pension in the case of late claims made prior to 1 January 1997 in respect of retirement, old age contributory, widow's and widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance. Payment of proportionate arrears of pension due under these new arrangements has so far been made to 706 pensioners. Work is under way in my Department to identify and pay other pensioners where such arrears payments may be due.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the review. However, I ask the Minister to consult his officials. I am aware of one case where it is obvious why the individual did not apply. It is nine weeks since the application was made and, having spoken to the social welfare office, I am under the impression that it could be many weeks before a decision is made. It is a black and white case for which medical evidence can be supplied. Will the Minister tell his officials to get on with the job?

      <P>The Minister referred to the Ombudsman's decision to extend the back payment period from six to 12 months. Was that the Ombudsman's decision or one made by the Department as a result of his decision that six months was not sufficient? Why does this not apply to other social welfare benefits, such as the invalidity pension and the unmarried mother's <Col N="1498" /> allowance? If a person is not literate &ndash; and there is a huge amount of adult illiteracy in Ireland, even among adolescents &ndash; or in poor health or of unsound mind, why is it not applicable indefinitely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension from six to 12 months was implemented by the previous Government based on very strong suggestions by the Ombudsman. I brought in the regulations which followed from that based on the decision of the previous Government and I do not say this in any political way. The Ombudsman was still not happy and issued a subsequent report. It was an issue which I felt strongly about because a number of Members on all sides of the House had specific cases where difficulties were encountered by people who through no fault of their own had not applied on time. That is why the Government allocated an extra £10 million for this to allow even further back payment to people. It did not go all the way but the new arrangements are significant because it is estimated that an extra 4,000 to 5,000 people will apply.</P>
      <P>The reason it does not apply to other benefits is that the Ombudsman's report was based on pensions alone, particularly those to which I referred. There are a number of exceptions to all those let outs. For example, if my Department issued incorrect information and based on that people did not apply, they would be entitled to the full amount of back pay arising from the supply of wrong information. I have come across cases where that has been acceded to.</P>

      <P>The project to ensure that computer systems in my Department are year 2000 compliant is very well advanced. Compliance work has been completed for all computer applications which support the Department's core business of processing claims and making payments across a wide variety of schemes. Some systems, such as child benefit and family income supplement, have already successfully produced payment orders with dates beyond 31 December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also well advanced in the testing and upgrading of all computer hardware, system software and network components. Integration tests between the Department and a number of external key suppliers, who have computer links to the Department, are almost complete. My Department has been actively monitoring the year 2000 compliance progress in the three bodies under its aegis &ndash; the Combat Poverty Agency, the National Social Services Board and the Pen<Col N="1499" /> sions Board. It is expected full compliance will have been achieved for all three before the end of June.</P>
    <P>The overall target date for achievement of year 2000 compliance is July 1998. Some residual testing of a small amount of marginal software will continue beyond July. Implementation and overseeing of contingency arrangements will proceed up to the end of the year. A comprehensive statement of my Department's state of readiness with regard to the year 2000 project has been published on the Department's Internet website.

Regarding Y2K compliance, there is nobody more interested than me in ensuring that those in receipt of social welfare will get the correct payment on 1 January 2000 and not an incorrect one, either more or less. The Department is probably to the fore of all Government Departments in its Y2K compliance procedures but that is as it should be, as it is the Department with most computer systems. My Department was the first to address this matter more than one year ago and recently received a substantial award for the system it set up for Y2K compliance. The award was received in New York by staff from my Department who worked in this area.</P>

      <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy or NAPS was launched in April 1997 with the overall target of reducing the proportion of households in consistent poverty from 9 to 15 per cent to less than 5 to 10 per cent by the year 2007. Targets were also set under five key themes &ndash;  unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> Shortly after taking up office, the Government established a Cabinet committee on social inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, which has helped keep poverty among the issues at the top of our policy agenda. This committee is supported by a senior officials group on social inclusion which was established last year. The NAPS interdepartmental policy committee remains in place, NAPS liaison officers have been appointed in relevant Government Departments and a NAPS unit has been established in my Department to help co-ordinate and develop cross-departmental action to support social inclusion and anti-poverty measures.</P>
    <P>To advance towards achieving the NAPS targets, the Government has undertaken various initiatives relevant to each of the five key theme areas. These include a multi-annual employment action plan aimed at reducing unemployment and preventing young people from drifting into unemployment; a Green Paper on adult education which was published in November 1998; a National Forum on Early Childhood Education held in March 1998 with a White Paper on this topic due to be published this year; cross-departmental groups examining the issues of homelessness and literacy among the unemployed have been established and will report this year; and a pilot programme to provide improved services to families locally was announced this month &ndash; this project, which will commence in the autumn, will build on the one stop shop concept, with the aim of providing improved access to services for families through the social welfare local offices; the integrated services project, which focuses on the specific needs of deprived urban areas, has proceeded to implementation stage; and a White Paper on rural development will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to refer to the latest ESRI Report on Monitoring Poverty Trends, which was issued yesterday. It is evident that substantial progress has been made towards achieving the original NAPS targets. The number of people in consistent poverty has been reduced from 9 to 15 per cent to 7 to 10 per cent, with the NAPS target of 5 to 10 per cent almost achieved. The level of unemployment has been reduced from 11.9 per cent to 6.4 per cent, with the NAPS target of 6 per cent almost achieved. The level of long-term unemployment has been reduced from 7 per cent to 3.1 per cent, already below the NAPS target of 3.5 per cent. The income adequacy target, as defined by the Commission on Social Welfare, has been achieved in full with all social welfare payments now over the target rate.</P>
    <P>In light of these developments and this Government's ongoing social inclusion strategy, I announced the following revised targets: consistent poverty to be reduced to below 5 per cent by 2004; unemployment to be reduced to below 5 per cent by 2002; and long-term unemployment to be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2002. In addition, I have asked the interdepartmental policy committee to examine possibilities for new targets to <Col N="1501" /> reflect the changed environment, for example in relation to education, adult literacy and children in poverty.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this Government is living up to its promise in its programme for Government to &ldquo;halt the continuing drift towards the development of a two-tier society&rdquo; and is achieving positive results.</P>

The last budget was poverty proofed and recently I had discussions with the Minister for Finance on poverty proofing the national development plan and that is on line. The Deputy can take it that all major Government decisions, in effect every Government decision, is poverty proofed. We are to the fore in Europe with regard to poverty proofing from a Government perspective and we hope to push this with other State agencies, including local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for this opportunity to make a statement on what is an important and difficult issue.</P>
      <P>First, our thoughts are with the relatives of the victims at what is an enormously difficult time for them. We earnestly pray that their hopes, which were built up after years of appalling suffering, are not dashed. Second, I wish to record my appreciation, that of the Government and, I am sure, all Members for the professional and sensitive way in which the gardaí are carrying out the difficult duties they have been called on to undertake in the search for the remains of the victims. The Commissioner and members of the force can be rightly proud of the manner in which they have undertaken this onerous task. It is only right too to acknowledge the role played by the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains and its staff in dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>The background to the search for the remains of the missing persons in question is as follows.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 29 March 1999, the Government approved the issuing of a statement concerning an initiative to locate the graves of missing people from Northern Ireland. That statement said that the Government, following indications from Sinn Féin that a genuine effort was being made to locate the graves of missing people, was prepared to facilitate the location of the remains by introducing legislation to the effect that evidence resulting from that process could not be used in the prosecution of offences. The British Government indicated that it would also introduce similar legislation. Very shortly afterwards the Provisional IRA issued a statement to the effect that it had succeeded in locating the remains of nine victims.</P>
      <P>Detailed discussions took place with the UK authorities with a view to putting in place a framework for locating the remains of victims. This culminated in the signing of an agreement between the two Governments on 27 April. The main purpose of the Criminal Justice (Location of Victims' Remains) Act, 1999 was to provide for the independent international Commission, as established under the agreement between the two Governments, to facilitate the location of the remains of victims of paramilitary violence killed prior to 10 April 1998. The legislation provides that evidence resulting from the process of locating the remains of victims cannot be used on behalf of the prosecution in criminal cases. I acknowledge again, the co-operation of all sides of the House in enacting that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> Subsequent to the enactment in this jurisdiction of the Criminal Justice (Location of Victims' Remains) Act, 1999 and equivalent legislation in the UK, the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains was established following an exchange of notes between the British and Irish Governments on 28 May 1999. The Governments appointed to the Commission, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, the Victims Commissioner in the North and the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, who fulfils a similar role in relation to victims in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On 28 May 1999, the day on which the Commission was established, Mr. John Wilson, with the consent of Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>Intermediaries have contacted the Commission and indicated the location of certain graves. The Commission have given the knowledge of locations to the Garda Síochána. They will secure these sites and proceed with the exhumation. There will be a proper scientific presence. Relatives are being informed and will be treated with the utmost sensitivity. The remains will be transported to Dublin where suitable arrangements will be made for relatives.</P>
    <P>Again on 28 May 1999, at approximately 7.30 a.m. the Garda Síochána took possession of a coffin at Old Faughart graveyard, stated to contain the remains of Mr. Éamonn Molloy who has been missing since 1975. In accordance with Section 11 of the legislation, an Order was made directing the coroner for Dublin County Borough to hold an inquest, and the remains were then conveyed to the city morgue, Store Street, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand from the coroner that steps are being taken to verify the identity of the remains and once that process has been completed it will be possible to release the remains to the family for burial. I assure the House that no avoidable delay will occur.</P>
    <P>On 29 and 30 May, Garda secured a further six locations which are stated to contain the remains of a further eight missing persons. The six locations are: Ballydonnel Brook, Ballynultagh, Blessington, County Wicklow; Kilmurray, Castleblayney, County Monaghan; Brogan, Carrickroe, Emyvale, County Monaghan; Templeton beach car park, Carlingford, County Louth; Oristown Bog, Kells, County Meath; and Coghalstown, Wilkinstown, Navan, County Meath.</P>
    <P>The topography of the locations mentioned presents varying degrees of difficulty to the search teams involved. Details of locations are as follows.</P>
    <P>Ballydonnel Brook, Ballynultagh, Blessington, County Wicklow is located five miles from Blessington in the Wicklow mountains. It is a very remote area of bogland covered with gorse, heather and ferns. Work has commenced at this area and a large area has been meticulously excavated down to the bedrock of the mountain without locating any remains. The terrain involved makes the task <Col N="1504" /> extremely difficult, painstaking and time consuming. The remains of Danny McIlhone, missing since 1978, are stated to be at this location.</P>
    <P>Kilmurray, Castleblayney, County Monaghan is a bowl-shaped area of bogland which is extremely difficult to search due to the waterlogged nature of the area. Pumps are being used to drain the location and are pumping 20,000 gallons of water per hour. The meticulous excavation of the site is ongoing and will continue. The remains of Brian McKinney and John McClory, missing since 1978, are stated to be at this location.</P>
    <P>Brogan, Carrickroe, Emyvale, County Monaghan is also an area of peat bog in a mountainous area. The site is being drained using pumps and the Garda search operation is ongoing with the assistance of engineers. The remains of Columba McVeigh, missing since 1975, are stated to be at this location.</P>
    <P>Templeton beach car park, Carlingford, County Louth is adjacent to Templeton beach. An extensive area has been excavated without the remains indicated being located. Meticulous excavation work is continuing at the site. The remains of Jean McConville, missing since 1972, are stated to be at this location.</P>
    <P>Oristown Bog, Kells, County Meath is a peat bog, a large area of which has been cut away for commercial purposes. Excavation of the site is ongoing. The remains of Brendan Megraw, missing since 1978, are stated to be at this location.</P>
    <P>Coghalstown, Wilkinstown, Navan, County Meath is a wooded area with dense undergrowth and wild trees and scrub in a wet and boggy area. This location is being assessed with a view to establishing the most effective approach deploying search teams. The remains of Séamus Wright and Kevin McKee, missing since 1972, are stated to be at this location.</P>
    <P>Work by gardaí is ongoing at each of the six locations. The terrain at all the locations is proving to be a particularly difficult aspect of the search operations. Where possible, the Garda search operations commenced at the point identified as the most likely where remains would be located. The search areas in these instances have since been extended. Gardaí have obtained the services of engineers where this is necessary and the technical expertise from the Garda technical bureau is on hand at each location. Specialised radar equipment has been used to assist in the location of the remains. All resources required to complete the operations succesfully are being used. To date, no remains have been located at any of the six locations.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the availability of resources is not an issue in these operations which are taking place in four counties. The Government is committed to doing everything possible to recover the remains of the missing persons and return them to their families. The Government has taken, and will continue to take every available step to ensure that the remains are located as quickly as possible. I know that in doing this <Col N="1505" /> the Government has the support of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>However, the level of success in locating the remains of the persons in question is dependent on the information which has been made available. While there is no reason to doubt that everyone participating in this process is acting in good faith, we are also aware of the distress and trauma being caused to the families and relatives of these persons arising from the prolonged searches. The Garda Síochána are maintaining close contact with families in all cases and keeping them informed.</P>
    <P>The plight of the relatives of the victims is an especially harrowing one and there can be no doubt that the past few days have been particularly difficult. The relatives never gave up hope over the years that the remains would be recovered and given a proper burial and, even though progress has not been as great as we all would have wished, it would be wrong to lose hope now.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the pain suffered by families of victims in respect of the location of whose remains no information has been furnished. I urge anybody who has information about secret burial places of other victims to make that information available to the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. The pain and suffering endured by all of these families has gone on far too long. The least they deserve is for the remains of their loved ones to be returned to them for a proper burial.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Garda Síochána will investigate any information given them by the Commission in an effort to bring this sorry affair to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said about the victims' relatives and the Garda Síochána. I hope the long purgatory of the victims' relatives will come to an end soon. That their hopes might be dashed is too awful to contemplate. I praise the Garda Síochána for the professional and sensitive way in which they are performing their duties in the gruesome task in which they are involved. The relatives of the disappeared to whom I have spoken would like to thank them for their sensitivity.</P>
      <P>The behaviour of the provisional republican movement in recent days is typical of the barbarity with which it has treated the victims and their relatives over a quarter of a century. The disappeared were murdered by the IRA. In some instances they were tortured and their bodies buried in secret graves. Their relatives were lied to in the most horrible way and rumours spread to take away their good name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purgatory of the relatives has lasted for a quarter of a century but in some respects the agony of recent days has been the worst. They have had to relive their grief. Those of us who have lost near relatives thought at the time of their death that we would never recover so deep was our sense of grief but time heals. With the passage of time we come to terms with their death <Col N="1506" /> and do not remember them every waking moment. In this case there has been no focus for grief and no grave at which to say prayers. To admit that their relatives were dead appeared like betrayal to some. In recent days grief has returned in all its intensity but even in the midst of grief there has been hope that the IRA statement and the designation of the burial sites meant that their trauma was at an end. Apparently their hopes are being dashed. This is cruelty and barbarism at its worst. It ranks large in the annals of infamy.</P>
    <P>The IRA demanded legislation in this House and at Westminster to protect it from the consequences of its murderous deeds as the price of indicating the burial places. We fulfilled our side of the bargain. The majority in this House, the House of Commons and the House of Lords had serious reservations about passing that legislation but we did it as it was the price we were prepared to pay in order that the bodies would be returned and the relatives would be able to give them a Christian burial.</P>
    <P>The IRA has not fulfilled its side of the bargain. The information it has provided so far has proved too vague and imprecise to locate the bodies. The case in which I am most interested is that of Columba McVeigh who came from the village in which I lived before moving South &ndash; Donaghmore, County Tyrone. I have been pursuing the case for 25 years since the Hallowe'en evening he left a flat in this city to buy a packet of cigarettes and never returned. I count his mother, two brothers and a sister as personal friends. His father is deceased.</P>
    <P>The area indicated extends to 3,000 square yards or three-quarters of an acre of bog. It is currently being drained. Why is the information so imprecise? A car park or houses have not been built on it. The only difference is the vegetation. Surely it is possible to be more precise as to where the body is buried.</P>
    <P>In its statement yesterday the IRA cited a change of leadership as one of the reasons for the fiasco and why it had proved difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the bodies. The Minister knows as well as I do that there are individuals in leadership positions in Sinn Féin who were involved in the original decision to murder those now described as the disappeared, to hide their bodies and thus deprive them of a Christian burial, to lie to their relatives and to impugn their good name. They have a responsibility to identify the burial places accurately. If they do not know where they are buried, they know those who do. They should tell us exactly where the bodies are buried.</P>
    <P>There is a chain of command in the IRA in these matters. Secret burials required a decision at the top of that organisation. The so-called execution of informers also requires a decision at the top. There is a person towards the top of the chain of command designated to take decisions in these matters. The person currently responsible is <Col N="1507" /> often seen on our television screens. He knows more about this than what we have been told.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the disappeared contrasts with the IRA's attitude to its dead and the respect it demands from others for them. We know about the funerals, the graveside orations, commemorations and the great symbols of martyrdom. The National Graves Association looks after the graves. That is the way it honours, reveres and uses its dead. If the British Army, the RUC or loyalists were responsible for kidnapping, torturing and murdering republicans &ndash; even ordinary Catholics &ndash; and burying them in secret graves, what would be the attitude of the republican movement?</P>
    <P>Remember the attitude towards bodies during the hunger strikes. We were told the bodies of the hunger strikers were temples of the Holy Ghost with which there could not be interference. That contrasts very starkly with the way they have treated the bodies of the &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo;. It also contrasts very starkly with the way in which they booby trapped the bodies of their victims on occasions in order to blow up members of the security forces.</P>
    <P>Gerry Adams had the effrontery to tell us that this was about human rights and justice. I find that stomach churning hypocrisy. Ed Moloney in the<i> Sunday Tribune </i>described the issue of the &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; as the most shameful episode in the history of the IRA. He said far from being about the restoration of human rights, it is an issue the republican movement, Sinn Féin included, has exploited for selfish political reasons. I agree with that sentiment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy Ó Caoláin, is not present, although I am not surprised. I have noted that on all occasions of this nature when serious questions are being asked of the republican movement, including Sinn Féin, he is never present. He comes into the House on occasions, pontificates to us and preaches about our responsibilities, particularly those of the British and Irish Governments, but he is never here when he might be asked serious questions and when he might contribute to our knowledge of events.</P>
    <P>This is an issue for which the republican movement has no-one to blame but itself. They are wonderful people at placing the blame on other people's shoulders. They are particularly good at blaming the British, and Lord help us, the British have been responsible for many things over the years for which we can blame them. They are very good at blaming the loyalists and if it is possible to blame the Unionists for the loyalists, on to their shoulders the blame will go. They will blame this Government and would have blamed our Government given the opportunity. This time the blame is on themselves. They murdered these innocent people, hid their bodies and refused to disclose sufficient information. This is a challenge to them, not to the British, the loyalists or to the Irish or the British Governments. They have a <Col N="1508" /> responsibility to answer the questions being posed to them and to accept the full responsibility for the situation we are now in.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister a number of questions, but will not be too specific in them. I do not wish to cause any embarrassment or to push things too far. There may be things about which the Minister is not in a position to tell us, and on this one occasion I will excuse him if he believes he should not be fully forthcoming to the House in these matters. A question many people are asking is, of the six sites which have been designated for the eight victims &ndash; there were two double graves &ndash; why has there not been success in any of them? One would have expected that there would have been some success in at least one. If the bodies are there, why has there not been some success so far? Why does the Minister believe the information provided has been so imprecise? It is almost as if they were reluctant, although we know they were reluctant and were forced to provide information.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a known republican about this matter. He describes himself as a traditional republican &ndash; more Real IRA than Provisional IRA. He said they should not have given any information until the war was over and Ireland is united. That was his attitude to disclosure of this information. Does the Minister believe there is an element of that involved? Does it result from the spilt in the IRA, particularly in south Armagh where those who would know more about it than others happen to be disciplined republicans and are not, therefore, prepared to give the necessary information? Does it have anything to do with the fact they wish to hold this threat for future occasions because the way in which the bodies have been treated is considered to be a deterrent to others who wish to &ldquo;inform&ldquo;? Do they wish to avoid the torture of victims being exposed? What about the other seven victims, some of whom are from south Armagh? We should not accept that the IRA has responsibility for only nine victims. The IRA clearly has responsibility for others, but it has not been prepared to accept that. Perhaps the Minister will give us his views on those questions.</P>
    <P>I expressed some scepticism on Second Stage of the Bill and said I would not believe it until I stood in Donaghmore graveyard and saw the body of Columba McVeigh lowered into the grave having been satisfied by DNA testing or whatever, that it really was his body. That scepticism, if anything, has increased since Second Stage. We are now in a position that we will probably have to shame the IRA and Sinn Féin into making proper disclosures and giving proper identification. If the speech I make contributes to that, it will be a good thing. All of us should shame them into so doing.</P>
    <P>The deep anger and frustration I feel about this matter is felt more strongly and intensely by the relatives, and I know it is also shared by the Minister. I assure him that in any efforts he makes in this House, he will have our support, particularly in keeping the Garda on this job, as they wish to <Col N="1509" /> remain until the last lingering hope has ended, and in giving them the necessary material to do this job until we achieve success in locating the bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to the request made this morning by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, that we should have a short debate this afternoon on the position regarding the search for the bodies of that group of victims of paramilitary violence known as the &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo;. I am also grateful to the Minister for making himself available to make a statement to the House and respond to the debate at short notice.</P>
      <P>Given the dreadful ordeal which the families of the disappeared have had to face yet again this week, it would have been unforgivable for the Dáil to have adjourned for more than one week without having the opportunity to hear a report from the Minister on the progress of the search to date and without affording us the opportunity to express our sympathy and solidarity with the families concerned and for us to jointly, as the Parliament of the Irish people, to exert whatever pressure we can on anyone who has knowledge of the location of these bodies and to press them to pass it on to the authorities without another moment's delay.</P>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech depressing and upsetting, as I suppose everybody else did, including the Minister. It was depressing and upsetting to listen to the details of the lonely, isolated sites where men and women were placed having been murdered and abandoned. In more than 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland the paramilitary organisations have been responsible for appalling acts, mass murder, sectarian killings, the murder of children and mutilations. However, there can be few acts which can compare with the sheer cruelty and callousness of the IRA in regard to the disappeared. It is in no way to diminish the suffering of those who have endured the loss of a loved one killed or maimed in Northern Ireland to say that the relatives of those who were murdered and whose bodies have never been found have had to carry a particularly unspeakable burden of ongoing grief and pain, something Deputy Currie spoke about very succinctly.</P>
      <P>All of us have suffered family bereavements and there is a consolation in going through the process of bereavement and grief, burial, prayer, remembrance and the periodic visitation to the place of rest. Those who know anything about death and dying must be aware that grieving and burial are essential parts of the process of trying to cope with loss. Other people who have lost family members, even in the most shocking circumstances, have been able to at least do that. The families of the disappeared have been denied even that small modicum of comfort and have been put through an ongoing ordeal which in some cases has continued for almost 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among those kidnapped, spirited away from their families, in some cases certainly tortured, <Col N="1510" /> murdered and buried in secret were teenage boys, middle-aged men and a Protestant mother of ten. The only thing they had in common was to offend in some way against the vicious regime that the IRA inflicted upon Nationalist communities in Northern Ireland for most of the 1970s and 1980s. Over the past 30 years members of the republican movement were quick and eager to complain against breaches of human rights by the security forces, in many cases justifiably so, but what respect was shown for the human or civil rights of those taken from their homes, brought before some kangaroo court or other, dealt with without the benefit of anyone to defend them and executed without the benefit of right of appeal or comfort of a Christian burial?</P>
    <P>With the declaration of the ceasefires by the paramilitary organisations, the evolution of the peace process and the progress made on a range of issues, rightly helped by all political parties in the State, we developed legislative measures, advanced the release of paramilitary prisoners, reopened Border roads and generally started the demilitarisation process. In that context it was understandable, indeed inevitable, that the plight of the disappeared would again come to the fore among our considerations as an issue we have to address before we put an end to the appalling suffering of the peoples of this island. We may all have been guilty from time to time of allowing the disappeared to slip from our attention, but their families never forgot them, gave up on them or ceased to have a yearning to give their loved ones the benefit of a decent burial.</P>
    <P>It was largely as a result of the pressure maintained by the families that the republican movement, having ignored them for so long and in many cases having lied to them for more than 20 years, was at last forced to act. The announcement by the IRA that it was willing to identify the location of the remains of the disappeared was welcome, although it was neither total nor unconditional. Not all those kidnapped and murdered by the IRA were included in the list &ndash; a number of victims from south Armagh were particularly noticeable by their absence. Of course, the price society has had to pay to bring about the return of these remains was to give a guarantee that any forensic evidence recovered in the search would not be used to bring anyone to account for these brutal murders. We debated that price in the House. Reservations were expressed and I think it was with a heavy heart that we agreed to pay that price to bring about an end to the sufferings of the families concerned.</P>
    <P>We all know now that the suffering of the families has not yet ended. Either through callousness or carelessness, the IRA has subjected the families to new levels of cruelty. Last Saturday the family of Jean McConville, who was snatched from her ten fatherless children and murdered in 1972 simply because she showed some sympathy and consideration for a British soldier who had been shot on her doorstep, went to Templeton beach in County Louth expecting at last to wit<Col N="1511" /> ness the recovery of their mother's body. Five days later they are still waiting, with the recovery of their mother's remains apparently no nearer. The families of other victims have watched searches in counties Wicklow, Monaghan and Meath with a similar sense of disbelief and a growing sense of anger and betrayal. I cannot believe that there are not people who know the precise location of the remains of at least some of these unfortunate victims. Even if the IRA as an organisation refuses to do anything more, there may be people no longer involved in the republican movement who deeply regret the acts of barbarism in which they may have been involved decades ago who have some information which would help the families locate these bodies. I appeal to those people to come forward, through intermediaries or anonymously if necessary, to help bring an end to the agony of these families.</P>
    <P>I know the Garda have put in great efforts over the past few days in trying to find the bodies, and I join with other speakers in thanking and supporting them in their difficult task. However, they are clearly acting on the basis of incomplete information and operating in extraordinarily difficult terrain. Does the Minister consider that the number of personnel involved in the search is sufficient? Has consideration been given to increasing the number of personnel, for example, through involving the Army? Is the Minister satisfied that the technical equipment available to the Garda is totally adequate? Has he considered the provision of assistance to the Garda from police forces abroad who may have particular relevant experience of similar searches in other countries? I accept and welcome the Minister's comments regarding resources. However, can the Minister again reassure the House that everything that can be done will be done and that neither time nor cost will be a consideration in bringing an end to the pain and suffering of these most unfortunate families? What efforts have been made through the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains to secure more accurate information in recent days? Have the political representatives of the Republican movement been called in and warned of the consequences of inflicting further suffering on these families? I join in the remarks of regret that the elected representative of the Republican movement in this House is not here to participate in this debate.</P>

    <P>I know that all parties in the House will want to express their total solidarity with the families of the disappeared in the awful ordeal which they have had to endure for so long and which has, in many respects, intensified in the past five days. The courage, determination and, above all, dig<Col N="1512" /> nity with which they have conducted themselves is in stark contrast to the cowardly, cynical and dishonest approach of the IRA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Currie and Howlin for their contributions to this important debate. While there is no doubt that everybody in this House wishes to see all of the remains recovered, equally there is no doubt that the terrain being searched is extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie referred to the late Columba McVeigh. I suppose his comments could be said to illustrate most startlingly the pain being suffered by all the families concerned in this horrific affair.</P>
      <P>We all hope that further and more precise information would be made available to the commission to enable it to get on with its work successfully. That said, at two of the sites, Carlingford and Blessington, there was some precision in relation to the location of the graves but, unfortunately, nothing has been found at the precise points to date.</P>
      <P>I am still satisfied about the good faith of people involved in this particular process but I renew the appeal that if there is information available to anybody which would be of further assistance, then it should be made available at this point in time.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the families and those meetings were harrowing and heart-rending. One could not but have the deepest sympathy for the families involved. There was a palpable sense of hope among the families who were led to believe that their loved ones would be located in the not too distant future. There was, equally, a great sense of hopelessness and a deep sense of pain among those whose loved ones were not identified at that point. The human suffering, trauma and stress which has been caused in this dreadful matter cannot be gauged.</P>
      <P>It is of considerable importance that we continue with the search. It is fair to say that if bodies were buried, for example, in remote locations in the dead of night it would present some difficulty to the identification of the precise locations. Nonetheless, it is true that the suffering which human beings are going through at present is horrendous. If, as I say, there are people who can be of assistance by the furnishing further information, then it is something which should be done immediately. In addition, if there are people who have information on the whereabouts of remains which have not yet been identified, I ask them, as a matter of humanity, to furnish the information to the commission. The suffering which the families have been and are enduring is appalling and it clearly has been accentuated by recent events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to whether or not, in Deputy Currie's words, there is a split, whether it is being used as a threat for the future or whether people are trying to hide the fact that their victims were tortured, my view is that those taking part in the <Col N="1513" /> process are acting in good faith. I have no reason whatsoever to believe otherwise at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked whether the numbers and resources involved are sufficient and whether outside help should be sought. The Garda has engaged the resources and manpower required for the exercise. It has also specified the equipment which it requires. In so far as the Garda requires anything, I can assure Deputy Howlin that the Government is co-operating in providing everything that is being sought. It is our profound wish that the operation would be a success in all respects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked whether the Taoiseach or the Government had met Sinn Féin on the matter. The Taoiseach has, as the Deputy may be taware, been in contact with the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Adams, and they both expressed the hope that the victims would be located.</P>
    <P>It is important to record that what we have seen in the past few days must remind us of the dark years and will surely serve to concentrate the minds of those tasked with securing an acceptable conclusion in the impasse over decommissioning, which is the remaining obstacle to achieving new institutions and a new beginning. If the images on our television screens over the past few days can help to reinforce the resolve of those determined to pursue politics in a peaceful and democratic way, it may well prove to be the case that these deaths may not have been in vain.</P>
    <P>I have said that those members of families who have lost loved ones have not lost hope over the years of the possibility of their remains being located. It is important at this time that we continue to hope that the ongoing searches will be successful. I stress that while searches have commenced at all locations, searches have not been completed at any location. I assure both Deputies and the House that these searches will continue down to the last lingering hope. We are determined to try to find these bodies so that they may have a humane and Christian burial and also so that those who were horrifically bereaved will have a place to grieve and will be able to be satisfied in their own minds that their loved ones have at last been located. It can be said that the return of victims' remains represents some recognition of the hurt and suffering caused to the victims, their families and society as a whole although it cannot be sufficient.</P>
    <P>On whether I believe the IRA is playing games or is engaged in some form of subterfuge on this matter, I have no reason to doubt the good faith of everyone involved in seeking an end to this terrible business. If people have additional information in this regard, I urge them to come forward with it as a matter of humanity.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give the force of law in the State to the Hague Convention of 1996 on the Protection of Children. The Bill provides a framework within which effect is given to the provisions of the convention in their application to the State. The convention, when in force, will determine what civil law should apply in cases of guardianship, custody of, and access to, children who have links with the jurisdiction of two or more contracting states. The convention will also determine what court should exercise jurisdiction in such cases. The convention results from the work of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Many Deputies will be aware of the work of that conference which has led to, for example, the Hague convention on the private international law aspects of child abduction.</P>
      <P>Since ratification of that convention in 1991 by the State, my Department has operated a central authority for the purpose of applications for the return of children who are abducted into or out of the State by a parent. The convention of 1996 will, in some respects, supplement the convention on child abductions but its scope is a good deal wider because it deals generally with co-operation in respect of matters of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children and it deals in those areas with jurisdiction, applicable law and recognition and enforcement of judgments. We live in a world of increasing mobility. The custodial and other interests of children need to be protected in an environment where children, for one reason or other, are moved by a parent or parents from one jurisdiction to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> There is increasing awareness of the international aspects of the law as it relates to children and a recognition that conflicts of jurisdiction between the authorities of different states may not be in the best interests of children. The best examples are custody disputes where parents are residing in different jurisdictions and apply separately to the courts in those jurisdictions for a determination on the matter. As a result, conflicting judgments may emanate from each court on the issues involved. The convention addresses this long-standing problem by setting out clear and uniform rules to be applied in such cases in all contracting states and it provides for the speedy and effective recognition and enforcement of judgments in those states.</P>
    <P>Since some understanding of the provisions in the convention is a prerequisite to an understanding of the provisions in the Bill, I propose to outline the main provisions of the convention before dealing with the Bill. The full text of the convention is scheduled, for ease of reference, to the Bill. I might also mention that there exists an explanatory report on the convention as published by the Hague Conference. Copies of that report, known as the Lagarde report, have been made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Chapters I to V contain the main provisions of the convention. Chapter I sets out its general scope. The convention applies to children up to the age of 18 years and is concerned with &ldquo;measures directed to the protection of the person or property of a child&rdquo;. The view of the Hague Conference was that, since measures of protection vary with each legal system, any enumeration of those measures could only be in terms of examples. Consequently, the convention gives a non-exhaustive list of the measures to which it relates. In general terms, it applies to measures related to guardianship, custody and child care. It does not apply to matters such as determination of parentage, adoption, maintenance, succession, social welfare or health.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of the convention deals with jurisdiction and lays down a basic rule, namely, that the authorities in the contracting state where the child habitually resides should exercise jurisdiction in matters of guardianship, custody and child care. This was regarded during negotiations on the convention as providing the most realistic basis for determining jurisdiction taking into account the child's interests and the availability of relevant evidence. In the event, for example, of the unlawful removal of a child, the convention ensures that the first state retains jurisdiction over the child and it restricts the means by which the second state can acquire such a jurisdiction. This is particularly important by reference to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction and ensures that that convention can continue to operate as successfully as it has done up to now.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made in the convention in relation to courts which have competence to determine an application for divorce, annulment <Col N="1516" /> or judicial separation and where one of the parents and his or her child does not have habitual residence in the jurisdiction. This might arise, for example, where an Irish court was seized of a divorce application in a case where the applicant is habitually resident in the State but the respondent and a child are resident in another contracting state. The view taken by the Hague Conference was that it ought to be possible, from the point of view of convenience and cost for both parents, where they both accept the jurisdiction of the divorce court, for issues concerning the welfare of the child to be dealt with by the one court. Jurisdiction to take such measures may, under the convention, only be exercised where it is in the best interests of the child and it ceases as soon as the divorce proceedings have been finalised.</P>
    <P>The potential role of other states with which the child may have a substantial connection is also recognised, but in a subsidiary capacity. Thus, for example, the authorities of a state of which the child is a national, if they believe that in a particular case they are better placed to assess the child's best interests, may request the authorities of the child's habitual residence to authorise them to take appropriate measures of protection. Indeed, the authorities of the habitual residence of the child may themselves initiate the transfer mechanism if they think it appropriate. The convention also allows the authorities of any state in whose territory the child, or property belonging to the child, is present to take measures in cases of urgency or to take provisional measures of protection, subject to the competence thereafter of the authorities who would normally have jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of the convention sets out the law to be applied by courts when taking measures of protection. The basic rule is that the relevant judicial or administrative authorities should apply their own law but with sufficient flexibility to allow such authorities to take account of other relevant laws where the protection of the child or his or her property so requires. The convention provides that the law of the child's habitual residence be applied to the question of whether parental responsibility has arisen by operation of law or by agreement. If there is a change in the child's habitual residence, any such existing parental responsibility continues to be effective, but the law of the new habitual residence will determine whether any additional parental responsibility is attributed.</P>
    <P>The thrust of Chapter IV of the convention is that measures taken in one contracting state for the protection of a child or a child's property must, subject to conditions, be recognised in all other contracting states. Those measures will become enforceable as if they had been taken by the authorities of the state in which enforcement is sought. The basic principle here is that a measure relating to the protection of a child should not cease to have effect merely because a border between contracting states has been <Col N="1517" /> crossed. The guardian of a child whose parents are deceased, for example, should not have to go to the expense and trouble of obtaining a new order in the second state to satisfy the authorities there. Recognition and enforcement may be refused, however, in certain circumstances. These include lack of jurisdiction in the state of origin, breaches of considerations of natural justice or grounds of public policy and any interested party may apply to the court for a decision on the recognition, non-recognition or enforcement of a measure where difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>Chapter V requires contracting states to designate a central authority to co-operate with other central authorities for the purposes of the convention. A central authority's functions will include facilitating communications and offers of assistance between courts and administrative authorities in different contracting states, facilitating agreed solutions for the protection of a child's person or property in cases to which the Convention applies and, at the request of a competent authority, providing assistance in discovering the whereabouts of a child who may be present in its territory and in need of protection. Such co-operation has been singularly successful in the context of the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. Some 53 countries have acceded to that convention.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 contains some standard definitions. Deputies should note that particular definitions are given to the words &ldquo;decision&rdquo;, &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; and &ldquo;measure&rdquo;. These are necessary because the convention will apply to court judgments and to decisions made, for example, by health boards under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The main provision is section 2, which gives the force of law to the convention and provides that judicial notice shall be taken of it. These are standard provisions in Bills of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a technical provision dealing with the application of the convention in the State. The terms &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; are used throughout the convention. In some contexts they mean courts in the State, whereas in other contexts they mean administrative agencies concerned with the protection of children. Subsection (2)(a) transposes such references in various articles of the convention, in so far as they apply to courts, into references to the appropriate court in the State. Paragraphs (b) to (d) provide for the manner in which the District Court is to exercise jurisdiction in certain matters in respect of which it did not previously exercise jurisdiction. Paragraph (b) provides for the manner in which the District Court is to exercise jurisdiction in the recognition or enforcement of a measure taken in another contracting state, and paragraph (c) provides that a measure in respect of which an order has been made shall, to the extent to which recognition or enforcement is authorised, be of the same force and effect as if the measure was an order of the District Court. Paragraph (d) is also of interest because it provides for the manner in <Col N="1518" /> which the District Court is to give its opinion on the suitability of a parent to exercise access to a child who does not habitually reside in the State, on the application of a parent who resides in the State. This is provided for in article 35.2 of the convention. That article reflects the view that it is the authorities in the state where the parent resides who are in the best position to gather information on the suitability of a parent to exercise access rights.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2)(e) makes clear that the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; in section 2 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, includes the father of a child who has, by virtue of article 16 of the convention, acquired parental responsibility by operation of the law of another state. Article 16 provides that where a person has acquired parental responsibility by operation of law in the state of the child's habitual residence, without the intervention of the relevant judicial or administrative authority, it subsists after a change in the child's habitual residence. The maintenance of some continuity and certainty in this area is regarded, under the convention, as being in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) paragraphs (f) and (g) allow for the fact that the State may reserve to the jurisdiction of its authorities the power to take measures directed to the protection of the property of a child in the State and not to recognise any measure taken abroad that is incompatible with any measure taken by authorities in the State. These reservations are permissible under article 55 of the convention.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the principle that the law which should apply to measures for the protection of a child should be the law of the country in which a child habitually resides, paragraph (h) provides that, subject to Article 52 which relates to agreements between contracting states on matters governed by the convention, any enactment or rule of law which confers jurisdiction on a court otherwise than in accordance with the convention shall cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 8 provide for standard matters of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court and the District Court for the purposes of applications under the convention in the State. Section 5 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the relevant judgments of courts of other contracting states concerning the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>Where cases having an international dimension are concerned, it will be of importance that a court is seized of all relevant material relating to a child who is the subject of proceedings in that court. Accordingly, sections 6 and 7 deal with the provision of documents and evidence in court proceedings for the purposes of the convention.</P>
    <P>A court in the State may, by virtue of section 8, address letters of request for the purposes of articles 8 and 9 of the convention to courts or similar authorities in other contracting states. The court may do so either directly or with the assistance of the central authority that is proposed to be established in the State for the purpose of the convention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> Section 9 implements that part of the convention which requires contracting states to designate a central authority to promote co-operation among competent authorities to achieve the purposes of the convention. That section, which authorises the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by order, to appoint a central authority, is based on provisions which already apply to the Central Authority for International Child Abduction and the Central Authority for Maintenance Recovery which are operating successfully in my Department.</P>
    <P>By virtue of section 10, the central authority under the 1996 convention will have authority, if requested, to provide information to the competent authority of another contracting state under articles 31, 32 or 34. It may require a probation and welfare officer, a health board or the registrar or clerk of any court to which a written report relating to a child has been sent to provide information on the child. It will also have authority to require any public office holder or body to provide it with any information which would assist in discovering the whereabouts of a child. A corresponding power is proposed in section 17 for the Central Authority for Child Abductions.</P>
    <P>Article 26 of the convention requires states to apply a simple and rapid procedure to applications for enforcement of orders under the convention and, accordingly, section 11 provides for the making of rules of court to provide for the expeditious hearing of proceedings under the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a saving provision which makes clear that nothing in the Bill shall affect the application in the State of the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, which gives the force of law in the State to the Hague and Council of Europe conventions on child abduction. When a child has been wrongfully removed from one jurisdiction to another, the priority will remain that of ensuring his or her immediate return, and it will only be after this return that other measures of protection may be pursued. Section 12 also makes clear that nothing in the Act shall affect the existing jurisdiction of the Irish courts to take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of a child, who is not habitually resident in a contracting state, except where the convention specifically governs the taking of such measures, for example, in cases of urgency. The jurisdiction of the courts in the recognition, enforcement or non-recognition of measures taken in non-contracting states will remain similarly unaffected.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of a Bill which is, at its heart, child centred and reflects international concern at the increasing incidence of parental conflict relating to children who may be the subject of decisions or proceedings in different jurisdictions. Lengthy and protracted court hearings as to forum and jurisdiction are not in the best interests of children and the convention attempts to minimise those problems. The con<Col N="1520" /> vention is of recent origin and states are in the process of preparing for membership of it. The House will agree that we should be to the forefront in this matter. The Bill will enable the State to ratify the convention. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which enables the State to ratify the 1996 Hague Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures of protection for children.</P>
      <P>The Bill will give the convention the force of law in this State. The convention and the Bill will give effect to the treaty on the subject of custody jurisdiction while masquerading as a general welfare statute. The Bill and the convention do not apply to persons over 18 years of age, nor do they apply to paternity or to decisions on adoption, social security, general public welfare measures, criminal matters or asylum and emigration. It may deal with it but it does not state exclusively that it will deal with attribution, exercise, determination or restriction of parental responsibility. The convention states that it will deal with the rights of custody, relocation and visitation in so far as they are international. It does not deal with guardianship, foster replacement and matters relating to children's property.</P>
      <P>The treaty gives jurisdiction over custody to the country of the child's &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo;. If the habitual residence changes, jurisdiction changes and for those children such as refugees, who have no habitual residence, the country in which they are located will have jurisdiction. The treaty allows countries to defer jurisdiction exercised and transfer jurisdiction to other signatory countries. It suggests that such countries might be those where the child has nationality, those in which there is a divorce case pending between the child's parents, or those in which the child has a &ldquo;substantial connection&rdquo;. Before accepting jurisdiction, the new country is required to consider whether accepting the child would be in its best interests.</P>
      <P>The country in which the child is present is allowed to take the necessary measures in urgent cases. Those measures would be of a provisional character and have a territorial effect limited to the countries making the decision. These temporary measures must lapse as soon as the habitual residence country has taken its own necessary measures. A country is supposed to apply its own laws but may, in exceptional cases, apply the laws of another country which has a substantial connection with the child.</P>
      <P>Recognition of other countries' decrees is required and may be refused only if they are not based on jurisdiction or concepts similar to those of the treaty or if the prior proceedings gave no opportunity for the child to be heard in violation of the fundamental principle of procedures of the requested state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> The rights of parents are outlined. There is provision for refusing recognition on the request of any person claiming a measure infringed his or her parental responsibility, if that measure was taken without that parent being given an opportunity to be heard. Recognition can also be refused if it is manifestly contrary to public policy of the former country, taking the best interests of the child into account.</P>
    <P>Child abduction is a growing problem in Europe. Increased mobility has resulted in more transnational marriages, more transnational marriage breakdown and more transnational child custody disputes. Faced with complex and lengthy court proceedings, or with the prospect of losing a custody battle in another country, some parents simply abduct children of broken marriages. In 1997, there were 123 abductions, 50 per cent were into this State and 50 per cent out of the State. The majority of children abducted from the State were taken to England or Wales. Intermarriages between Irish and UK citizens account for the majority of cases. Most abducted children of separated parents are taken out of the country by one parent without the consent of the other.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the abduction of children is a growing problem and one which has been, perhaps, made easier by the removal of travel restrictions between the 15 member states of the EU. The main difficulty is the delay in dealing with cases in courts outside this jurisdiction. The longer the delay the more difficult the situation. If a case takes more than nine months to come to court and the child is very young, it will be argued that the child has lived for as long in the country to which it has been abducted as it did in the country in which custody is being sought. The basic principle of the Hague Convention is that the residence of the child is decided in the country in which the child habitually resides. However, cases are purposely delayed until an argument is created that the child resides in the country into which it has been abducted.</P>
    <P>The problem in most countries is that many judges are not informed in the area of child abduction and may come across only one such case in their professional lives. This is not the case in Ireland and Britain where High Court judges are familiar with the issues and how these cases should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises when a parent from another country, bringing a case in our courts to return a child to its homeland, gives a commitment which he or she has no intention of living up to. People often fail to live up to undertakings to properly cater for children and many judicial systems in the country of origin do not have the rule of law to enforce these undertakings. In a case before Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness in November 1998 an Italian father sued for the return of his daughter. On their return to Italy the child was immediately placed in an orphanage <Col N="1522" /> because of its circumstances and was left there for a year.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, Europe has experienced problems in applying the Hague Convention. The main problems are the slowness of procedures, the lack of free legal aid in some countries, and the use of exceptional clauses. The implementation of appeals procedures should be fast and almost automatic. Lawyers and judges are often unfamiliar with procedures as they rarely deal with cases of child abduction.</P>
    <P>Interpol figures for 1996 showed that 60 children reported missing in the EU had not been traced. The development and enlargement of the Union will require that member states co-operate on family issues. The Interpol figures greatly understate the scale of the problem. They cover only criminal abductions while abductions by parents are excluded. US figures indicate that in 1995, 367,000 children under 16 years of age were missing. Many of these children are abducted by a parent, others run away or live with another family member, and some are injured and die. A small number are taken by paedophiles and are never found.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Mary Banotti, MEP, the European mediator on the abduction of children, for her excellent work in this area. The number of children missing in the EU is unknown. At one point, Interpol said the figure was 60, at another it claimed it was 200. The truth is that it does not have a clue of the number. The Marc Detroux case in Belgium shows that an abducted child can be taken out of a country in ten minutes, thus highlighting the need for co-operation. The European agency that deals with the trafficking of drugs and people should be given responsibility for missing children.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of abduction. For instance, a couple who lived in Cork went to Spain on holidays with their children, including two from the woman's previous marriage. The man suggested that his partner stay in Spain for an extra week with the children from her previous marriage while he returned to Cork with their four year old twins. When the mother returned to Ireland she found that her partner had left for the south of France with the children.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the presentation by the Irish delegation to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva this year, that the Government has no co-ordinated policy on children and child care. On taking office, the Taoiseach fragmented responsibility for a variety of children's services among a retinue of Ministers and Ministers of State and re-erected the political and bureaucratic obstacles to reform removed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>When appointed Minister of State with responsibility for child care services and children's legislation in 1994, Deputy Currie took full responsibility for all legislation dealing with children. It is ironic that, under pressure at the hearing in Geneva, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, announced that the Government <Col N="1523" /> would once again appoint a Minister with sole responsibility for children's affairs. She also stated, under pressure, that the issue of an ombudsman for children would be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Over the past seven years a plethora of reports have recommended the implementation of the proposals, including the appointment of an ombudsman, yet the Government procrastinates. Our children are the most precious part of our society. The motto of the Childrens' Rights Alliance states: &ldquo;A country is judged on how it treats its children&rdquo;. Our children are the future leaders, educators, carers, providers and princes of industry and commerce. The State stands indicted in its attitude to them. The Government reacts to specific situations rather than viewing children as people with rights, including the right to a safe childhood. The recent response to the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; documentary was a reaction rather than a planned approach to dealing with children's issues.</P>
    <P>Children are not being consulted. In the report of the UN committee on the rights of the child it was pointed out that the welfare policies and practices in Ireland do not adequately reflect the child's rights as enshrined in the convention on children. In addition, the committee was concerned that enough emphasis was not placed on measures of a preventative nature. Can the Minister say if work has now been completed on the outcome of this section of the report?</P>
    <P>There has been much social change in the past 20 years. We have seen the greater involvement of women in employment, which is welcome. There is no doubt that the growth of the Celtic tiger economy is in no small way due to the involvement of women in employment outside the home. This has changed and affected the family and family life. The old community and family support which existed in the past has disappeared in both urban and rural areas. There is not the same support for the family in society.</P>
    <P>There is also a disappearance of support from the extended family. In previous times, a member of a family had access not only to his parents and siblings but also to his grandparents, uncles, aunts and first cousins. They were regarded as part of the family. A society has now evolved in which the nuclear family proliferates. Most children are reared with little access to close relatives other than their parents. This has led to fewer facilities for children to communicate their difficulties, stresses and concerns outside their immediate family circle.</P>
    <P>That change has resulted in a growing awareness of the need to reconcile family life with work opportunities. The State has a duty to reconcile the competing demands of work and family. The rearing conditions and education of children is vital for future generations and parents must always have a key role in that.</P>
    <P>Irish society has changed immensely. One in five children is now born to a single mother. We must urgently examine and legislate for the role <Col N="1524" /> of the father in a changing society. The State does not facilitate single fathers who wish to fulfil their role, obligations and responsibilities as parents. Single parents, as of right, should have an entitlement to a relationship with their child or children. To date, the presumption in law is that single fathers do not have a right and must seek agreement to obtain that right. The law facilitates the rights of the mother to access to and rearing of the children but hinders the role of the single father in fulfilling his rights and obligations.</P>
    <P>Custody or guardianship cannot be arranged without it first being agreed by the mother. The State does not facilitate a single father in establishing guardianship or joint guardianship without the mother's agreement. Under the law at present, children of single parents are discriminated against in their relationship with their fathers compared with children of married parents, the relationship having an inferior status in the eyes of the law and of society.</P>
    <P>There must be a comprehensive examination of the role of the father in a changing society. It is important that a child has knowledge of and the influence of a father and the acquaintance and friendship of his or her father's family. That is a right the State should uphold.</P>
    <P>While progress has been made with regard to the recognition of children who are not born within marriage, through the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy, we must continue to recognise that families are now very different from those of the past. If we continue to promote the principle that parentage is, in effect, solely tied up with marriage, particularly in the case of fathers, we are not recognising the needs of the child or children, those of the parents or the manner in which society is reshaping itself.</P>
    <P>The law must reflect the reality of life today. Traditionally, fathers had enormous control in families and mothers were, in effect, dependent on them. This principle has long been changed to good effect. It has now been turned on its head whereby fathers are now dependent on mothers for access and to have a relationship with their children. It is not acceptable that it is solely in the gift of the mother to grant guardianship to the father of her child.</P>
    <P>At present, the right of the mother is absolute with regard to guardianship issues. She can agree to the unmarried father being the guardian and, if she does so, the procedure can be completed easily. However, the role of the father is not sufficiently developed and recognised. I am not happy with a society where so many women are rearing children on their own and where the fathers of those children are missing, either because they do not want to know their children or because they have been prevented from knowing them. This is an issue that must be addressed by society and its legislators.</P>
    <P>It takes two people to have a baby and rear a child. The responsibilities and rights of fatherhood have not been addressed where the parents of the child are single. We must include fathers <Col N="1525" /> in such a way that they are established as having rights and are challenged to take responsibility. If we fail to do this, we will simply reinforce a pattern that will not be good for society or for individuals who have the rights and responsibilities of parents regardless of whether they are married.</P>
    <P>It is not in a child's best interest, unless there is a compelling reason otherwise, not to know and have a relationship with his father. The father should recognise the relationship and be involved in the parenting of a child. The overriding consideration in any marriage breakdown appears to be the convenience of the parents rather than the best interests of the children.</P>
    <P>We cannot overestimate the importance of a father figure in a child's life. There is a void in the lives of children who do not have a father figure. More than 80 per cent of primary school teachers are female. This means that children who are being brought up by single mothers do not have any influential male figure in their lives. This will have consequences for them in later years.</P>
    <P>We must face reality. Given that 2,500 children were born in Ireland to unmarried parents in 1997 and 700 applications were made by unmarried fathers for guardianship of their children, we must seriously examine what it is in our culture that determines that the majority of fathers of children born outside marriage do not have a relationship with them. We must consider how to ensure that children of unmarried parents or children of marriages which break down have the most stable relationship possible with both their parents.</P>
    <P>Society and the State must recognise that a family is automatically created when a child is born, regardless of whether the parents are in a relationship. Both parents have an obligation to take an active part in the upbringing of the children and the law should facilitate, not inhibit, this. Children have a right to the protection of both parents although there will always be exceptional circumstances. Children have a right to access to their extended families. They have the right to know both their parents' names and to have those names on their birth certificates. Children should have a right of access to both parents. They should have access to all elements of their family trees, including genealogy and medical information.</P>
    <P>Society and the State should support mothers and fathers equally, for the benefit of the community, in seeking to be equally involved in the shared parenting of their children both within relationships and marriage and through the promotion of the concept of joint custody of the children as a normal expectation in the cases of separation and relationship breakdown.</P>
    <P>The State should establish the quality and dignity of both mothers and fathers in the parenting of their children. It should also promote and emphasise the awareness and importance of both mother and father as parents, guardians, carers and custodians of their children, and it should <Col N="1526" /> reflect this position in every aspect of parental and child legislation and its practice. This approach will at all times place the welfare of children in the position of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>In the event of marital or relationship breakdown, joint custody and continued shared parenting should be the norm. The State should support the promotion and research into the effects on children and their parents of shared parenting, marriage/relationship breakdown, joint custody, absent parents, and so on, and provide funding for the co-operation of support groups. We must recognise the damaging effect to all parents and their children, in terms of future animosity and mutual mistrust of each other, of the practice of adversarial family law courts. The State must advance the increased involvement of trained personnel with appropriate education and training in psychology and social and negotiating skills and in the process of mediation and consensus building towards agreed solutions in the event of marriage breakdown. The well being and rights of children deserve this.</P>
    <P>In a contribution in November last year to <i>The Irish Times</i>, Ms Mary Banotti, MEP, outlined that, in her work as a European Parliament mediator for transnationally abducted children, she observed some extremely traumatic cases where parents were prepared to go to extreme lengths in the context of the break-up of a relationship. Increasingly in the United States, courts are holding the conduct by one parent which tends to alienate the child's affection from the other as so inimical to the child's welfare as to be grounds for a denial of custody or a change of custody from the parent guilty of such conduct. In some US states, parental alienation syndrome is now a criminal offence for which a parent could be jailed.</P>
    <P>All issues relating to child custody should have the best interests of the child as their base. Children are not responsible for the poor conduct of their parents towards each other and should not be uprooted from their home merely to punish a wayward parent. Attention should be directed to the needs of the child rather than to the actions of the parents as the basis for all child welfare legislation. Nevertheless, a child's best interests are plainly furthered by nurturing his or her relationship with both parents, and a sustained course of conduct by one parent designed to interfere with the child's relationship with the other parent casts serious doubts about the fitness of the offending party to be the custodial parent.</P>
    <P>A growing body of case law in the US has probed the issue of what is now known as parental alienation syndrome. One court declared that the desires of young children subjected to distorted manipulation by a bitter or even well meaning parent do not always reflect their long-term best interests. Although stability is important, the short-term disruption caused by a change of custody may be more than compensated for by the long-term benefits of a healthy relationship with both parents. However, courts should be wary of <Col N="1527" /> an over-reliance on the child's emotional attachment to or expressed preference for the offending parent. Where the evidence discloses a continuous course of conduct by a parent designed to poison a child's relationship with the other parent, a change of custody from the offending parent may well be in the child's best interest in the long-term.</P>
    <P>Another phenomenon in contentious custody cases is persistent alienation by alleging physical or sexual abuse. A US court reversed an award of custody to a mother where the trial court had inexplicably ignored uncontradicted evidence that she had filed numerous false accusations of sexual abuse by the father. As the court observed:</P>
    <P>. . .these repeated uncorroborated and unfounded allegations of sexual abuse, brought by the mother against the father, cast serious doubt about her fitness to be the custodial parent.</P>
    <P>Other courts have made similar observations where mothers had made numerous, bizarre, outrageous and unfounded accusations of child abuse against fathers.</P>
    <P>Letters produced in evidence from children have also given considerable cause for concern. A letter received from a young boy expressing a preference to live with his father was not the product of a child of his age. The court found the boy's recriminations against his mother:</P>
    <P>. . .clearly reflected discussions with his father and further persuaded the court of the father's non-constructive role in corroding the boy's relationship with his mother.</P>
    <P>The court concluded that, while several factors had contributed to the estrangement between mother and son, &ldquo;. . .the single most significant factor had been a constant poisoning of the relationship by the father&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>International child abduction frequently includes dramatic elements of parental alienation syndrome. Extremely painful accusations by one or both parents are almost routine. As a result, what should be a relatively simple law produced under the Hague Convention for returning children to the countries of habitual residence for decisions on their custody becomes a bitter and heartbreaking war of allegations of misconduct. One woman said:</P>
    <P>. . .we started out as two parents who loved their children. Now, because of alienation made by both sides, we are two criminals fighting while our teenage children bear the obvious scars of this process.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to honour its commitment to establish a children's ombudsman. We urgently need such an office to promote children's rights. It is necessary because a significant number of children in Ireland are in situations of considerable disadvantage. They include children in care, children in legal custody, children who <Col N="1528" /> are subject to abuse or neglect, homeless children and children with disabilities. In addition, households with children, especially lone parent families and families with three or more children, are subject to a greater risk of living in poverty.</P>
    <P>Stress affects both young men and women, although males may be proving less adaptable to change. Education which protects against both suicide and attempted suicide must be broadened, especially in the case of boys, to encompass the varying modern social and domestic conditions. The Minister should examine the situation and involve the Department of Health and Children in ensuring proper suicide protection programmes, especially for young men, are put in place. Perhaps the Minister would respond to the sections in the report of the task force on suicide which specifically deal with those under 18 years of age.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Labour Party welcomes the Bill because it is, in effect, a Labour Party Bill. Its heads were agreed over two years ago in the then Department of Equality and Law Reform. It is difficult to understand why it has taken so long to publish the Bill. The Minister's predecessor, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, was very involved in its groundwork and preparation. It is difficult to understand why it has taken such an inordinate length of time for it to come to fruition.</P>
      <P>It is a fact of modern life that parental conflict over custody and access orders for children is becoming increasingly difficult and that children frequently find themselves caught in the middle of the battle. I endorse many of Deputy Neville's comments that children are often the last to be considered in custody battles. With greater mobility and access to travel, the implementation of custody and access orders becomes more difficult when one parent lives in another jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the general thrust of the Bill, though we intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage. In the event, however, of a decision arising out of an order being found to be fundamentally contrary to this jurisdiction's view on the rights of the child, assurances will be required that those rights remain paramount and retain precedence over any such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the convention indicate increasing co-operation between different states in respect of children's issues. This was shown clearly in the deliberations on the child abduction convention. Such close co-operation in the implementation of the law relating to children is a welcome development. I hope many other states sign up to this convention and introduce the necessary legislation to bring its provisions into force in their jurisdictions. It is important to recognise the excellent work carried out by Professor William Duncan at the Hague Conference and to applaud <Col N="1529" /> his contribution to the development of this convention.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the issue of the delay in publishing the Bill, the heads of which were agreed more than two years ago. In my opinion this delay is due largely to the fact that the Government abolished the Department of Equality and Law Reform. When that Department existed in its own right under the then Minister, Mervyn Taylor, a clear focus was given to equality and law reform issues. He drew up an ambitious programme of family law reform which was largely delivered on.</P>
    <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform had an extremely good record in terms of the provision of free legal aid centres. For example, the number of these centres doubled during the term of office of the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, and every county now has a legal aid centre. In addition, a number of centres have been provided in larger urban areas. Great progress was also made in tackling the waiting lists. The Department's greatest contribution came when it delivered the legislation necessary to give effect to the result of the referendum on divorce.</P>
    <P>Combining the Department with the already busy Department of Justice means the area of equality and law reform has been seriously downgraded. I accept the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has a wide agenda in respect of justice which takes up a huge amount of his time and energy. The merger of the two Departments has meant many outstanding equality and law reform issues have been placed on the back burner and have not received the attention they require. The figures bear this out.</P>
    <P>The waiting lists relating to free legal aid centres are disgraceful. Recent figures disclosed in the course of a reply to a parliamentary question are an indictment of the current Minister. For example, people seeking legal aid from the centre at Pope's Quay are obliged to wait 17 months, at South Mall in Cork they must wait almost 23 months, at the Tallaght centre the wait is 14 months, at the Galway centre it is 18 months, at the Newbridge centre it is almost two years and at the centre in Wicklow it is more than 18 months. It is important to realise what such long waiting periods mean to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>The figures are alarming. There is a huge strain on legal aid centres because they do not have the resources to deal effectively with the demands placed on them. I am concerned that cases involving acts of violence could be left on hold for unacceptably long periods and that the victims would be obliged to continue to endure suffering. That the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has allowed the waiting lists to get so out of hand is a further indication of his inability to marry the functions of the former Department of Justice and the former Department of Equality and Law Reform which operated under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> Although the Minister has indicated he is in the process of increasing staff, it is clear his efforts in that regard are completely insufficient. Legal aid should be made available to everyone who needs it, in a speedy and efficient manner. Those people who cannot afford to pay for legal representation should not be treated unjustly by having to wait for unacceptably long periods. As the demand for legal representation increases, our system of legal aid should be vastly expanded. A few extra appointments represent a mere drop in the ocean when compared with people's real needs and the kind of action required from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a contradiction in terms that at a time when our economic surplus has never been greater, people on low incomes are forced to wait for increasingly lengthy periods for basic services such as legal aid. Everyone accepts that justice delayed is justice denied and there are increasing numbers of people who are not in a position to pay expensive legal bills. For those who must rely on legal aid, the inaction of the Minister has meant they are being denied the justice to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the lack of priority the Government has given to issues that relate to children. The previous speaker referred to how it downgraded the post of Minister of State with responsibility for children. The Government did not seem to understand the need for the Minister of State who occupied that post having a remit within the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science &ndash; the three Departments most concerned with children's issues &ndash; so that he or she could co-ordinate their efforts and provide for co-operation and a sharing of information between them.</P>
    <P>It was not until the Government became answerable to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that consideration was given to this matter. A quick U-turn was performed on the eve of its appearance before that committee when the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, through embarrassment at the performance of the Government, hastily reported that the Minister of State with responsibility would be given a remit in each of the three Departments.</P>
    <P>Appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for an area as important and as wide-ranging as this is simply missing the point in respect of the importance of children and the pressing issues that relate to them which must be dealt with as a matter of urgency. I have no doubt the only way children's issues will be properly addressed and services relating to children will be properly resourced is by appointing a senior Minister with the clout to ensure adequate resources are made available, proper prevention systems are put in place and our fire brigade systems operate adequately to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of reaction to the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; television programme and indignation about the appalling abuse which took <Col N="1531" /> place in the past. Unless the Government and its successors have the political will to provide the kind of resources that are needed to protect children and to give them an adequate and safe opportunity to realise their potential, I have no doubt that in ten years' time someone will make a television programme about the neglect which took place in 1999.</P>
    <P>An independent review on the social services in the Eastern Health Board area was carried out recently. The report, which was damning, found that the services are operating at crisis level and that only the fire brigade cases are being dealt with. There is virtually no prevention work being done and there is great dissatisfaction and stress among social workers in the Eastern Health Board area because they are in the unenviable position of having to prioritise cases of child abuse and deal with them urgently. Many hundreds of cases are put on waiting lists to receive attention. That causes great stress among social workers because there is the uncertainty they may leave children in dangerous circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many social workers know children are left in dangerous circumstances at home or with relations or neighbours because the resources do not exist to provide the necessary services to protect them. Unless the political will is found to provide the type of resources required, I have no doubt we will look back in ten years' time and see we had no excuse for neglecting children. We will realise that money was available but the political will to ensure proper services were put in place was lacking.</P>
    <P>The Government has been seriously remiss in producing modern juvenile justice legislation. We are still operating on the basis of the Children Act, 1908, which underpins the reform and industrial schools of which we have heard so much recently. Many of those institutions have been closed, but that does not mean children are out of danger. We need modern legislation to deal with juvenile crime, children who come in contact with the law and children who are taken into custodial care because the legislation in this area is archaic.</P>
    <P>The most pressing issue in my Dublin constituency is juvenile crime, some of which is not too serious and some of which involves children staying out at night, drinking in open spaces and misusing drugs. Their parents do not seem to be interested in what they are doing. This is a common problem and a cause for complaint by other people. Large numbers of children are involved in serious anti-social activities and lawlessness. I am talking about the prevalence of joyriding, the ownership and lack of control of horses, motorbike riding, teenagers intimidating older citizens and children and teenagers involved in theft, causing trouble in their local community and being a nuisance and a threat to people who are trying to live their lives peacefully.</P>
    <P>This area is unregulated at present. The gardaí are not sure how to react to this growing problem <Col N="1532" /> because the political will is not there. Ancient legislation covers this area and the Government seems completely disinterested in updating it. In 1996 the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, introduced the Children Bill. That was introduced after widespread consultation with a number of different agencies and it passed Second Stage in the House. Since then it has languished awaiting consideration on Committee Stage. The Government has failed to produce amendments to it and it seems to be at sixes and sevens on what should be done. It does not know if it will introduce a new Bill or if it will table amendments to the existing one.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Taoiseach about this Bill on a regular basis but he seems to be confused. Priority is not being given to producing this legislation. We are getting waffle from the Minister and from the Taoiseach about what will happen to the Bill. I ask the Minister to make a clear and unequivocal statement about juvenile justice legislation. Will we get a new Bill or will the existing Bill be amended? Perhaps he could let us know when we can expect action on this important area.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been seriously remiss in relation to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Ireland signed that convention in 1991 and the following year we ratified it without reservation. However, since then there has been no action by the Government to incorporate it in legislation. More than two years ago the Constitution review group examined the issue and produced a draft constitutional amendment to provide for the rights of children. The all-party committee on the Constitution seems to be working at a slow pace and in chronological order so it will be some time before Article 41 on the family is reached and recommendations made. I strongly urge the Government to deal with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as a separate issue and to show it is committed to incorporating it in legislation.</P>
    <P>There was a great flurry of activity after the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme was shown on television. While it might have been well meant &ndash; I welcomed the apology to the victims on behalf of the State &ndash; much of it was ill-thought out and did not have regard to the fact that children are still abused and neglected. The best way the Government can show it is serious about children's rights is by providing for a constitutional amendment to incorporate the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in our Constitution. I urge the Government to do that as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Among the issues mentioned by Deputy Neville which show the Government is not serious about tackling the issue of children is the rowing back of the commitment to establish an ombudsman for children. Many problems would not exist or continue to exist if an independent statutory office was established with the role of fighting for children, carrying out inspections, asking questions of Government, taking up com<Col N="1533" /> plaints from children and parents and ensuring children's rights are protected. If that were set up, we would get our act together and put in place the type of services required. I urge the Government to give this matter priority.</P>
    <P>Many important issues arise as a result of the prevalence of family breakdown which we all witness in our constituencies. Our treatment of non-marital couples and the fact there is no incentive or encouragement given to lone parents to play an active role in the parenting of their children are fundamental issues which need to be addressed at a political level.</P>
    <P>Our tax, welfare and housing systems actively discourage single fathers from playing a role in their children's lives. This was evident a couple of years ago when the Committee on the Family commissioned Colm Rapple to do research on this issue. I requested it because I come across it on a regular basis in my constituency. Couples who are thinking about getting married or living together sometimes ask me how their tax and social welfare entitlements will be affected. My response, which was borne out by Colm Rapple's research, is that couples stand to lose between 30 to 40 per cent of their income if they live together or get married. It is a serious indictment of our systems that we penalise parents who want to live together as a family unit in marriage or by co-habiting. That is an extremely dangerous and wrong message to send to people. We should encourage both parents to play an active role in the rearing of their children. The point has been reached where people simply cannot afford to do that and there are many unofficial and irregular arrangements to get around our very restrictive social welfare and tax systems. When parents live apart, both can get double tax free allowances, whereas if they live together they can get only one. The financial incentive is for parents to live apart and that must be ended quickly. It is one of the most significant factors in our high number of lone parents.</P>
    <P>A public debate is needed on parenting and the responsibilities attaching to it. An increasingly prevalent feature of society is that children, sometimes as young as seven and eight, are out on the streets until 11 p.m or midnight. One wonders whether those children have parents, what their parents are doing and if they care about their children. The role and responsibility of parents need to be covered in juvenile justice legislation so that it is made clear that the State expects them to play a full and responsible role in the rearing of their children and that it is not suggesting they can have as many children as they like and not be called to account. Currently, too many parents opt out of their responsibilities and children are completely unattached. Many have no attachment to home and are allowed to run wild. Increasingly, they lose interest in school and drop out, and it is only a matter of time before they end up in trouble with the law. The emphasis needs to be returned to the role of parents in rearing their children; the State cannot do it. The <Col N="1534" /> State can and should encourage and support parents in a much stronger way but, clearly, responsibility for looking after their children must rest with the parents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill, which is long overdue. We will table amendments on Committee Stage. However, I urge the Government to pay serious attention to law reform because it has been neglected over the past two years. In particular, I ask it to take much more seriously issues that relate to children. Let us have action because there has been enough debate. Let us put in place the resources needed for proper child welfare and protection services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. The protection of children's rights is one of the most important social objectives any Government could have. Children are our future but they are also vulnerable to falling victim to malicious forces in society. The abduction of a child from his or her home country and removal to another country, normally in an underhand and malevolent manner, is an appalling state of affairs that cannot be allowed to go unpunished.</P>
      <P>A legal framework must be put in place which affords an easy option to an aggrieved parent to be able to allow a court hearing to take place which would resolve wrangles over where a child should reside. This is where the convention comes into play. It has secured the support of all EU member states, Canada and the US. Basically, under the convention if an alleged abduction takes place a court action can be taken by an aggrieved party which will ensure an abducted child must return to the country from which he or she left.</P>
      <P>For example, if an Irish parent left Shannon Airport for America with a child without the permission or knowledge of the other parent, that parent could file a case in America invoking the provisions of the Hague Convention. This means a judge in America would be obliged to send the child back to Ireland and have a court hearing here if a dispute arose as to where the child should live. It is only right and proper that such a court hearing should take place in Ireland because it would be in the best interests of the child that it be heard in his or her host country.</P>
      <P>If a child is abducted &ndash;  the word &ldquo;abduction&rdquo; is given a very broad definition &ndash; it is clear that terrible psychological damage can be done to him or her which can have far-reaching consequences. Chapter II deals with this matter. It espouses the principle that, in general, jurisdiction in proceedings that relate to the protection of the person or property of a child &ndash; custody access, etc. &ndash; is best exercised by the contracting state where the child is habitually resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures taken in one contracting state for the protection of a child or its property must be enforced and recognised in all contracting states under the convention. Recognition may be refused, for example, on the basis that it would be manifestly contrary to public policy or that the <Col N="1535" /> measure was taken by an authority which jurisdiction was not based on one of the grounds of jurisdiction provided for in the convention.</P>
    <P>Contracting states to the convention are required to designate a central authority to co-operate with other central authorities. A central authority's functions include facilitating agreed solutions for the protection of a child's person or property in cases to which the convention applies and at the request of another competent authority providing assistance in discovering the whereabouts of a child who may be present in its territory and in need of protection.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, as in the case of the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991 and the Maintenance Act, 1994, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will appoint a neutral authority for the State. I am aware of the child abduction centre which operates within his Department. It plays a helpful role in advising parents on how they can invoke the provisions of the Hague Convention if a particular problem arises. It also ensures a counterpart central authority, whether in America or elsewhere, is notified that an alleged abduction has taken place. This ensures the appropriate agencies in a third country are aware of the background to a particular case and can play an important role when legal action is initiated under the convention. The convention provides that the rules of jurisdiction will apply in a state only after it has entered into force there and the provisions, recognition and enforcement contained in it will apply to measures after the enactment of the convention both in the state of origin of the measures and in the requested state.</P>
    <P> Who are the relevant authorities that will be capable of invoking the provisions of the convention? The terms &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; are used throughout the convention. In some contexts, they mean courts in the state, whereas in others they mean administrative agencies concerned with the protection of children. The District Court is also empowered to exercise jurisdiction in regard to the recognition and enforcement of a measure taken in another contracting state.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV contains the rules under which measures in regard to children will be recognised and enforced between contracting states. This provides for requests from authorities in other contracting states to Irish courts to take measures to protect a child who habitually resides in this jurisdiction; provide information where necessary; and assist in the implementation of measures already taken by those authorities, especially in regard to access to the child. In urgent cases jurisdiction may be exercised by any judge of the Circuit or District Court if he or she is of the opinion that the best interests of the child requires it. Section 5 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the relevant judgments of courts of other contracting States concerning the provision of the convention and obliges courts in <Col N="1536" /> the State to take account of the principles laid down by those judgments.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires the registrar or clerk of a court in this State to give certain documents to a person who wishes to make an application under the convention in another contracting State. The documents which are specified in this section are by reference to the requirements of the convention or are matters which a foreign court would require to be informed of for the purposes of recognition or enforcement of a measure in another contracting State. Section 7 deals with the admissibility in evidence in court proceedings of documents forwarded or delivered under the convention. It provides for the admissibility or translation of such document, provided it is certified as correct by a person competent to do so.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that under sections 8 and 9 the central authorities must co-operate fully with each other in abduction cases. This is very important if there are to be expeditious hearings of cases at any particular time. For example, if a child has been abducted from Ireland and brought to America it is only right that there is maximum co-operation between the Central Authority for International Child Abduction in Ireland and its counterpart in America.</P>
    <P>The bottom line with the Hague Convention is that the welfare of the child is paramount at all times and that justice must be administered in a speedy manner so that the trauma of the incident is overcome. While the staffing and financial implications are difficult to assess until such time as the convention comes into force, it is not expected the implications will be significant. The convention will entail an increased and more formalised co-operation between the courts and agencies in contracting states dealing with child protection. Article 38 of the convention provides that without prejudice to the possibility of imposing charges for the provision of services, central authorities and other public authorities shall bear their own costs in the key provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>I know the Government will continue to help the Central Authority for International Child Abduction in Ireland to exercise its duties in a professional and caring manner. Proper funding must also be made available to guarantee effective service in child abduction cases. The children in our society are our future. We must at all times ensure maximum assistance is given to children from all walks of life so that they can fully integrate into working society as they get older. Primary school education is very important in this regard and particular emphasis must also be given to increasing the number of remedial teachers in schools in urban and rural Ireland. Assistance must also be given to early school leavers The full legal recognition of the Hague Convention is simply another example of how Ireland is doing all it can to help the children of the nation. I support the Government on this and related matters as it seeks to give children real protection against harm and injustice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Like Deputies Neville, Shortall and Collins, I welcome the ratification of the Hague Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children. Like Deputies Neville and Shortall, I am at a loss to know why we have had a four year delay in ratifying this convention. We stand indicted for the way in which we sign up to all sorts of international conventions and protocols willy-nilly, yet we are extremely tardy when it comes to giving them practical legislative effect so that they have the full force of law. We have commented on this time and again and I am not blaming any particular Government. However, if we sign up to a convention we should be part and parcel of that convention and enter into the spirit of it so that it is given practical legislative effect at the first available opportunity. We have been found wanting in this regard in relation to this convention.</P>
      <P>The protection of children must be put at the top of the agenda as this is an extremely difficult world for children to grow up in. It is difficult enough for children from what might be termed normal or stable backgrounds, but it is particularly difficult for children from deprived or dysfunctional backgrounds. We are encouraged by pundits and politicians to bask in the remorseless triumph and surge of the tiger economy but life is becoming much worse for a growing number of vulnerable children.</P>
      <P>The system of child care is in crisis. It is unplanned, inadequate, under-resourced and overwhelmed. The majority of the growing number of damaged children are not getting the urgent services they need and which they would get in almost any other western society. As has been said before, the current situation is a shambles. Dozens of children roam our city streets every night carrying a blanket and a small bundle of possessions while they look for a sheltered doorway in which to spend the night or beg city garda stations to take them in. This is because society, for all its excess and pretentiousness, has failed them.</P>
      <P>We have no appropriate child residential facilities. Children who commit crimes are sent to adult detention centres because there are insufficient places for young offenders. Children who have committed no offence can be held in St. Patrick's Institution because they can be held nowhere else. Each year the Eastern Health Board spends many thousands of pounds defending court cases as it cannot provide the care deemed necessary for young people at risk. Adult psychiatric hospitals are regularly asked to provide accommodation for young people and adolescents with mental problems and psychiatric illnesses as there is virtually no residential accommodation available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not blame the health boards, as they can only work with the resources assigned to them. On an almost daily basis they face new duties and responsibilities heaped on those with which they <Col N="1538" /> are already trying to cope. The Minister for Finance proudly proclaimed his lifelong devotion to the Gaelic Athletic Association by allocating a grossly excessive sum of £20 million of taxpayers' money to a commercially successful Croke Park. However, some weeks afterwards his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, faced the wrath of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. The Minister of State is a compassionate person, as we have seen in her insistence that refugees and asylum seekers should be permitted to work in Ireland pending the determination of their applications for asylum. We also saw that in her determination to ensure we do not confine ourselves to accepting a mere 1,000 Kosovan refugees, in her visit to refugee camps in Macedonia and in her visit to the Coombe Hospital where she was photographed with the young Kosovan mother who had just given birth.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister of State will no doubt long remember how she was left squirming with embarrassment as she felt the full wrath of the UN committee's assessment of Ireland's less than acceptable performance in the child care area. She was asked by the committee whether Ireland &ldquo;has adopted or is planning to adopt a comprehensive national strategy for children.&rdquo;  Her reply on behalf of Ireland was a revelation. She stated:</P>
    <P>To date, our concentration has been on individual issues. Eventually it would be our intention to draw a wide range of individual developments together in the context of a national strategy.</P>
    <P>Members should note the word &ldquo;eventually&rdquo;, as there is a complete absence of any sense of urgency. Here we are on the world stage, before a UN committee, having our performance and track record on the provision of services for vulnerable children scrutinised. It was merely the eventual intention of one of the top economic performers of Europe and the world to put together a national child care strategy. Many of our children will become drug, alcohol and suicide statistics, even before they grow up.</P>
    <P>Our performance in relation to childcare has been abysmal and continues to be so. It took 22 years to bring the Child Care Act from its inception to full implementation. When the Act finally passed the Oireachtas it was enacted only piecemeal and by instalment. Planning for the new juvenile justice Bill to replace the Children Act of 1908 began 25 years ago and the Bill has not yet been published.</P>
    <P>Our mental health legislation, which covers the provision of mental health services for children as well as adults, is more than 50 years old. It is outdated and has been rightly condemned but we still await a modern law to replace it. The Children Bill was published in 1996 and has still not passed Committee Stage. We have no strategic plan for child care. We still await the long promised social services inspectorate. It surfaces regularly in the midst or in the wake of some high <Col N="1539" /> profile controversy or crisis but recedes when things blow over, only to re-emerge when the Minister is summoned to Geneva to account for Ireland's performance at a UN committee.</P>
    <P>More children remain in care, and for longer, in Ireland than in any other country because our support services are inadequate. The State intervenes and takes difficult, demoralised and disturbed children from parents who cannot cope yet the State is unable to say how many children are in State care. The latest figures available are for 1992. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, told the UN in Geneva 18 months ago that we may get an up to date figure eventually.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the health boards and particularly with the Eastern Health Board which must deal with the highest concentration of problems. The Eastern Health Board copes with inadequate resources and without a coherent national strategy and bears the brunt of political and public criticism when controversy arises. The board continues to struggle, employing a strategy of crisis management with an overriding emphasis on containment, detention and security. We have failed our children. Our capital city is littered with children begging, sleeping rough and consuming drugs and drink. Our newspapers daily contain court reports of physical and sexual abuse of children. We must tackle the blight of homeless children and the physical, psychological and emotional deprivation which accompanies that blight and which scars our society.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to protect the physical, emotional and property rights of children. Rights and welfare are inextricably bound together. Many children who find themselves in crisis deserve tremendous credit for surviving their parents. Many parents do not understand that parenting involves more than the provision of food and clothing. It involves caring, listening, talking and emotionally supporting. It also involves setting standards to be emulated. If parents set an example of social and domestic disruption, violence, drunkenness and crime, there is little hope for their children. If parents place no emphasis on discipline and self-control and give no support to schooling, what hope is there for their children? I agree, to some extent, with those who say that blaming the parents of juvenile delinquents solves nothing. Many such parents were brought up in equally dysfunctional families and in the same disruptive environment in which they are bringing up their own children. However, if children cannot be controlled in their homes, the State must be empowered to intervene. The school is a very potent social instrument.</P>
    <P>We fail our children in numerous ways, not least by providing inadequate facilities. If children have no outlet for their energy, who can blame them if they fall foul of the law? There is a great onus on society to invest in the provision of off-street recreational and sporting facilities <Col N="1540" /> for children whose energies and talents will otherwise be channelled into mischief and crime.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shortall that the integration of the Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform was a retrograde step. Justice is a challenging and demanding portfolio and is more than sufficient responsibility for one Minister. In the eyes of the public, the Justice portfolio carries more weight than that of Equality and Law Reform. The former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, brought equality and law reform out of the shadows and won a new respect for these areas of Government. It is regrettable that equality and law reform have receded into the shadows again. The two Departments should be separated once again so that the rights of children are given the priority they deserve. Otherwise, we will continue to lurch from crisis to crisis with no coherent strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins on his contribution. I understand that it is the prerogative of Opposition Members to criticise the Government but one must admit that the Government is committed to the protection of children's rights. This Bill is indicative of that commitment. It takes a step towards honouring our international obligations by implementing the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children, the purpose of which is to prevent the horrible phenomenon of child abduction across international frontiers. Life has become complicated. Parents are under enormous pressure with their finances stretched to breaking point. Sometimes a parent will abduct a child and bring him or her across a frontier. This convention is being implemented to ensure greater co-ordination in dealing with this phenomenon. Every Deputy has encountered at least one case.</P>
      <P>I know of a woman living in Australia whose relatives are constituents of mine. They are being intimidated by criminal elements connected with her estranged husband. She has been visited by his family. The situation is difficult. Her relatives have asked me to obtain documentation from the courts or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the individual concerned has a criminal record and comes from a notorious criminal background. She will have to fight a custody battle in the Australian courts which will remain ignorant of this essential fact. This highlights the lack of international co-operation in the area. The matter needs to be addressed urgently. Often the persons involved are torn apart and vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the enforcement of judgments. There is a need to modernise the courts system. There are many recent examples where basic information was not available. This is also a feature of the British system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the position of children in society, Deputy Higgins painted a dismal picture. It is not as bad as he makes out. World Health Organisation figures show a definite decline in infant mortality. <Col N="1541" /> While one could not base one's policies on children and the family on such statistics alone, they are a good benchmark of prosperity and advancement, although much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I contributed last week to the debate on industrial schools. It has to be recognised that enormous mistakes were made in the past. Children in the custody of religious orders &ndash; I use the word advisedly &ndash; were abused and are psychologically and emotionally scarred as a result. We have read about their experiences in the media. I met an individual recently who has an extreme view about the Church and its role in society. He believes its property should be taken from it and that it should be removed from the education system. All classes and sections of society, which did not have the elaborate social welfare support system now in place, colluded in the abuse and in sweeping the problem under the carpet. The Government and the Opposition have expressed their regret and offered a proper apology. We must now focus on the future and ensure the rights of young people are protected.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s and 1980s there was an ongoing debate about corporal punishment, to which I was subject in secondary school between 1975 and 1980, which was inflicted with varying degrees of severity and which is now accepted as being deplorable and wrong. I cannot say I suffered psychologically as a result, although a great many others did, not because they were weak but because they were unable to deal with that kind of physical abuse psychologically.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised, if necessary in our constitutional framework, that children come first and must be protected. It is important, however, that the legal structure put in place to defend them is not over elaborate. There is a need to adopt a wider focus and to concentrate on parents. Because of economic disadvantage parents in the suburban ghettos which have been created simply cannot cope. There is a need to involve them to a far greater degree in the education system. Teachers often complain that the problems of society are being dumped on them but the local school, which is at the centre of most communities, is the ideal place in which to develop child-focused policies and to deal with the psychological and other difficulties that arise in the family setting, principally because of economic disadvantage and poverty.</P>
    <P>I recall reading the famous <i>Angela's Ashes </i>by Frank McCourt on a recent summer holiday. It is a remarkable book in many respects. I do not know how accurate it is &ndash; I am aware that people from Limerick react sourly to it &ndash; but I suspect the lifestyle painted was not confined to Mr. McCourt, that it was reflected in society at large. It is the first book to deal with the matter in detail and is a good emotional account of what life was like at the time. <i>Angela's Ashes </i>is a great book which tells us a little about where we went wrong as a society. It also teaches us much about keeping our sense of perspective in that somebody can <Col N="1542" /> come through that, although it is not right they should have to do so in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have a few minutes to talk about an issue which I regard as one of the most significant to face local government. In the context of local government elections, the issue of waste management is one which I believe will pose the greatest challenge to local and national Government. It is worth noting that the legislative measures mentioned in the Fine Gael motion, the Litter Pollution Act, the Waste Management Act and the Packaging Waste Regulations, were all brought in by me as Minister for the Environment. I believed it was imperative to have a comprehensive and complementary package of legislative measures to deal with waste and the perennial problem of litter. For anybody coming back to the new developing Ireland to witness the prosperity, the new sense of confidence and the new spirit of Ireland, the one negative on which everybody, unfortunately, comments is desecration of the land of Ireland with litter.</P>
      <P>No Minister coming into office had such a comprehensive amount and good framework of legislation in place and ready to be developed. I am heartily disappointed that, by and large, little or no progress has been made in implementing the ideals enshrined in both Acts. As regards the Litter Pollution Act, it was envisaged that there would be a draconian system of enforcement to ensure that if we could not win the argument against litter by persuasion, we would do so with legislative tactics. That strategy worked in countries like Singapore in the past and, unfortunately, it might be necessary here. It seems as if the initiative of having a requirement on local authorities to have a strategy for litter abatement and the establishment of a litter pollution unit in the Department of Environment and Local Government to drive national policy and to ensure a comprehensive range of litter wardens seems to have fizzled out. There is certainly no discernible reduction in the volume of litter on our streets and in our workplaces. It has failed because of the absence of will from the present Minister and Administration. Because the concept was not their own, they decided it was one which need not be put to the fore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waste Management Act was the most comprehensive environmental legislation brought through these Houses since the enactment of the Environmental Protection Act earlier this decade. It was, if you like, the final block in that corpus of legislation which deal with water, air and solid waste pollution. It came from the topic I posed at an informal Council meeting of Environment Ministers which I insisted on having dur<Col N="1544" /> ing the Irish Presidency. The Waste Management Act has informed European directives in that regard and established in Irish law the concept of the waste pyramid, waste minimisation and reduction, recycling and waste disposal. Precious little has happened since then, and local authorities now face crises.</P>
    <P>Old fashioned dumps are full and there is total resistance to establishing new landfill. There is no discernible driven policy to ensure an alternative is in place. Many of the landfills are simply not accepting new waste. Whole categories of waste are being refused in many of the landfills up and down this country. There is no sense of a comprehensive strategy being in place to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to the motion was feeble. He said policy development and clear policy direction on waste management is in place and that there will be a further statement this year. We have enough policy statements, and we have legislation. What we want is action. What will the Minister do to help local authorities deal with the waste crisis and to ensure the level of recycling we promised is implemented because precious little recycling is going on? We have not improved a whit in the past two years on achieving the recycling targets we set ourselves. The Minister congratulated himself on the initiative between Repak and the Irish Farm Film Producers Group. The negotiations on plastic recyclables took place two years ago.</P>
    <P>Groups such Irish Business Against Litter have been proactive in this regard and groups such as Repak have sought legislative and administrative support to ensure the good example shown by compliant producers of waste is met by those who are recalcitrant. They are all disappointed by the response of this Minister and Government. I hope the issue of solid waste management and the related co-issue of litter abatement will be made a priority in this Administration. I hope the Minister of State with clear responsibility for this issue will be spurred on by this debate to take a proactive, imaginative and, if necessary, a draconian stand to make Ireland litter free and to make Ireland's waste management policy the envy of Europe and the world. We can do it if there is a will but, unfortunately, there is not a shred of evidence of such a will.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on what the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, have been doing in relation to waste management. Whatever about the achievements of previous Ministers, this Minister was the first to state clearly that we should move away from landfill as regards waste management. The Minister launched a document on 1 October 1998 in which he stated the days of landfill, which currently cater for almost 92 per cent of municipal waste, <Col N="1545" /> are numbered and that both from a national and EU perspective, landfill must become a subsidiary element of an integrated waste infrastructure catering only for residual waste which cannot be prevented or otherwise treated. The Minister stated very clearly in that blueprint for waste management the hierarchy of policies favoured by him and the Government. He favours prevention and then minimisation and recycling. The disposal of waste is the least favoured option. I hope we will support the Minister in the work he is doing to tackle this serious issue.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a very important role to play in terms of our national waste management performance, and they must discharge that role. I was disappointed at the attitude of Galway County Council, for example. The first decision it should have made, and which I believe it will now make, relates to a site for a thermal treatment plant or incinerator. I fail to see why this is not the way this matter is dealt with, whether on a county or regional basis. We should consider where an incinerator will be provided. Because this was not done in the case of Galway County Council and, I am sure, other local authorities, communities are concerned that not only will they get a super dump but also an incinerator or thermal treatment plant.</P>
      <P>I hope the fear of people in the three communities in Galway which were named for possible landfill sites &ndash; a super dump cannot be located in Connemara or west Galway &ndash; has been allayed by the correspondence we received from the assistant county manager of Galway County Council which stated that a thermal treatment plant or incinerator must provide an energy recovery facility. In the circumstances Mr. Nelson, the assistant county manager, said the thermal treatment plant would have to be cited close to the national electricity grid, a large centre of population or a major industrial complex and as close as possible to the single largest urban area to minimise transportation costs of refuse to the plant. He also stated the plant would have to be located close to the national road and rail networks to avoid incurring major expenditure on road upgrading. For this reason the consulting engineers, M.C. O'Sullivan, have recommended that the plant be located on the eastern fringe of Galway city. The statement that the thermal treatment plant must be located near the city is very important, and there are many sites which could be provided in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem in Galway is that a large number of sites were mentioned in terms of landfill locations. The number of sites was eventually reduced to three, namely, at Newbridge, New Inn and Kilrickle, and many reasons were given for and against these locations. Poor roads were mentioned in the case of Newbridge, the site at Kilrickle was near a school and in New Inn, which had a dump up to seven years ago, the site was near industrial and archaeological sites. There is a case to be made for having regional or county dumps <Col N="1546" /> located as far as possible from populated areas and I understand this has been the goal of Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>A landfill only two kilometres from Ballinasloe was used not only by the local town and County Galway but also by the adjoining counties Offaly and Roscommon. A major concern of the people is that the location in question could become a regional site. We understand that in the long-term the site at Ballinasloe is not on any list, but I am not too happy at the manner in which things have been handled. We rushed too quickly to close smaller dumps before having a plan in place. We were immediately faced with a situation where the dump near Ballinasloe had to cater for a large amount of refuse.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Howlin said, I think we have made progress on recycling. The spring 1999 edition of Rehab's recycling newsletter states that recycling levels in Ireland have reached a new peak. The Rehab Recycling Partnership recycled an impressive 16,000 tonnes of glass in 1998, a record amount representing 48.3 million bottles and jars. Of course there is room for improvement, Ireland coming 11th in the EU table in terms of glass recycling. While our recycling rate of 38 per cent is ahead of the 23 per cent rate in the UK we are a long way behind the top performers in Europe such as Austria which has a glass recycling rate of 88 per cent, the Netherlands which has a rate of 82 per cent, Germany which has a rate of 79 per cent, Norway and Sweden which have a rate of 76 per cent and Belgium which has a rate of 75 per cent. Obviously recycling is a very important issue in terms of waste management.</P>
    <P>I also note that Galway County Council and Galway Corporation have emphasised the role of job creation in recycling, which is welcome. The Rehab Recycling Partnership employs 51 people directly, while another 15 people are employed on a sub-contract basis in the collection and transportation of material. The German Government says it always provides jobs when an EU directive is issued. I hope we will be able to do this in future and show that job creation will result from our waste management policy.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council and Galway Corporation have announced new restrictions on the amount of glass it will accept in landfill sites. This is one of the reasons 96 pubs in Galway city have joined a new glass collection scheme. The private sector has a major role to play in waste management and job creation in this context. The public houses involved in this initiative have made a major contribution. I understand each pub has three bins, one each for clear glass, green glass and brown glass. The scheme is very detailed and I believe it will provide a very good service. It comes at a time when the Carrowbrowne landfill site near Galway city has closed, the site in Ballinasloe deals with waste from County Galway and adjoining counties and Galway has to decide where the long-term landfill site will be located. I am glad of the private sector initiatives such as <Col N="1547" /> the Rehab recycling initiative and the initiative of the public houses in Galway.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on what they are doing. I know that every town and village is looking for a bottle bank, but it should be pointed out that there is a cost involved. Correspondence from my local authority states that if the community has funds to pay the annual maintenance charge of approximately £500 they can deal directly with Rehab. It is an excellent idea for communities which can raise such money to have a bottle bank and perhaps other such facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of other Members at the rate of progress in dealing with waste management and litter. Deputy Howlin was clapping himself on the back for bringing forward much of the legislation and in fairness he played his part. However, we should deal with the issue collectively, and I do not intend to point score as we approach local and European elections.</P>
      <P>The most common form of pollution is litter. I compliment Deputy Wallace on some of the initiatives he has taken to deal with the problem, but we cannot be too happy with the rate of progress. We must realise that much work remains to be done. Littering is an anti-social behaviour and one which has a certain acceptance in some areas. It would take very little to change this behaviour if the right approach was adopted. We must encourage communities and businesses to respond to the problem. We often talk about being ashamed of our streets and about the perception of visitors. However, I am keener to have the streets clean for the benefit of those living there and enduring the problem 365 days a year.</P>
      <P>Under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, local authorities were given the necessary powers to tackle the litter problem. Some local authorities have been very proactive and have used a certain amount of imagination in this context. Local authorities have a certain flexibility in dealing with the problem in terms of expenditure and the recruitment of litter wardens. Last night the Minister said here that in the second half of 1998 205 litter wardens had issued 4,300 on-the-spot fines. I take it that was a big increase on the previous year but one only needs to be stopped at traffic lights for a short while to see someone throw a cigarette butt, a paper, the butt of an apple or something else on the street. We have been far too lenient about this sort of behaviour and it is time it was nipped in the bud. Last year and earlier this year there were a couple of cases where people were taken to court and fined for throwing cigarette butts on the street. Those cases generated a great deal of publicity. It came as a great surprise to many people that this was the new law in Ireland. It is a pity there are not a few more cases like that because it is the best publicity one could give the anti-litter campaign. We have been too slow in tackling littering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> Many local authorities employ a sweeper to sweep the streets each morning or a couple of mornings a week. While it is fine to have someone clean up the mess in the morning, the fact that the sweeper must clean up the mess each day means that our method of tackling the problem is simply not working. We must reach a stage where there will no longer be a need for these people to clean up every day.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are required to adopt a litter management plan and most, if not all, have done so; some of them have been slow to produce their plan. The only message we can take from that is that, for many local authorities, dealing with litter is not a major priority. While that is regrettable, it is something of which the Minister should take note and on which he should take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister mentioned the monitoring body which he has set in place. It must be continually emphasised that it is necessary to scrutinise the new responses which local authorities have drawn up to deal with the litter problem and to ensure that good practices or new imaginative practices which are working are highlighted and that other local authorities are made aware of them. If they can work in one local authority, there is no reason they will not work somewhere else.</P>
    <P>The national spring clean was a wonderful idea. Last night the Minister said that over 150,000 participated in anti-litter initiatives throughout the country. Many schools got involved and some of them dealt with the problem imaginatively. They showed great commitment. While public awareness, in itself, is important, public commitment to tackle the litter problem is vital. While the national spring clean is a worthwhile initiative, it is short lived. We want an ongoing commitment from the public to tackle this problem. We must encourage people to break their bad habits. Deputy Howlin stated that draconian action must be taken and I would support that.</P>
    <P>Take-aways are to blame to a large extent for litter in towns. All sorts of cartons and drinks' containers may be seen on the street, often beside litter bins, which people just do not bother to use. We must place a greater onus on the owners of these outlets, before they lock their doors at night, to clean up the mess in front of their premises. They are providing a service and it is obviously a good business, but it cannot all be one way traffic and they must play their part. Since it is their customers who are responsible for this litter, it is important that they do not neglect their duties in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have often noticed at the races that punters who back a loser are never happy to put their docket in a bin; they have to tear it up. I am sure Deputy Carey, like me, has been guilty of this too. Maybe we could ask Senator Lydon or one of his colleagues to conduct a study to see whether <Col N="1549" /> a person derives satisfaction from tearing up the docket after his or her horse loses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps a student will conduct a comprehensive study on it and let us know why it happens.</P>
      <P>We must have a more imaginative approach to dealing with the litter problem. There have been several publicity campaigns where we asked people to get involved, but I want to see the private sector become involved. If McDonalds, for instance, was given charge of a stretch of road, such as the Naas dual carriageway from Newlands Cross to Kill or even the main street in Naas, and once a week the McDonalds people went out in their colourful uniforms to pick up the litter, it would give the private sector the opportunity to be seen to be giving back something to the community and it would be good advertising also. It is something which could be explored. Perhaps it could start off on a pilot basis. We could give them responsibility for cleaning up a main street or a side street and the residents of that area would know who was responsible for it. If there was that sort of co-operation, it could be beneficial to all.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues, Deputies Kitt and Power, for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>The management and control of waste of one type or another and its disposal in an environmentally friendly fashion has become a difficult subject over the past number of years. Difficulties have arisen over proposed landfill sites and dumps throughout the country. It is a thorny issue. The Department of the Environment and Local Government in conjunction with the local authorities must find new ways to dispose of waste and to cut down the volume of waste being generated by consumers and consumer friendly products.</P>
      <P>When I was going to national school more than 20 years ago, there was a ferocious campaign to encourage people to use litter bins in public places and to ensure that litter was not strewn around Ireland. While there has been much publicity to combat litter on village streets and in the hedgerows, it is still a huge ongoing problem even though the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities are implementing regulations. The problem persists because it is easier to dump a bag of rubbish at the side of the road than to ensure that it goes into a landfill or to pay the management fee. A vast amount of work on litter awareness is being done through the education system. Adults have a responsibility to provide good example to ensure people do not continue to litter the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork County Council is running a competition this year to find the most litter free village in the county. Last Monday evening as I walked through <Col N="1550" /> my own village of Kiskeam after a funeral, the discussion turned to the number of cigarette butts strewn throughout the village. County council inspectors view every piece of litter, and local people, together with FÁS workers, go through the village picking up cigarette butts and other rubbish. Even though the village is quite small, the people I spoke to said it was possible to go through the village four or five times a day and still find litter strewn around.</P>
    <P>With the evolution of silage making, farm plastics have become a major issue in rural Ireland. In the course of excavation work, huge build-ups of farm plastics are discovered. Sometimes the plastics are burnt on massive bonfires and other times they are buried. However, they remain in the system as they are not properly disposed of. Directives are now in place in this regard and farm relief services are putting systems in place whereby farm plastics are collected. It is difficult to encourage farmers to adopt litter or waste disposal programmes.</P>
    <P>There are many unauthorised dumps in rural Ireland in which all sorts of rubbish, including dead animals, are dumped. That is a disgrace and I urge county councils to enforce the laws stringently in this regard. Unauthorised dumps only serve to pass on the problem. People are not taking responsibility for their own waste and there is a need for a greater degree of education on the issue.</P>
    <P>I compliment all concerned with the national spring clean campaign. During the course of local and European election canvassing in recent weeks, I noticed waste containers located in the centre of many housing estates. Considerable efforts are being made to dispose of rubbish which has been accumulating over the years. I would like to see provision made for such a clean out on an annual basis, rather than have rubbish unceremoniously dumped in the countryside.</P>
    <P>With just over a week to go to the local and European elections, posters are to be seen everywhere throughout the country. Most posters are taken down on the night of polling day. Politicians and political parties ensure that posters are taken down quickly, if for no other reason than the Opposition might use it against them if they were not. Healthy competition exists to see which party takes posters down first and we should encourage that.</P>
    <P>Most provincial towns now have glass recycling banks which assist greatly in the reduction of waste. Recycling reduces waste, and the use of landfill sites should be encouraged, whether through the education system, the political system or local authorities. I have been involved in discussions with people who have tried to recycle plastic. That type of recycling is difficult as it is uneconomical but it should be encouraged where possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a short contribution to this debate because huge difficulties are being experienced with waste and waste disposal in north Munster. Campaigns are currently being waged in Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary about the location of a regional landfill site. In my constituency, this issue has given rise to hysteria in local communities. People are very upset about the proposal to locate a landfill site within their parishes, particularly when they have been working hard to encourage people to clean up the environment.</P>
      <P>Groups in County Clare have successfully contested the proposed location of a landfill site at Doora by Clare County Council. Consequently, the county council must find an alternative. The three possible alternative sites which were chosen were rejected for various reasons. One was rejected because of the exertion of political pressure, a second was rejected on the basis of archaeological concerns and there is a risk in regard to the third site that the Inagh river, a good salmon river, could be polluted in the long run, although this site may yet be chosen. The Minister must invest substantially in local authorities in order to ensure long-term planning in this area.</P>
      <P>The Doora facility would have been closed after a certain period of time. However, the regional partnership aspect has not been fully explored. It is left to individual members on authorities to make the decision, but then the NIMBY factor comes into play. A more imaginative approach to landfill sites has to be pursued by the Government.</P>
      <P>Substantial investment in the primary school sector is necessary also. Clare County Council encouraged pilot schemes in national schools but it ran out of funds. That national school scheme helped to promote the idea of recycling. Under the scheme, four or five recycling bins were provided in each school for glass, plastic and other waste products. There is a disproportionate increase in the amount of waste created annually, and if this recycling programme is not pursued, particularly through education, the tourism industry will face enormous difficulty in the future.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of visiting national parks in the United States last year. During that visit I saw young children buy wrapped ice cream on a mountain &ndash; it was very warm &ndash; and not one piece of paper was thrown on the ground. The problem did not arise because there were people supervising visitors to the park, and also the youngsters knew that throwing ice cream sticks and bits of paper on the ground would not enhance their national park.</P>

    <P>There are other national parks on the west coast which are used extensively by people from San Francisco and other cities. At the weekend, volunteers clean the beaches along the coast. That attitude does not exist in the psyche of people in this country. People will not volunteer <Col N="1552" /> to clean up parks and beaches at weekends. Americans believe in the value of cleanliness and providing a clean environment for tourists, and the west coast has the highest numbers of tourists. It would be valuable for the Government to become heavily involved in waste management. Since the Minister has made seat belts in cars compulsory, why does he not make it compulsory to have a litter bag in every car?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for raising this important matter. Local authorities are under enormous pressure regarding the issue of litter. As a member of a local authority, I believe there is an urgent need for massive investment to ensure the problem of litter does not become an albatross that we cannot handle. Monaghan County Council, together with Cavan, Meath and Louth, is preparing a strategic plan to deal with this problem. One of the problems that arises even from an open discussion on such a plan is that as soon as an area is identified as suitable to deal with waste, there is immediate uproar. This is an increasing problem for local councils and, through them, for the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>This motion deals only with domestic waste, but I want to talk about the more serious problem we are experiencing in County Monaghan. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and anybody else dealing with the problem of waste in Monaghan, will be aware that two thirds of all poultry and mushrooms are produced in County Monaghan, particularly in the north of the county. This has caused a serious problem in terms of pollution. The planning authorities can no longer give planning permission to farmers who want to become involved in this major industry. As we all know, we can only go forwards or backwards, we cannot stand still. If new structures are not allowed, the industry will die.</P>
      <P>There is need for investment and co-operation among the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Minister's Department. We have had enough committees and seminars, we now want action. This is important to farm families' income but also to the major factories such as Grove Turkeys, Monaghan Poultry, Monaghan Mushrooms, Cartons of Shercock, Provinder Millers and all the other groups involved in job creation in the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fiberwatt UK, a company that provides power using farm waste, operates three power stations in the area. These have been visited by Members of the Dáil and senior officials and have been shown to be the answer to the problem of waste disposal. One station operates in the middle of a village without any problem. Fiberwatt UK, along with a Monaghan business family, made an offer to build a station in Monaghan but, unfortunately, they were beaten by an American consortium which was to build a major power station just north of the M50 in north County Dublin. As far as I am aware, that project has not gone ahead <Col N="1553" /> and the three Departments I mentioned must get together to ensure that jobs are maintained in Monaghan and that the environment is improved as a result. The Department of Agriculture and Food has an interest in the production and quality of food, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has an interest in maintaining a clean environment and the Department of Public Enterprise has an interest in producing electricity from natural resources. This is a natural resource as far as Monaghan is concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government and anyone else who wishes to listen to get the different groups together to ensure that a power station of this nature goes ahead in the Border region. It may be possible to unite with some of the poultry units in Tyrone, Armagh and elsewhere. If that is not done, it will have serious consequences for the industry and tourism. I hope this problem can be resolved in the near future because it has been left unresolved for too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. It is appropriate that we are discussing waste management here in Dáil Éireann in the middle of a local election campaign because that problem is foremost in the minds of people throughout the country, particularly in my own constituency of east Galway where no less than four communities are outraged at the proposals presented to them over the past few months. It is unfortunate that this issue has been brought to a head due to the lack of forward planning by Galway City Corporation. In the past, Galway prided itself on being the fastest growing city in Europe, but it has to admit that it failed dismally to adequately provide for the management of its waste. When the corporation was brought before the High Court this time last year, it was literally damned by the judge who criticised it for its total lack of forward thinking and its inability to manage waste. The judge should have known that no local authority has ever adequately managed its waste. Local authorities have dumped the waste and abandoned sites. Ministers have failed to adequately finance local authorities to rehabilitate those abandoned sites. The Minister's reply to my parliamentary question earlier this year highlighted the fact that the Department has, to a degree, abandoned waste management.</P>
      <P>Are we serious about waste management plans? When local authorities failed to properly collect refuse they allowed private enterprise to do the job adequately. Householders and business people have paid dearly for the inefficient manner in which local authorities provided this service in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Business people are paying rates at 35p plus in the pound and also have to pay a refuse collection tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of Galway Corporation's failure to manage its waste, an agreement was reached between the corporation and the council to bring all the waste from the city and county to Ballin<Col N="1554" /> asloe which they believed to be the only suitable landfill site remaining in the county. This led to the appalling situation where the county council and the corporation engaged the services of the national waste management specialists, MC O'Sullivan Consultants, and their agent, PJ Rudden, who delivers the bad news to various communities. These people have done nothing but provide a desktop report. What led them to conclude that the only three suitable sites were in east Galway at Kilrickle, New Inn and Newbridge? However, they concluded that, not only had these sites the potential for handling local waste, but they also had the potential of being regional sites.</P>
    <P>We now have the added dimension of the proposal for an incinerator in or adjacent to Galway city. Five communities in County Galway are driven daft by a report which has no basis other than being concocted by consultants sitting at their desks. Anyone who knows the topography of the areas suggested would realise that they are totally unsuitable for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are now taking legal proceeding against communities to the High Court at great expense to these people who are determined that their livelihoods, homesteads and farmland will not be destroyed. The Minister must direct local authorities to cease taking court proceedings against innocent communities who face huge costs in their determination to protect their property. Are the consultants to be similar to judges and lawyers at the tribunals and become rich as a result? I plead with the Minister to direct local authorities to stop bringing communities to court and to consult with them so that some reasonable compromise can be reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important issues facing the nation and I commend Deputies Dukes, Clune and Hayes for bringing it before the House. When in Opposition, the Minister had great ideas for controlling the use and abuse of plastic bags. However, we have not seen much of these proposals since he became Minister. Is he going to ban or control the use of plastic bags as he promised to do in his election manifesto?</P>
      <P>Ireland is far behind the rest of Europe in terms of recycling. We recycle 37 per cent of glass whereas the figure in Holland is 80 per cent. Some positive measures could be adopted in the recycling process. It may be an idea to incorporate a recycling unit into plans for new housing estates and industrial units. Our planning guidelines do not include any provisions for recycling units. We are building sprawling housing estates and industrial units without considering the concept of recycling. This suggestion should be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not good at segregating waste. The Minister and the Government should raise national awareness of waste segregation and transform that awareness into action by encouraging each household to segregate waste. Local authorities should facilitate this segregation as <Col N="1555" /> there is no point in households doing so if the binmen throw all the waste into one container.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we all had small bins outside our houses, now we have large wheely bins. Some houses in Cobh have 17 or 18 steps leading up to them and residents have to drag wheely bins up and down those steps as so much waste is being produced. Has the Minister any proposals to cut down on the amount of packaging being produced? If one buys a tube of toothpaste it is in a cardboard box. Is there any need for this? Surely the box is superficial and can we not cut down on this amount of waste? Changing Our Ways is a document full of aspirations. However, as Deputy Dukes pointed out, there is no progress evident after the Government's two years in office. The situation is getting worse.</P>
    <P>There are many lovely beaches in my local area. When tourists flock to the beaches at this time of year they find to their horror that they are filthy. Much of this waste is dumped by people visiting the beaches because local authorities do not have the resources, the wherewithal or the will to clean the beaches. Some of the waste is washed ashore and we need to tackle the issue of waste being dumped at sea by ships. Do we have facilities at ports to dispose of waste? If a ship docks at a US port it must produce the waste to show that it was not dumped overboard. That is not the case here and waste is being dumped overboard at sea and washed ashore. The Minister should take steps to ensure that at least our beaches are kept clean.</P>
    <P>We are far behind the rest of Europe in this regard and we need to catch up quickly. I am aware of an industrialist who recently passed through some towns trying to decide in which town he should locate. He passed through early on a Sunday morning. Unfortunately, the chippers had been in business the night before and, needless to say, he found it difficult to make his decision because every street was littered with chip bags, paper and other litter.</P>
    <P>The problem of waste is impacting across the nation in all its aspects. We must start dealing with it at primary school level. I have no wish to overload teachers &ndash; they have enough to do &ndash; but we must promote waste awareness in primary schools. Children must be taught not to dump waste. If one drives past any school after break time one will see litter and waste scattered in the street. It is important to make an impact on school children. Perhaps something could be done to encourage schools, for example, through competitions between them based on the environment around the school.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleagues for bringing this motion before the House and I urge the Minister to act swiftly on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Dukes on bringing this important issue before the House. Numerous small dumps are closing as stringent <Col N="1556" /> new waste management regulations come into force. Dump closures combined with the new regime are exerting pressure for the prompt creation of bigger, better managed facilities on greenfield sites or for the expansion of existing landfill sites.</P>
      <P>Many communities, faced with expanding or new county or city service dumps planned near them, refuse to accept the new licences offered by the EPA. The Waste Management Act, 1996, and the new EU landfill directive were intended to herald a new, environmentally sound way of disposing of waste. Under the new legislative framework, every local and regional authority is obliged to furnish a comprehensive waste management plan, embracing a greater emphasis on recycling.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said it is hoped that local authorities will co-operate. They must co-operate in the management and disposal of waste. Waste Management Ireland has been making a strong pitch for county and city waste disposal from local authorities in the west, mid-west and midlands. The Minister has indicated on previous occasions that public-private partnerships will be the way forward. However, it is a huge business. As Deputy Stanton said, there is a huge responsibility to put in place the necessary controls for private operators. Large landfill sites will definitely be needed in the future because for many years there was no overall policy for the management of waste.</P>
      <P>Rehab Ireland is doing an outstanding job through its location of recycling bins in the car parks of densely populated areas. People are becoming more educated about the benefits of recycling. The sorting of refuse is also a difficult business.</P>
      <P>Promotion in schools is most important. The issue of refuse charges has become an important election issue, particularly the charges on business people. As Deputy Burke correctly pointed out, the only people who are liable for rates at present are business people. In addition, they are also obliged to pay considerable charges for refuse disposal. A skip can cost up to £80 per week. In some cases it might be emptied twice per week which means a cost of £160 per week. That adds up to more than £7,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The role of private operators is extremely important. The Minister of State indicated that there would be North-South co-operation on waste management. Under the Good Friday Agreement, there is such a possibility.</P>

      <P>The number of landfill sites in the Republic has been reduced from 115 to 85 in recent years. So far, the EPA has issued only four licences for dumps because almost every draft licence is being appealed by objectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How and where to deal with waste in the future is a major problem. It demands a management <Col N="1557" /> strategy. Approximately 92 per cent of all waste is put in landfill sites in Ireland while in Europe 18 per cent of waste is incinerated. There is a fear of the incineration option in Ireland, but with the proper investment and the right location and given that the ash can be recycled for use in the construction of roads, it is an alternative the Minister should consider. Given that since 1996, when the new controls were introduced, only four licences were issued by the EPA, incineration signals the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Green Party spokesperson on waste, I support this motion and thank Fine Gael for the 120 seconds I have been allocated to speak on it. I congratulate the charities, local communities and households which are at present composting, bringing their bags of cans and other waste to Kerbside, using bottle banks and co-ordinating the waste for recycling in large institutions, such as St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview. I congratulate Jim Owens who recently announced an initiative there.</P>
      <P>In contrast, this Government and, indeed, its predecessor have the necessary power to prohibit waste generation. There is a mighty Waste Management Act in addition to other legislation. Section 29 of that Act gives the Minister powers to provide for various matters, including requirements on the nature of waste, to specify certain designs in packaging and to prohibit, limit or control waste importation, distribution, supply, sale and so forth. The Minister has numerous powers and I urge him to use them.</P>
      <P>Let us take the glass milk bottle as an example. Glanbia, or Premier Dairies as it was known in Dublin, is scrapping its bottling plant. However, in Cork 13,000 houses have milk delivered in glass bottles each morning and over 60 per cent of the 200 Cork schools receiving milk receive it in glass bottles. This prevents a large amount of waste in carbons and plastic.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the power to tell Glanbia to bring back the glass milk bottle and I urge him to use that power. He also has the power to tax plastic bags, as was promised in the election manifesto. Why has he not used that power? I urge him to ban Repak. It is not doing the job it committed itself to do. The Minister should use the regulations at his disposal.</P>
      <P>I call on people who cannot get the glass milk bottle anymore to send their milk cartons to Glanbia or, indeed, to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the <Col N="1558" /> Deputies who tabled this motion. While I do not agree with its terms, I welcome the fact that waste management and the problem of litter are highlighted in the House. That is most important.</P>
      <P>In support of the proposed amendment to the motion, my colleague, Deputy Dan Wallace, outlined in considerable detail the substantial progress which has been made in waste and litter management over the past two years. The nature of the contribution by the Opposition to this debate suggests a wilful disregard of the facts presented.</P>
      <P>I will resist the temptation to outline again what is happening and will continue to happen in this area. It is striking, however, that the Opposition accepts that in the Waste Management and Litter Pollution Acts and the subordinate regulations there is an excellent legislative framework and foundation for action. The policy statement, Changing our Ways, which I published last October, was not faulted; it was, indeed, complimented by several speakers. It was acknowledged that the objectives and targets outlined in that statement would be hard to beat. The thrust of Opposition criticism centred on generalised assertions that the Government is not providing leadership, is not putting pressure on local authorities and is not serious about getting results. I reject each of these criticisms.</P>
      <P>It was noticeable that no specific proposals were advanced which are not already being addressed or undertaken, except perhaps the suggestion by Deputy Sargent to increase the litter in Dublin by dumping all milk cartons&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is giving firm leadership and clear policy direction to local authorities, public agencies, businesses and the public. We have identified the problems to be tackled, decided on the appropriate actions to be taken and the targets to be reached. We are now engaged in driving the necessary change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable debate about locally based waste management solutions. Local authorities are concluding a regionally based planning process which will provide a basis for the delivery of integrated waste services and infrastructure to meet modern waste management needs and facilitate the achievement of our objectives. Deputy Dukes was concerned about our commitment to the rationalisation of the municipal landfill network in light of proposals for new landfills around the country. Even with the provision of significant biological and thermal treatment capacity, which he endorses and I welcome, there will always be a need for residual landfill capacity. The planning process should <Col N="1559" /> ensure that such developments are consistent with the integrated regional approaches being pursued by the majority of local authorities.</P>
    <P>If there was one weakness in the Waste Management Act, 1996, it was that it laid an undue emphasis on local authorities acting on an individual basis. That is not a criticism of the previous Minister, because we were all party to that. I was in Opposition at the time as was Deputy Sargent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not accept my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional approach is now being adopted as a result of my policy initiative last October.</P>
      <P>Where significant new waste facilities are proposed, whether they involve thermal treatment or residual landfill, they will be subject to the requirements of planning legislation and to waste licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency. This stringent licensing system will ensure high standards of environmental protection apply to all such facilities.</P>
      <P>I refute the allegation that the Government is doing nothing to combat litter, although I agree it remains a huge problem in many parts of the country. It is a blight on the landscape and I have repeatedly said that over the past two years. It is a shame on us all. The primary response to the litter problem must come from the local authorities using the extensive powers available to them under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. Local authority enforcement action has improved substantially since the introduction of the 1997 Act. However, I would be the first to admit that is from a low base and that much more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>The Government is also taking measures to support more effective local authority action against litter. As already outlined, a national litter pollution monitoring system will be fully operational by autumn. The objective is to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action. A key feature of the system will be the review of local litter management plans. The An Taisce led project, National Spring Clean 1999, with financial support from my Department and commercial sponsors, ran nationwide during the month of April and was a tremendous success. I commend everyone associated with it. We have invited representatives of local authorities, the business community, the educational and tourist sectors, environmental NGOs and community and Tidy Towns groups to participate in a new national anti-litter forum to review existing actions targeting litter pollution, to develop a programme of measures to enhance and extend those responses and, it is hoped, to provide financial support for those efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> I have not heard anything which gives any substance to the motion tabled. We have made major progress in waste and litter management over the past two years. In terms of policy and legislative development, planning, public awareness and involvement, support for local authorities, waste licensing and implementation of producer responsibility initiatives, we are far advanced from the situation which previously prevailed. I reject the motion and support the amendment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will receive £126 million more than they received in 1997. Part of that additional funding is specifically earmarked for environmental activities to allow them enforce the regulations and clean up their act generally in litter and environmental matters. The Government is committed to a strong waste management policy which it is pursuing. While it is necessary to highlight the bad, we should also acknowledge the good work done by many towns and villages throughout the country through the Tidy Towns competition.</P>

      <P>No county in Ireland knows as much about tidy towns as County Longford. Ardagh was successful on three occasions and Newtowncashel was also successful. However, like every other county, it has a problem with illegal dumping. The Minister informed us he will establish a representative body to consult about the major problem of litter. Litter is the first thing visitors notice when they arrive in Ireland. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the body does not become another talking shop. We have had too many of those and I hope this will not become another one.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department should spearhead a special effort to clean up Ireland for the millennium. That cannot be done without providing sufficient resources and making an all-out effort to clean up the country once and for all. When one travels the roads, be it by the edge of a forest or by the side of a bog, one notices the drains are always full of litter. It is unbelievable. People ask what the local council is doing about it but it is not guilty of dumping litter, the people are. A school awareness programme, something certain areas have, is a positive step towards instilling in young people's minds the notion that they should keep the country clean and tidy and that they should be proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a man who collects bottles from pubs and hotels for recycling, but there is not sixpence worth of aid for such people in the private sector. The Minister should examine that and encourage people involved in recycling projects. Other countries sort their litter for recycling but we are only skimming the surface in that regard. The Minister should concentrate on that. Local authorities in the midlands have come together to tackle the <Col N="1561" /> waste problem and I hope they make progress. Waste is on the increase in the consumer society, so it should be matched by waste management.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will follow up on the points I raised. I am pleased to say that next Sunday, when some will be counting the votes for the European elections, the President will be in Ardagh presenting the Tidy Towns competition awards, and I hope Ardagh will win again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be associated with the motion. It is appropriate, given our recent experience when canvassing. Many people are concerned at the lack of facilities for dealing with waste. We cannot seem to move away from our dependence on landfill. The Waste Management Act, 1996, is wonderful legislation, as is the Government's latest proposal, Waste &ndash; Changing Our Ways. However, they seem to be aspirational documents which have no connection with reality and no impact on our waste management practices. We still depend on landfill.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act was produced in response to the EU waste management strategy which placed primary emphasis on waste minimisation. However, that Act, the key to a successful waste management strategy, has not been implemented. Instead, as a result of increased consumerism, even greater volumes of waste are being produced each year. There is no indication that the mountains of waste we produce are being reduced.</P>
      <P>A total of 42 million tonnes of waste is produced each year or approximately 400 kilograms for every individual in this country. Eleven million tonnes of this is made up of industrial, commercial and domestic waste and the figure continues to rise annually. Everything is now packaged and double wrapped. Take away foods, pizza boxes, burgers and convenience foods that are microwaveable in the container all contribute enormously to the waste mountain, which continues to grow at an alarming rate.</P>
      <P>The problem of packaging waste must be addressed. This has been done successfully in other countries but we do not appear to be able to come to terms with it. Everyone has received circulars from Repak Limited which does not seem to be successful. The companies which are obliged to register with it have not done so and local authorities are not pursuing them to ensure their compliance in this regard. Packaging regulations are not being implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, referred to the many wonderful initiatives put in place by the Government. He emphasised that waste management is a matter for the relevant local authorities, but this is not so. Local authorities cannot encourage recycling if the necessary infrastructure is not put in place by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> When in Opposition Fianna Fáil proposed the introduction of a tax on plastic bags to discourage their use and a refund scheme for PET bottles and aluminium drink cans. Why can we not introduce a tax on plastic bags? It would discourage their use because people would reuse them or refuse to accept them while out shopping. There is no need to give a plastic bag to someone buying a pint of milk because it is perfectly safe to carry it in its original container.</P>
    <P>Double packaging should be banned. There is no need to place tubes of toothpaste in boxes, to have two wrappers on chocolate bars or to wrap shoes in paper, box them and place them in plastic bags. Such packaging is unnecessary. I recently visited Germany where people use cloth shopping bags and refuse to have their goods put in boxes, wrapped in paper or placed in plastic bags because they are charged for the disposal of such packaging. Charges of that kind discourage over-packaging and the waste it generates. The Minister stated that nothing of substance has been put forward by the proposers of the motion, but we have outlined a number of positive proposals he could accept.</P>
    <P>Construction and demolition waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the country. It results from new building construction and is comprised of pieces of concrete blocks, bricks and concrete and the waste generated by the renovation and demolition of buildings. It is estimated that up to 50 per cent of the waste in Ballyeally dump in north Dublin comes from building sites. This waste stream has not been addressed. It was mentioned in the Minister's recent policy document, Changing our Ways, but there has been no action on the ground.</P>
    <P>Construction and demolition waste is very economical because it can be crushed and used as a filling material, as a foundation for roads etc. It has numerous uses and huge volumes of it are being deposited daily in landfill dumps. The construction sector, which is experiencing high growth rates, has made some efforts to deal with this waste stream but it continues to grow unchecked and unchallenged. Many documents have been produced which offer interesting and varied approaches to the problem.</P>
    <P>Why not make it a condition that every planning application should incorporate proposals for the use of recycled aggregates and material in order to address the problem of the waste generated on construction sites? Why does the Government not take the lead on this issue and ensure that all contractors working on State projects use recycled materials and implement waste reduction policies? Positive steps of this nature, while they will not solve the problem, would go some way towards addressing it. They would represent a 100 per cent improvement on what we have at present, namely, nothing.</P>
    <P>Some 90 per cent of all commercial and domestic waste is deposited in landfill dumps. We have one of the lowest recycling rates in Europe. The annual competitiveness report produced by <Col N="1563" /> Forfás states that the reuse of materials through recycling activities measures both the efficiency of the economy as a whole in reducing costs and the contribution made by the economy to the conservation of depleted resources. If that is the case, it appears Ireland holds a very low position in this regard.</P>
    <P>We do not address recycling and its merits in any meaningful fashion. Our recycling initiatives depend on voluntary schemes which involve individuals transporting their recyclables to collection points. This practice will not achieve the ambitious recycling target set in the Government's review. We must consider the markets for these recyclable materials. Why do English newspapers proudly display the amount of recycled paper which went into their production? At present, our contribution to recycling newsprint is to use it for animal bedding. That is not recycling, it is merely finding another use for the product.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that it is cheaper to use virgin paper than it is to use recycled paper. However, if we are serious about sustainable development &ndash; this involves current development which will not have a negative impact on future generations &ndash; we must intervene economically to encourage the use of recycled paper. There is no collection point in Cork city for used paper or newspapers because there is no market for those materials. If it were obligatory to use a certain percentage of recycled materials, the market would develop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> Smurfit Recycling has stated that it has reduced by 40 per cent the recovery rate of corrugated cases and packaging materials in the past 18 months. The price of aluminium cans has dropped in the past year from £850 per tonne to less than £500. As a result, a number of small firms which had collected those cans are faced with the prospect of going out of business. These firms paid children who collected aluminium cans in school 50p per bag. That was successful both in business terms and in helping to ensure that this product was recycled.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to glass recycling, in respect of which our record is good. However, we must do more because we remain far behind our European counterparts in this area.</P>
    <P>Many of the documents which have been produced are aspirational. Given that we recycle only between 8 and 10 per cent of our waste, how does the Minister propose to bridge the gap between that and the proposed target of 50 per cent? Many speakers referred to the problem of litter which must be addressed through the introduction of new initiatives. I accept that we are moving some way towards addressing this problem but there is a need for further action.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House challenges the Minister to implement the Waste Management Act, the packaging regulations and the Litter Act. We need to see more action on the ground rather than the introduction of further aspirational documents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The senior citizens of Tralee are seeking a district hospital which will cater for older people who require long-term care close to their homes, friends and relatives; post-operative patients who need convalescent care and those who need residential hospice care. Currently, they must go to St. Columbanus Home, Killarney, which, although an excellent district hospital, is considered too far away for the elderly people of Tralee to travel and for family and friends to visit.</P>
      <P>In many cases they are unable to travel because of disabilities, old age, etc. A purpose built unit is needed in Tralee for the care of the elderly within reasonable reach of the general hospital so that they will have access to the facilities there. It would make a great deal of sense if a district hospital were located on the grounds of the general hospital because many facilities and services provided by the general hospital could also be made available to the district hospital. That certainly would reduce expense.</P>
      <P>Senior citizens comprise a significant segment of the population in Tralee. According to the 1996 census report, Tralee had a population of 19,056 &ndash; obviously this figure has increased substantially since &ndash; and of that figure, 18 per cent were aged 65 or over; in County Kerry 14 per cent of the population was over 65 years. This means that in 1996 2,349 people in this area were aged 65 or over. The population of Tralee has increased significantly since as more people have moved in from the country.</P>
      <P>Previous efforts to get a district hospital for Tralee have ended in failure. Efforts to have the former St. Catherine's Hospital converted to a district hospital failed some years ago and that building now houses Kerry County Council offices. An excellent convalescent home was closed by the health board in the days of the Haughey health cuts in 1987. It was closed for no reason in the name of fiscal rectitude and when one considers now what went on at that time it makes the decision even more farcical and hard to understand.</P>
      <P>As a result, the senior citizens of Tralee must now travel outside their own town and away from their relatives and friends to the facilities in Killarney. Their representatives have come to the conclusion that the health board executives are determined to ignore their pleas for a community hospital in Tralee. Mr. Sean Hurley, chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board, stated on 26 March that a central element of the board's philosophy of services for the older person is to provide services as close as possible to the older person's home, in other words, it was the health board's philosophy to provide facilities as near as possible to their homes for old people living in Tralee. I am asking the Minister of State for an indication that it is the Department's intention to urge the health board to provide this much needed facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Southern Health Board's priority development for services for the elderly in County Kerry was the establishment of a department of medicine for the elderly in Tralee General Hospital. Funding for this development was provided by my Department to the board in 1997 and 1998. The development of the department of medicine for the elderly com<Col N="1567" /> menced with the appointment of a consultant physician with an interest in medicine for the elderly in January 1998. The establishment of the department included the appointment of additional nursing, medical and paramedical staff to the hospital. Following these appointments, an assessment and rehabilitation unit for the elderly has now been established in the hospital.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a department of medicine for the elderly in County Kerry is a strategic step towards the attainment of the aim of the national health strategy of providing appropriate care in the appropriate setting. The experience of existing specialist geriatric departments throughout the country shows that they restore the majority of patients to independent living quickly, they reduce admissions to continuing care beds and reduce pressure on other acute hospital beds.</P>
      <P>The level of continuing care beds in the Tralee catchment area has not been reduced by the development of the department of medicine for the elderly. In addition to continuing care beds provided in Tralee General Hospital itself, the Southern Health Board has contracted with private nursing homes in the area to ensure that the same level of continuing care beds remains available for public patients.</P>
      <P>The next priority development in relation to services for older people in the Tralee area is the establishment of a day hospital attached to the department of medicine for the elderly in Tralee General Hospital and the Southern Health Board is at present drawing up plans for this development. The Southern Health Board has an existing plan to develop the capital infrastructure of its existing community hospitals. This plan has prioritised the need for extensions to Schull and Kanturk Community Hospitals and the replacement of Dingle Community Hospital. At its August 1998 meeting the board agreed to a notice of motion that it would include a district hospital for Tralee among its list of priorities and it is finalising a strategy for services for older people which has as its central aim the improved health and quality of life for older people in Cork and Kerry. This strategy will address the continuing care needs of the population of Cork and Kerry. Tralee is one of four urban areas in the Southern Health board area that does not have a community hospital facility at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has injected an additional £7 million per annum into the capital programme for services for older people and projects are ongoing in all health board areas. It is accepted that a community hospital is needed in Tralee and I am confident that when the Southern Health Board has completed the day hospital I referred to earlier, it will take into account the requirement for a community hospital in Tralee in determining its future services for the older population of Tralee and its environs.<Col N="1568" /></P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Quality of Drinking Water.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The timeframe in which we deal with any issue is a reflection of how serious we feel the matter is. The quality of our drinking water affects the health and quality of life of everyone in the country &ndash; young and old, resident and tourist, politicians and electorate. The EPA report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland in 1997 was not published until some weeks ago and it stated that of the 5,500 group water schemes serving 150,000 households, less than 20 per cent are tested for quality probably only once during the year. Of the 80,000 private water supplies, less than half of 1 per cent were tested, with virtually all of them breaching EU drinking water regulations. The overall quality of Irish water is said to be good but this hides the fact that water is generally very good in urban areas and generally bad in rural areas.</P>
      <P>In terms of water purification regimes used in Ireland, it is interesting to note that the EPA does not know what water purification regime, if any, is used in 87 per cent of group water schemes and private supplies tested. When and if water is treated, it mostly involves the addition of chlorine to the water. The EPA report recommends that minimum quantities of chlorine be added to water during treatment because excessive levels contribute greatly to odour and taste problems.</P>
      <P>Are there greener alternatives to chlorine? I believe there are. One of these has been available to the rest of the world for almost a century. It was first used in France in 1898 and is in operation in hundreds of water treatment facilities around the world. It is in extensive use in the United States, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries. It is known as ozone purification and, as far as I am aware, very few people in the water treatment business in Ireland know much about it, apart from a small start-up company I recently discovered and staff at our single ozone treatment plant in the west. There is a compelling health reason, apart from odour and taste, why ozone is reducing the amounts of chlorine used around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1970s it was discovered that chlorine produced extremely dangerous by-products called trihalomethanes, generally known as THMs. They are produced when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water such as leaves, fish, algae, etc. THMs cause cancer and double the risk of serious birth defects and early term miscarriage. As a result of this discovery, the health and water authorities in many countries introduced ozone purification into their water treatment processes to rid their water supplies of organic matter and other contaminants, thereby reducing the quantity of chlorine required. This, in turn, reduced the levels of THMs and risk to public health. Ozone is merely activated oxygen. It is a gas with a half life of minutes which can be more than 3,000 times more effective as a sterilising agent than chlorine and any excess unutilised ozone in <Col N="1569" /> water turns back into oxygen. Ozone is being adopted worldwide as a green solution. It was first used in France in 1898, long before the Green Party arrived on the political scene.</P>
    <P>We test for THMs in our water but that was done only 142 times in 1997, covering 1,005 public schemes, 5,500 group water schemes and 80,000 private wells. In some US water schemes, water is tested for THMs every two hours. The tests carried out in 1997 showed that in 15 cases THMs were at or above 75 parts per billion, the threshold which, in the United States, would have triggered a public health warning to expectant mothers not to drink tap water. However, the issue was not deemed serious enough to warrant action and the results of the test were not made public until two years later. The test for THMs are carried out by the sanitary authorities but the water samples must be sent to the UK for analysis. It is difficult to understand why our accredited State laboratories cannot carry out these tests.</P>
    <P>We are falling behind the rest of the world in terms of testing, treating and delivering quality drinking water, particularly in rural Ireland. I hope I have convinced the Minister that this matter is not being taken seriously enough by those in a position to do something about it. The evidence of our THMs and the fact that we are only now beginning to discuss this matter, 30 years after corrective action was taken by other countries are causes of concern.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister responsible to investigate this matter with a view to initiating corrective action this year so that we can reinstate ourselves as the clean air and clean water capital of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf. The Minister has asked me to inform the House of the comprehensive measures he is taking to improve the present standards.</P>
      <P>Rural water quality problems are most acute in the case of group water schemes dependent on private sources, many of which are vulnerable to organic pollution. The EPA report on drinking water quality in 1997 recorded a significant reduction over previous years in the number of schemes failing to comply with the required standards, but the volume of schemes still found not to be satisfactory &ndash; 36 per cent of those dependent on private sources &ndash; leaves no room for complacency. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, with the local authorities and the group scheme sector, is addressing the problems with the greatest possible urgency and with record levels of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1999 rural water programme, as originally announced, included £11.5 million for the development of new and upgraded group schemes and for essential improvement works in preparation for group schemes being integrated with the public water supply system. Last Friday <Col N="1570" /> the Minister announced that the 1999 provision is being increased by a further £5 million to an unprecedented £16.5 million, with the increase being specially targeted at improving poor water quality. County Cork alone has been allocated an additional £200,000 for these measures.</P>
    <P>This year also saw the introduction of a special new £3 million package to develop practical solutions to the water quality problems, particularly affecting privately sourced group schemes. This package is being used to research the factors that affect water quality at the source and in the distribution system, to identify all available package treatment plants that would be suitable for use in the group sector and to pay for the installation and practical pilot testing of new technologies under a range of real operating conditions in group schemes.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister established the rural water monitoring committee to advise his Department on rural water supply policy and to monitor the implementation by local authorities of the various capital measures under the rural water programme. The committee is representative of the local authorities, the private group scheme sector, other rural organisations and the Department. The Minister asked the committee to draw up a model strategic rural water plan to provide a blueprint for the development of rural water supplies on a countywide basis. The objective was to ensure that rural water supply policy is properly planned and focused and that it is organised and carried out in a spirit of partnership between the public and non-statutory sectors that recognises the important role of group schemes.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the plan was completed and presented to the Minister in the past few days. It includes a step by step guide for compiling the county plans which, for the first time, will set out an agreed approach, based on sound economic and engineering principles, and bringing good quality water supplies to all rural areas, whether by extension of existing networks or from new sources. The National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the umbrella organisation for the group scheme sector, plays a key role in promoting awareness of water quality and best practice in the operation and management of group schemes. The Department of the Environment and Local Government's annual grant to the federation for its education and development programme has also been more than doubled this year to give it the resources it needs to bring the quality message home at local level.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been provided by the Government for the setting up of regional training centres around the country where specialist courses and facilities are being provided to cater for the training needs of people in the group scheme sector, especially those involved in the management and operation of supply systems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern will agree that additional funding, technical measures, formal training and the rural water management plans represent a com<Col N="1571" /> prehensive and substantial response by the Government to the water quality problems confronting rural consumers. The Minister is confident that the steps he is taking will continue to bring about rapid progress in eliminating problems.</P>
    <P>The 1997 EPA report shows that the breaches in standards that occurred were generally not extreme. They can be quickly and easily rectified <Col N="1572" /> by better management coupled with suitable disinfection facilities. There are problems that need to be solved, but they are far from insurmountable and are being tackled vigorously.</P>
    <P>I will bring to the Minister's attention what the Deputy has said regarding ozone treatment and THMs.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 June 1999.</P>

      <Quest>the possibility of extending the free travel scheme by providing social welfare recipients with free or special rate air travel on spare capacity on our national airline services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14403/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and since last April, free travel will be available to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. The full year cost of the free travel scheme for 1999 is approximately £34.5 million and at the end of April 1999, over 538,000 free travel passes had been issued.</P>
    <P>In general the scheme provides for travel within the State and is intended to help and encourage those eligible to remain active within their communities. Extending the scheme to cover air travel has not arisen except in the context of services to the Aran Islands and Tory Island which are covered by the free travel arrangements.</P>
    <P>The question of providing concessions to older people travelling outside the country is one which is being dealt with at EU level. At the end of 1997 Age Concern England completed a study on the question of a European pass for senior citizens which would grant a wide range of concessions including transport across the European Union. This was undertaken with the support of the EU Commission. I understand that the EU Commission is currently considering this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the commitments <Col N="1574" /> made prior to the 1997 general election was to address the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. The group referred to by the Deputy were marginally excluded from entitlement to an old age (contributory) pension as they were aged 56 or over when compulsory social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988. These people could not, therefore, satisfy the governing qualifying condition of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>In delivering our commitment, I examined various options in arriving at a formula that would address the specific problem faced by this group of pensioners. Of these I considered that a flat-rate payment of a special old age (contributory) pension was the most equitable and practical way of addressing the situation, taking account of all the circumstances. It represents very good value for money for all the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, new arrangements now apply for those self-employed who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years reckonable contributions paid since then. As the Deputy has pointed out, payment will be made at a flat rate of 50 per cent of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to the pension will be created from 9 April 1999. However, to carry out the necessary examination of claims and to ensure that refunds of contributions already made are recouped, claims will actually be put into payment from 15 October 1999. Arrears of payment from April to October, where due, will be paid at that stage. Title will also give access to the free schemes, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is, I believe, important to stress that this special arrangement represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this group of people found themselves. The rationale behind the five year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers. I consider this threshold to be eminently fair, reflecting as it does a certain consistency of commitment to the social insurance fund over a given period of time.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, it appears, according to the records of my Department, that he will qualify under the new arrangements. Accordingly, the pension services office will be in touch with him directly to formally confirm his entitlement.</P>

      <P>Pilot projects to enhance information services for families are being developed in three local offices of my Department &ndash; Waterford, Cork and Finglas in Dublin. The projects build on the one-stop shop concept with the aim of providing improved access to information for families through the social welfare local offices. The service will be available to all families in the localities.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the family services project is to provide a high quality information service about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and from the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on the services available locally.</P>
      <P>The expanded range of family services on which information will be available includes marriage counselling and marriage preparation programmes, bereavement counselling and support services, information about parenting issues, including local childcare services where this information is available, and the state family mediation service.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to develop within the pilot project an enhanced programme of support to be offered to a small group of customers with complex needs. This aspect of the pilot service will focus on the most vulnerable families, for example, very young lone mothers, other parents rearing children without the support of a partner and dependent spouses in households with children depending on social welfare payments. It is hoped that the additional support involving individual attention, customised information and enhanced access (an appointment will be set up where possible) to services and supports which would assist the family will enhance the capacity of those in the most difficult family circumstances to improve their personal situations.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the introduction of the pilot project in the autumn are well under way. Regional managers and the project leaders in Cork, Waterford and Finglas are putting in place links with local agencies such as health boards, local authorities, vocational education committees and the voluntary and community groups that work with families in their localities. The latest information technology will be used to support the family services project and to enhance access to information for individuals, families and their communities. Last week, I launched the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; a directory of over 400 local services in Cork which was compiled jointly by my Department and Cork Community Development Institute for the family services project. The directory is an invaluable resource to underpin the service and similar directories are being compiled in Finglas and Waterford. Project leaders are participating in training to equip them with the skills and knowledge to meet the new family service objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family services project will be the subject of ongoing professional evaluation during the pilot phase to assess its effectiveness. The project <Col N="1576" /> draws on the Government's pro-families approach to the development of policies and services for families, the recommendations of the commission on the family, and the strategy statement of my Department which commits the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to promote policies which protect and support families, including the development of service delivery to address the different needs of customers and the creation of stronger links with partner agencies and voluntary organisations at local level.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Commission on the Family, Strengthening Families for Life, was published by the Government in July 1998. The report contains a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the issues affecting families in Ireland and wide-ranging recommendations across several policy areas.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to adopting a families first approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies. In line with this pro-family approach as set out in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government has broadened the remit of my Department to include responsibilities in the areas of family and community and established the family affairs unit in my Department. The unit has responsibilities, <i>inter alia</i>, in relation to the development of a number of family services and a specific function to pursue the findings in the commission's report following their consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>Government priorities for the development of family policy and services over the past two years have brought about significant progress in areas highlighted for action by the commission on the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year significant resources, amounting to some £6.5 million, have been provided for the development of family services in my Department. This compares to £1.5 million in 1997. Major achievements in improved family services include a £2.16 million grant aid programme for marriage and child counselling services and the extension of the programme to include voluntary organisations providing marriage preparation programmes and those providing bereavement counselling and support services. A record number of some 300 groups providing these services have applied for grant funding this year. I expect to be in a position to announce details of the grant allocations within the coming weeks; the framework for the nationwide family mediation service as promised in An Action Programme for <Col N="1577" /> the Millennium is now in place. The service is available from regional centres in Cork, Tralee, Wexford, Athlone, Dundalk and Galway in addition to those in Dublin and Limerick. Services for the north-west and for the western area of Dublin are to come on-stream before the end of the year; by the end of this year some 50 centres will be funded under the family and community services resource centre programme, under which ten centres were being funded at the beginning of 1998.</P>
    <P>A families research programme has been introduced to address the lack of research into the issues and challenges facing families in Ireland today and to help shape the development of family policy and services in the future. More than 30 research proposals seeking funding under the programme have been received and these are currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>A study to explore what would be involved in undertaking a national longitudinal study of children in Ireland will shortly be initiated. This study will be jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Family services projects providing high quality information about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and from the community and voluntary sector, with a particular emphasis on services available locally, are to commence in the autumn. The projects will be piloted by three local offices of my Department &ndash; Cork, Waterford and Finglas in Dublin. It is planned to introduce a parenting awareness programme later this year.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements in support arrangements for pensioners and carers which were prioritised in the programme for Government, together with improvements in the family income supplement and in employment support measures for long-term unemployed people address areas highlighted by the commission in its report.</P>
    <P>The budget improvements for pensioners, including the increases in payment to come into effect this week, will cost an estimated £126 million in a full year &ndash; a further £10 million has been provided to meet the cost of payment of arrears of late claims for old age and widows-widowers contributory pensions. Additional support measures for carers will cost £18 million in a full year. Child benefit increases will come into effect in September. The cost will be some £40.7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are progressing a number of significant policy issues in their own areas of responsibility in line with the Government's pro-families approach. The Minister for Education and Science has a number of initiatives under way in relation to early education, investment at primary level in schools and in tackling educational disadvantage. Progress has been made in relation to the introduction of parental leave and investment in child care projects in disadvantaged communities. The report of the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care has been published and the interdepartmental <Col N="1578" /> committee established by the Government to make recommendations in this regard is expected to complete its work over the summer.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Report of 30 September 1998 my colleagues have set out the initiatives taken within their own areas of responsibility in relation to the report of the commission on the family. In carrying out its responsibilities to co-ordinate family policy developments and to pursue the findings of the commission on the family, the family affairs unit is working closely with other Departments which are affected by the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have taken steps to ensure that the commission's report is discussed widely around the country. Many Deputies will have received invitations to the family services information fora which are being held throughout the country. I, along with the Taoiseach, requested that these fora take place so that discussion could take place on the findings of the commission's report as well as family policy developments in general. The series has been organised by the family affairs unit and seven events have been held around the country to date. The fora provide voluntary and community groups with an opportunity to hear about the new family services and to discuss the issues and concerns which these groups encounter in their work in support of families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance, introduced in 1993, is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. The scheme has proved to be a significant success with over 27,450 persons currently participating in employment and self employment. A further 7,000 are participating on the back-to-work enterprise allowance (formerly known as the area allowance).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important feature of both schemes is that participants are allowed to retain their secondary benefits for the duration of the schemes provided that the combined gross household income is less than £250 per week. This limit has applied since <Col N="1579" /> 1993 and the majority of participants retain entitlement for the duration of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The key secondary benefit affected by the £250 limit is the rent and mortgage interest supplement payable under the supplementary allowance scheme. The retention of the medical card is not affected by the operation of the limit.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the operation of this limit can give rise to disincentive, particularly in the case of persons with families. This issue was highlighted in the recent report published by Goodbody Economic Consultants entitled The Disincentive Effects of Secondary Benefits.</P>
    <P>In line with a commitment in Partnership 2000, my Department recently initiated discussions with the social partners in regard to issues associated with the withdrawal of rent and mortgage interest supplements under supplementary welfare allowance. The £250 limit will be reviewed in that context.</P>
    <P>I am confident that both schemes still remain sufficiently attractive to the majority of long-term unemployed persons to take up employment and self-employment opportunities. Persons with families who take up employment under the scheme may also qualify for family income supplement.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, he will give to paying widow's contributory and non-contributory pensions on a rate comparable to those payable to old age pensioners; the estimated costs involved; and the plans, if any, he has to improve the income for widows dependent on payments from his Department.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s (contributory) pension scheme are more flexible than those applying to the old age and retirement pensions. Widowed people can qualify by using either their own or their late spouse's social insurance record: in addition, a person may also use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
      <P>From June, the weekly rate of the widow(er)'s (contributory) pension &ndash; £82.10 per week for those over 66 and under 80 years of age &ndash; will be 114 per cent of the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. The maximum rate of the old age (contributory) pension &ndash; £89.00 per week &ndash; will stand at 124 per cent of this recommended rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A widow's and widower's non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test. From <Col N="1580" /> June, the maximum rate of both the widow(er)'s non-contributory and the old age (non-contributory) pensions &ndash; £78.50 for those over 66 and under 80 years of age &ndash; will be 109 per cent of the commission's recommended rate.</P>
    <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where appropriate. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows/ widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>In June, the rate of the one parent family payment &ndash; £78.50 for those over 66 &ndash; will also reach 109 per cent of the recommended CSW rate. This payment is available to those widowed people with children, who do not qualify for a contributory widow(er)'s pension. It is available to both men and women who are parenting alone and is designed to, firstly, provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents and, secondly, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence. To this end, an earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
    <P>The pensions board, in its report Securing Retirement Income, recommended that social welfare pensions should be increased in line with prices at a minimum &ndash; and, ideally, in line with earnings &ndash; and that it would be desirable to aim, over a five to 10 year period, to increase social welfare pensions to 34 per cent of average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>The Government has noted the recommendations of the board in this regard. In An Action Programme for the Millennium, we set out our intention to ensure that the contribution made to Irish society by older people would be recognised. In this regard, budget '99 provided for a £6 per week increase in the personal rate of pensions for people over 66 years of age, following the £5 per week increase provided in budget '98. The question of future improvements in social welfare provisions for widows and widowers &ndash; as for all social welfare clients &ndash; and the PRSI financing implications of these is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>The estimated full year costs &ndash; rates effective from June 1999 &ndash; as requested by the Deputy are: £45 million if all social welfare payments to widows-widowers were increased to the corresponding old age pension rates; and £24 million if the increase only applied to those aged 66 or over.</P>

      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and they must satisfy a specified means test. A qualified child is one who falls into one of the age groups specified for the scheme and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of widows and widowers contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple. Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>In 1998, expenditure on back to school clothing and footwear allowance amounted to £10.2 million in respect of 209,300 children. Payments were made to 119,000 children aged between two and 11 years, to 82,900 who were aged between 12 and 17 years and 7,300 who were aged between 18 and 22 years.</P>
      <P>The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from 1 June each year. My Department has requested the boards to ensure that the majority of payments are made by 31 July 1999 to enable parents to make the necessary purchases in the traditional back to school shopping month of August. Based on the experience of health board staff this represents the optimum time for payment of this allowance.</P>
      <P>The health boards have advised that the scheme operated satisfactorily in 1998 with the vast majority of qualified families throughout the country receiving their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>
      <P>As the purpose of the scheme is to assist with the clothing needs of school children in the forthcoming school year, a balance needs to be struck between paying the allowance too early and too late. The present arrangements are satisfactory and I have no plans to advise health boards to make earlier payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme will be reviewed during the course of 1999 as part of my Department's series <Col N="1582" /> of programme expenditure evaluations. The review will take into account the suggestions made by the Deputy and the conclusions reached by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his value for money examination of the administration of the scheme in 1998.</P>
    <P>Any changes recommended in the review of the scheme will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 73 of 21 April 1999, the Green Paper on Voluntary Activity was published in 1997, with a view to initiating a consultation process with the voluntary and community sector leading to publication of a White Paper.</P>
      <P>A steering group has been brought together to advise and assist the Department on a consultation process in relation to the White Paper and to advise on issues and directions for the White Paper. The members of the group have been selected on an individual basis to give of their individual expertise and experience in advising the Department.</P>
      <P>The group's terms of reference are to advise on the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector (and with relevant statutory agencies) in relation to the White Paper; participate in same &ndash; i.e. provide speakers as appropriate; and mediate and comment on feedback and advise on issues and directions for the White Paper.</P>
      <P>It was the intention to publish the White Paper before the end of 1998. However, the steering group expressed concern that the timeframe would not allow for adequate consultation with the voluntary and community sector. They asked that this timeframe be extended so as to ensure that time was available for the widest range of voluntary and community groups to be involved in discussions and debate about the forthcoming White Paper. As my primary concern in the preparation of the White Paper is to ensure that it reflects the issues that are of real importance to the sector and that there is genuine consultation in this regard, I agreed to this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process with the voluntary and community sector provided for a three phased approach. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The final phase will provide for a national seminar to which people, who have <Col N="1583" /> been involved in the initial phases, will be invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their discussion papers.</P>
    <P>The first and second phases of the consultation process have now been completed. In this context, 78 submissions were received by my Department and 56 regional seminars have taken place in different locations around the country. The final phase is now being planned. The steering group are currently developing a number of discussion papers reflecting the issues which have been raised in the first two phases of the consultation process. The national seminar which will be held shortly, will provide the opportunity for people who have been involved in the initial phases to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their papers. Following completion of the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector, it is envisaged that the White Paper will be published later this year.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is payable to eligible participants at the maximum standard rate of unemployment benefit for the duration of the approved course of education. Where a person obtains an undergraduate qualification while in receipt of the back to education allowance and wishes to pursue an add on undergraduate course in the following academic year, he or she will again qualify for the allowance provided he or she continues to satisfy the eligibility requirements.

      <P>In addition to the 57 social welfare local offices which are departmentally staffed, there are 71 branch offices which are managed on a contract basis by branch managers.</P>
      <P>The programme to computerise these branch offices was recently completed. The computerisation of these offices allowed for the introduction of less frequent signing and the abolition of cash payments at these offices. Unemployed persons who sign at branch offices are now in a similar situation to those who sign at social welfare local offices in that they are required to sign once every four weeks and they receive their payment each week at the local post office.</P>
      <P>Computerisation of the branch offices has meant a change in the traditional workload in these offices and in this regard my Department recently reached agreement with the branch managers' association on a revised remuneration package and the introduction of changes in work practice.</P>
      <P>The agreement allows for the introduction of new work into the branch offices. Specifically, the role these offices play in delivering information to customers will be enhanced. In this regard a training programme is being put in place for branch managers and their staff.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also being made for the introduction of the remote certificate entry system in these offices. This facility allows disability benefit recipients to have their medical certificates entered to the system locally instead of posting them to the headquarters section in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The new agreement also requires the branch managers to improve the standard of accommodation they provide where this is deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides the basis for a significant improvement in the level of service at branch offices and will enable these offices to be developed in parallel with the Department's own offices to meet the needs of customers.</P>

      <P>I propose to establish a new agency, to be known as Comhairle, which will be responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services throughout the country. This new agency will combine the National Social Service Board with the disability support service functions of the <Col N="1585" /> National Rehabilitation Board. The necessary legislation is currently being prepared with the Government's approval and I hope to publish this at an early date.</P>
      <P>This move towards a new integrated agency follows a Government decision to replace the NRB with a new national disability authority and to transfer certain functions to a number of existing agencies or Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The improvement of information and support services for people with disabilities was among the key recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The establishment of Comhairle will ensure that services for people with disabilities will become an integral part of an enhanced mainstream information, advice and advocacy service for all citizens, and utilising and building on the resources and expertise of both existing organisations.</P>
      <P>The first board was appointed to Comhairle in November last year. This board will act as the board of the NSSB until the Comhairle legislation puts the new agency on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The board includes five members nominated by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to represent disability interests. This new agency will incorporate the resources of the NSSB and the relevant areas of the NRB and will support the provision of information throughout the country through all channels including the existing network of 85 citizens information centres, more than 400 third party information providers and, as appropriate, facilities currently operated under the aegis of the 18 regional centres.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this new agency will not result in a diminution of services and any further requirements to meet increased demand will be examined at the appropriate time. Details of the proposed relocation of the NRB staff to the receiving agencies, including Comhairle, the National Disability Authority and FÁS, to which NRB staff will transfer, are being finalised at present. Existing accommodation resources of the NRB will be allocated as appropriate to the transfer of responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to carry out an independent appraisal of the concept and full implications of introducing basic income payment to all citizens. The agreement provides that this will be overseen by a broadly-based steering group.</P>
      <P>The steering group is chaired by the Department of The Taoiseach, and comprises representatives of relevant Government Departments and the social partners. My Department is represented on the steering group.</P>
      <P>The steering group has decided to commission the necessary research in two phases: Phase 1, which is largely complete, examines the tax rate needed to fund basic income, and the distributional implications of introducing basic income with this tax rate. Phase 2 is at an early stage; this phase is looking at the dynamic effects of the proposal, including its effects on employment, effects on economic growth, short and long-term budgetary implications and the gender dimensions of all of these. This research will inform any future developments, including the proposed Green Paper on basic income.</P>
      <P>As regards the impact of basic income on fraud, any conclusion is purely speculative at this stage. Since basic income would be an automatic payment, not related to family status, labour market status or income, many potential sources of fraud would simply not exist. Others, such as claiming more than once, would still exist, and might be more difficult to detect. On the tax side, the tax rate needed to fund basic income would require a very substantial increase in marginal tax rates &ndash; this could increase the incentive for fraud in relation to taxation.</P>
      <P>My Department's control policy aims to minimise fraud and abuse by promoting control as an essential element of the day-to-day work of the Department. To meet this objective, the approach to control is aimed at preventing fraud and abuse, such as concurrent working and signing; detecting incorrect payments, fraud and abuse of schemes at the earliest possible stage; and ensuring maximum deterrence. This involves checks and reviews carried out on a regular and targeted basis. My Department devotes considerable resources to the detection of cases which may involve concurrent working and signing. All suspected instances are fully investigated. If there is evidence of abuse, payment is immediately suspended, liability to repay any overpayment is established, recovery attempts initiated and prosecution is pursued where appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board report, Securing Retirement Income, on the national pensions policy initiative published in May 1998 is a comprehensive document and the culmination of a lengthy consultative process.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the proposals in this report was broadly welcomed by this Government, in particular the board's target of increasing secondary pensions coverage to 70 per cent of those at work from under 50 per cent, at present.</P>
      <P>The three working groups which were set up to examine the recommendations in the report continue their work apace. Two of the groups are chaired by the Department of Finance and are, therefore, the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance. One group is examining the issue of part pre-funding of the future cost of social welfare pensions, while the other is examining issues relating to the simplification of the pensions taxation regime.</P>
      <P>The third working group, chaired by my Department, is exploring how best to progress the recommendation to increase occupational pensions coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this &ndash; namely, the personal retirement savings accounts or PRSAs. The Government has accepted this recommendation, in principle, and the working group is making good progress in its examination of the very complex issues involved. The group is currently preparing a consultation document on the technical and operational issues arising in relation to the development of the framework for PRSAs which will issue as soon as possible to a wide range of potential PRSA providers.</P>
      <P>I expect a report from this working group later this year in the context of a comprehensive pensions Bill, which I hope to introduce early next year.</P>
      <P>This Bill will also make provision for a number of other NPPI related matters, namely the pensions board proposals relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation of occupational pensions. In the context of the preparations for this Bill, I will also be considering reports from the board in relation to the treatment of pension scheme surpluses, equal treatment, the establishment of a pensions ombudsman and the introduction of a compensation fund.</P>

      <P>The report prepared by Goodbody economic consultants which I pub<Col N="1588" /> lished in March of this year examines the range of issues associated with the interaction of secondary benefits and the incentive to take up employment and training opportunities.</P>
      <P>The report sets out the background to the evolution of arrangements for the retention of secondary benefits by long-term unemployed people who take up work or who engage in certain labour market programmes. It contains a number of recommendations on how these arrangements might be refined to deal with inconsistencies and anomalies which have arisen.</P>
      <P>Recommendations relating to issues which are outside the remit of my Department, including those related to medical card and the local authority differential rents scheme, are being pursued by the Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>Other wider issues, such as those relating to the question of information provision, will be the considered by the interdepartmental steering group which was established to oversee the study undertaken by Goodbody economic consultants.</P>
      <P>The key issue of direct concern to my Department relates to the rent and mortgage interest supplements paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The Partnership 2000 agreement contains a commitment to consider ways of dealing with the employment trap arising from the withdrawal of these payments once a person takes up full-time work of 30 hours or more per week. Following on the publication of the Goodbody report, my Department has initiated discussions with the social partners on this issue. Two consultative meetings with the social partners have been held and a further meeting will be held tomorrow.</P>
      <P>These discussions are aimed at developing cost-effective solutions to the employment trap identified in the Partnership 2000 agreement which can be considered in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <P>The number of persons claiming family income supplement as at the end of May 1999 was 14,572.</P>
      <P>In order to enhance the value of this scheme and in accordance with a commitment given in the Partnership 2000 agreement, I gave priority attention to reforming the scheme on coming into office. This included raising the relevant income thresholds and making provision for the assessment of income for FIS purposes on a net income basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This change, which was introduced in October 1998, has already had a very positive effect on the number of families qualifying for this supplement. <Col N="1589" /> As indicated, there are now 14,572 FIS recipients, the highest number recorded since the scheme was introduced in 1984. It is envisaged that the numbers in payment will continue to increase in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to take every opportunity to increase awareness of the scheme with a view to increasing the level of take-up. For instance, information on FIS was a key component in the Government's employment action plan, It Pays to Work. Information on FIS is provided on child benefit payable order books and information has been provided by the Revenue Commissioners when they issue tax free allowances certificates. These and other measures ensure that information in relation to the scheme is available in every eligible household in the country. In addition, the scheme is extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers, radio, and the Aertel service, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots.</P>
    <P>From tomorrow, 3 June, as announced in the 1999 budget, FIS income limits will increase by £8 resulting in an average increase of £5 per week for each recipient. This should also further enhance take up of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to the main carers of children and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when <Col N="1590" /> an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment, costing about £475 million per annum including an additional £29 million in the 1998 budget and over £40 million in the 1999 budget. The 1999 investment involves increases in child benefit of £3 per month for the first two children and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children, which will bring the rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46 respectively.</P>
      <P>Child income support policy in recent years has therefore sought to ensure that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents and the approach taken in the 1999 budget is consistent with this policy.</P>
      <P>It would be my intention that this policy direction will continue to be followed in the future.</P>

      <P>A training bonus <Col N="1592" /> of £25 per week for long-term unemployed people on mainstream FÁS training courses was introduced on a pilot basis with effect from 19 April 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bonus is payable to trainees who were on the live register for 12 months or more before commencing training with FÁS. People who progress to such training from community employment are also eligible for the bonus, provided they were on the live register for 12 months or <Col N="1593" /> more immediately prior to commencing community employment.</P>
    <P>The training bonus is part of an integrated package of measures which I have introduced this year to improve opportunities for long-term unemployed people to progress to employment. There is clear evidence that people who participate on mainstream FÁS training courses, which have close links to the labour market, significantly improve their chances of getting a job.</P>
    <P>The bonus is payable in respect of participation on all mainstream FÁS courses and I have no plans to extend it beyond these courses.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland operates a range of schemes to assist inventors bring their products to the market.</P>
      <P>The intellectual property assistance scheme, while primarily aimed at assisting established or high potential start up companies, can provide advice to individual inventors, including those within the third level system, who either intend to set up a business to commercialise their invention or to work with a new or established business to the same end.</P>
      <P>The assistance is focused on the development, commercialisation and funding of patentable technology and, in suitable cases, funding assistance towards the patent programme. For early stage proposals, funding towards patent costs of up to £15,000 may be available. In the case of major patent programmes, up to 50 per cent of the cost of the patent programme, up to £30,000 on average, may be available, subject, in most cases, to a royalty agreement being reached between Enterprise Ireland and the promoter.</P>
      <P>In the case of inventors who are researchers in third level institutions, Enterprise Ireland provides assistance towards commercialising the outputs of their research and development. Funding assistance up to 50 per cent, up to a maximum of £30,000, of the eligible costs, which include market research, prototype development and business planning, may be made available to suitable projects.</P>
      <P>In addition, funding for the manufacture of prototypes, followed by product and process development, may be made available under the feasibility study grants programme, up to £15,000 against eligible expenditure of £30,000 towards the cost of retaining consultants, employees' salaries, prototype sampling and travel and subsistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these schemes provide 100 per cent funding to take something from the conceptual stage to a finished product. It is normal that the <Col N="1594" /> proposer or a private investor, if the proposer has no funds, has sufficient confidence in the project to provide funding. The schemes are designed to supplement such private funding. Obviously the schemes or any private sector investment involves some form of commercial assessment of the proposal before funds can be committed.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, sets out the duties of employers with regard to protecting the safety, health and welfare of their employees at work. In this context it is incumbent upon employers to ensure any work practices, such as bullying, which are detrimental to the safety, health and welfare of employees are not tolerated within the workplace. Employers should ensure that anti-bullying policies, including procedures for dealing with bullying, are put in place. Such policies should be specified in the safety statement which all employers are legally required to prepare under the 1989 Act.</P>
      <P>At my request, the Health and Safety Authority, which is the statutory body responsible for the promotion of occupational health and safety and the enforcement of national legislation in this area, has produced an awareness-raising booklet on the subject of bullying at work. The booklet is available from the Health and Safety Authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2, telephone number 6147000, fax number 6147020. I would suggest that any individual who is being subjected to workplace bullying should obtain a copy of this booklet from the authority, and should also provide the authority with specific details of their own situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 were introduced to enable local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to propose to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources that areas within, or in the seas adjoining, their jurisdiction be designated as unsuitable for the operation of these craft in the interests of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>
      <P>The measures are available for the protection of pleasure craft and their occupants and do not extend to the protection of swimmers, bathers or the natural environment as these matters would be beyond the scope of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources' statutory powers.</P>
      <P>To date, three areas have been designated under the 1992 regulations. These are Lough Carra, County Mayo; Lough Owel, County Westmeath; and Carlingford Harbour, County Louth. A number of other proposals have been received for consideration by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> While the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 were introduced to prevent these craft operating in certain areas the Deputy will be aware, from my previous replies to parliamentary questions, of the difficulties concerning the implementation of these regulations and that the office of the Attorney General has advised that they are now considered to be legally unsound, and do not provide the scope of what most local authorities proposals seek to achieve. As a result, further processing of designation proposals has been suspended by my Department pending the outcome of a review currently being carried out in order to identify the most appropriate and effective means of regulating these crafts with a view to providing for the improvement of safety for all water users.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute, whose functions include the promotion of the sustainable development of the marine leisure resource, have engaged consultants to undertake a full examination of safety in the water leisure sector with a view to proposing models as to how best the safety in the sector can be addressed. The operation of jet skis and fast power craft is being specifically addressed in this examination. The institute and their consultants have been engaging in a full consultation with interested parties, including public authorities and voluntary bodies, and their examination will, amongst other things, involve assessing the most appropriate statutory and non-statutory models, including local authorities input, for management and promotion of the safe use of jet skis and fast power craft.</P>
    <P>As the Marine Institute's examination of the matter will involve assessing the most appropriate local authority input, I am particularly keen to explore further the appropriate role for local authorities in dealing with the problem in their own areas. Indeed, I understand that Fingal County Council has recently brought new beach by-laws into force which will deal with jet skis in certain areas under that council control in accordance with powers under the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Apart from the review being carried out by the Marine Institute, I have initiated additional action to address the wide ranging public concerns that have been expressed in relation to the indiscriminate use of jet skis and fast power boats in certain inland and coastal waters.</P>
    <P>A safety code for jet skis has been introduced by the Marine Safety Working Group which operates under the chairmanship of the director of the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department and whose aim is to create and communicate marine safety information and messages, and to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters. I am arranging to send a copy of the safety code to the Deputy. The purpose of the code is to heighten awareness of the requirements to operate such craft in a safe manner with particular regard to the safety of other water users. The safety code is being distributed widely to safety organisation, <Col N="1597" /> local authorities and people involved in the sector.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that the control of recreational fast power craft must be addressed on a number of fronts. My immediate concern is to ensure that progress is made as a matter of urgency in raising safety awareness amongst the users of such craft. While the use of statutory mechanisms to regulate such craft is proving complex from both the safety and legal perspectives, I am determined that, if statutory measures are identified as being necessary, the various public agencies will agree on a plan of action to implement them.</P>

For this reason, the contract which my Department has with Eurotags for the supply of tags in respect of 1999 provides that a period of up to 15 working days is allowed for the supply of tags. Herdowners were advised in the several notices issued by my Department to order their tags in good time and to allow three weeks for delivery.</P>
      <P>The information available to my Department indicates that in the case referred to, tags were issued by Eurotags on 31 May 1999. The order form submitted in respect of these tags was dated 20 May 1999 and was received in Eurotags on 24 May 1999.</P>

On the basis of the national average yield of 897 gallons per cow this level of quota is equivalent to 11.31LUs. He applied on 154 ewes equivalent to 23.10 LUs under the 1998 ewe premium scheme, each ewe is equivalent to 0.15LU. He also applied for and was paid on four suckler cows equivalent to 4 LUs under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme. No application was received under the 1998 special beef premium scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Waiting list data are collected by health board area, by hospital and by specialty within each hospital. Data are not collected by place of residence. As cardiac surgery is a highly complex procedure, it is carried out in two national centres in Dublin and Cork. Therefore, cardiac surgery waiting lists are held by the eastern and southern health boards.</P>
      <P>The cardiac surgery waiting list at the end of March 1999 was 1,187 which is 42 less than the figure at the end of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of patients awaiting hip and other joint replacement surgery in the North-Western <Col N="1603" /> Health Board at the end of March 1999 was 77. This figure is 50 less than the end of December 1998 figure and represents a very significant decrease is those awaiting joint replacement procedures in the north western area.</P>
    <P>These considerable reductions are the result of a range of initiatives I have undertaken since coming into office in relation to the management of the waiting list initiative. These include an allocation of £20 million to agencies for the treatment of patients on waiting lists; the provision of £9 million to services for older people; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list should be operated.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these initiatives will continue to have a significant positive impact on waiting lists for the remainder of the year, and more importantly that waiting times for public patients will be reduced.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of ambulance services in the Dublin area rests with the Eastern Health Board. The Eastern Health Board ambulance service control centre for the Dublin area provides communications, emergency call taking and activation services from the central command and control centre at Townsend Street, Dublin. In line with similar initiatives in Ireland and internationally, this centre provides control and despatch services for the Dublin Fire Brigade who also provide an emergency ambulance service in the Dublin area. This is in keeping with the Government policy on the matter as set out in the report of the review group on the ambulance service published in 1993.</P>
      <P>The integrated command and control centre helps ensure that the entire ambulance resource for the area operates as a single service. This includes the 11 ambulances operated by Dublin Fire Brigade, providing an emergency ambulance service on a contractual basis to the Eastern Health Board. The operation of a single service is intended to eliminate duplication of services and to improve response times resulting in a more effective and efficient service to those who require it.</P>
      <P>In line with best practice in this area, the Eastern Health Board has contingency arrangements in place to ensure continued operation of the emergency ambulance service command and control centre at the ambulance headquarters in the Phoenix Park available in the event of damage or any other eventuality leading to loss of access to the central control at Townsend Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to paediatric cardiac surgery, where a number of children with congenital heart disease have travelled to the UK for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> The Deputy will be aware that paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Following discussions in 1997 between the hospital and officials from my Department, it was considered that a range of measures should be implemented to alleviate pressure on cardiac surgery services at the hospital. This included the upgrading of the theatre facilities, which when completed will boost the hospital's annual capacity by an additional 100 procedures.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, it was agreed that the hospital should enter negotiations with suitable UK facilities for the purchase of additional cardiac surgery procedures and that resources would be met under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative. Under this initiative 18 children were referred to the UK in 1997 and 30 children were referred to the UK in 1998. Last week, I allocated additional funding of £679,475 to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children under the 1999 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative for the purchase of 35 additional cardiac surgery procedures from the UK, which includes associated transfer, pay and training costs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to note that I have recently granted approval to the hospital to appoint a design team for the theatre development at the hospital. When complete the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. It is expected that when these theatres are fully commissioned Our Lady's Hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures, which is a 40 per cent increase on existing capacity. The estimated completion date for the development is 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that I recently approved the appointment of an additional consultant cardiothoracic surgeon and a consultant cardiologist to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. I understand that the process of appointing suitable persons to these posts is under way and I am confident that these combined measures will greatly enhance paediatric cardiac surgery services.</P>
    <P>In relation to cardiac surgery overall, the Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I announced the development of a national cardiovascular strategy aimed at achieving an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The proposals are built around three key initiatives as follows: the establishment of a national strategy to improve cardiovascular health; the provision of additional public cardiac surgery facilities for adults and children to tackle the backlog of patients awaiting surgery and to guarantee public hospital patients access to cardiac surgery within an average waiting period of six months of being placed on the waiting list; the development of a heart/lung transplant <Col N="1607" /> programme for patients with Cystic Fibrosis and other lung diseases in the medium term.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart lung transplant facility in Ireland. As an interim measure, an agreement has recently been concluded with the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. This agreement is for a two year period and came into effect on 1 April 1999. The agreement provides for a total of 30 transplants to be performed over the next two years, with a minimum of ten transplants to be performed in the first year, subject to the availability of sufficient and suitable organs.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to say that my Department values links with the above mentioned UK cardiac surgery sites and is glad of their continued support in the provision of treatment for patients with very rare and specialised conditions.</P>

      <P>On 20 May 1999 I announced that with effect from 1 July 1999 I will be making Sildenafil, Viagra, available on the general medical services, GMS, scheme and reimbursable under the community drug schemes. The drug will be made available in accordance with the recommendations of the expert group which I established to examine and monitor the prescribing of Sildenafil, Viagra, and to recommend a prescribing protocol and controls which, while ensuring that patients with genuine medical need can obtain the drug, would also protect against possible misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially the group found that erectile dysfunction constitutes a genuine medical condition which, in fairness and equity to those suffering from it, should be treated; Sildenafil, Viagra, is a <Col N="1608" /> safe and effective drug for this condition; it should be allowed to be prescribed by any registered medical practitioner with due regard to accepted prescribing protocols; it should be available on the GMS and reimbursable under the community drug schemes; to ensure availability for genuine need, but to reduce the possibility of inappropriate usage, the group recommended a maximum reimbursable level under the community drugs schemes and GMS availability of four tablets per month. This is consistent with the average number prescribed in the survey carried out by the group, with a recommendation of the drugs and therapeutics bulletin and usage in the clinical trials carried out prior to licensing.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have no plans to downgrade either Letterkenny General Hospital or Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The proposal from the alliance of nursing unions relates to the categorisation of director of nursing-matron posts within five pay bands, which was introduced as part of the 1997 nurses' pay agreement. Both Letterkenny and Sligo general hospitals are classed as band 1 within this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of discussions on the implementation of the report of the commission on nursing, which took place as recommended by the Labour <Col N="1609" /> Court, the alliance of nursing unions sought a restructuring of the bands which would involve including both Letterkenny and Sligo general hospitals in band 2. The management side, represented by the health services employers agency, opposed this proposal.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Labour Court is currently considering claims from the alliance of nursing unions arising from Labour Court Recommendation 16084. The court met both parties on 29 and 30 April last. In view of the complexity of the issues involved, further separate meetings were held with the management side on 20 May 1999 and with the nursing alliance on 25 May 1999. I understand that the Labour Court may arrange a further meeting with the health service employers. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>Beaumont Hospital is the national renal transplantation centre. It also provides renal dialysis services for chronic dialysis patients within its catchment area and it also receives acute referrals from around the country. I have been advised that the service is operated on 24 hour basis from 16 stations within the hospitals and 155 haemodialysis patients and 63 peritoneal dialysis patients are treated on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>This year, in recognition of significant growth in demand for renal dialysis services, I was pleased to be in a position to approve funds of the order of £1 million as part of Beaumont and the Mater Hospital's letters of determination to meet existing service demands for patients in north Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> Over the past year or so, the Mater Hospital has also developed a renal dialysis service for patients in the north Dublin area. My Department is very anxious that the two hospitals would work in close collaboration in the delivery of this service. Following discussions with the two hospitals during 1998, the North Dublin Nephrology network was established. Its aim is to provide a framework for co-operation between the two hospitals in the planning and delivery of the service to ensure a co-ordinated approach to service provision.</P>
    <P>Officials in my Department are in discussion with Beaumont Hospital authorities regarding the future development of their service. In tandem with these discussions, my Department is currently reviewing dialysis service requirements at national level having regard to demographic and epidemiological trends.

      <P>Initial details of the affordable housing scheme were issued to all housing authorities in March last and a comprehensive circular followed on 8 April. The scheme is targeted primarily at major urban centres and their hinterlands where house prices have created an affordability gap for low income house purchasers and where the problem of house price escalation has been most acute, and also at certain other areas where particular factors such as strong demand for holiday homes have increased house prices and created an affordability gap for local people. Local authorities have been requested to assess the extent to which the scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which could be brought to construction at the earliest possible date. To avoid any delay in getting projects off the ground local authorities are not required to submit proposals to my Department for prior approval. Local authorities can meet any expenditure under the affordable housing scheme from their capital allocations for publicly funded housing loans etc. and these allocations will be reviewed in the light of requirements throughout the year.</P>
      <P>While it is very early days yet to see the impact of a scheme which requires the construction of additional housing, I am aware of a range of proposals, some ready to commence construction, in a number of areas. I expect that the target of 400 houses for 1999 will be met.</P>

      <P>Individual road authorities are directly responsible for the provision, maintenance and funding of signposting and roadway markings on non-national roads, through their own resources and-or through discretionary grants made available by my Department. Approximately £23 million has been allocated to county councils in discretionary grants this year, while the discretionary block grant allocation to urban authorities is £13.9 million, including £4.2 million for a programme of footpath and carriageway repairs. Overall this represents an increase of 23 per cent over 1998 in the level of discretionary finance for non-national roads being made available to local authorities. In addition local authority own resource provision for non-national roads in 1999 is estimated at almost £81 million.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the circular letter which issued to all road authorities in August 1998 was to remind them of the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage in the interests of road safety and to ensure that road users receive necessary information clearly and in good time. Accordingly road authorities were requested to carry out a detailed review of signage in their functional areas and to put in place plans to bring signage up to the standards set out in the traffic signs manual as soon as possible. It was not intended that my Department should exercise supervision of this process, but that it should be taken forward through the ongoing and expanding operation of the non-national roads programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> The National Roads Authority, NRA, is responsible for the funding of signposting on the national roads network and, in 1995, the NRA embarked on a major programme of improvement to directional signing and lining throughout the network of national primary roads. Expenditure on the programme up to the end of 1998 is almost £10 million and a further £4 million is being provided this year. At this stage the improvement programme for national primary routes has been completed and work has commenced on national secondary roads, with a view to completion by end 2002.</P>

      <P>These negotiations have not broken down. Following almost two years of negotiations, final management proposals for the new structures were outlined to the staff side at a meeting on the 17 February 1999 and were formally sent in writing to the unions on 26 February 1999. These proposals addressed all of the issues raised by the unions. While there has been some correspondence between the unions and the board since then, the response of the unions to the management proposals is still awaited.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the enforcement of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996. It is a matter <Col N="1615" /> for each authority to put in place arrangements to ensure their effective implementation. I am concerned to see an improved level of compliance with the provisions of the regulations and, to this end, authorities have been regularly urged by my Department to take all steps open to them to secure compliance by landlords with the regulations. In particular, they have been advised that they should have established procedures for prompt and effective follow-up action in relation to any inquiries, complaints or breaches of the regulations. I understand that some authorities are reorganising their inspection arrangements with a view to increased enforcement. For instance, in the case of one major authority, additional staffing resources have been assigned to enforcement duties in a recent initiative aimed at securing greater compliance with the statutory requirements relating to private rented accommodation, including registration. I am keeping the operation of the regulations under review.</P>
      <P>Regarding the number of landlords registered at the end of June 1998 and at the end of 1998, the apparent reduction in the figures is due, mainly, to the fact that the statistical data received from local authorities relating to the end of 1998 excludes landlords where the annual registration fee for their rented dwellings had not been paid up to date.</P>

      <P>There are two social welfare schemes which may assist low income households with heating costs, the national fuel scheme and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Both schemes are income maintenance measures and are not intended to address the particular difficulties faced by those in fuel inefficient dwellings or those experiencing fuel poverty in general. There is no grant scheme operated by my Department for the installation of central heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NFS assists householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. The SWA scheme may assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. A person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a <Col N="1616" /> weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the SWA scheme, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These exceptional needs payments may be made to assist with minor household repairs. There is no automatic or statutory right or entitlement to these payments. They are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. This would include not only the applicant's financial circumstances but also the social, personal and medical needs of the applicant and any adult or child dependants.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of the carer's allowance were considered by the working group who reviewed the allowance to be threefold as follows: to provide income support to full-time carers on low incomes; to maintain people in the community; to recognise and support the valuable role of carers.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was launched in October 1998, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget, at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. The estimated expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is almost £60 million.</P>
      <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to, replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>It was recognised in the review that &ldquo;respite care is one of the most important services required by carers&rdquo; in order to provide the carer with regular breaks and emergency cover. From this month an annual payment of £200 will be made automatically to all carers receiving carer's allowance as a contribution towards respite care to be used as they wish. It is estimated that almost 12,000 carers will benefit from this proposal at an annual cost of over £2.4 million.</P>
      <P>The review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced. This would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. A working group, which is chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, and also comprising membership from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards, has been set up to advance this proposal.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced in the 1999 budget clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers, who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities, and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. In addition, my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required and needs to be developed further.</P>

      <P>Regulations were introduced in November 1997 to provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit and unemployability supplement.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of those regulations, the qualified adult allowance was withdrawn completely once the income of the spouse or partner of the social welfare claimant exceeded £60 per week. Under the new arrangements, however, where the spouse or partner is earning between £60 and £90, a reduced rate qualified adult allowance continues to be payable. In the 1999 budget, provision has been made to extend the upper limit of the income range from £90 to £105, in order to further enhance the incentive for people to avail of employment opportunities.   </P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable varies depending on which category of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the <Col N="1619" /> age of the person and on the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
    <P>Diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, the Southern Health Board has confirmed that the amount of diet supplement in payment to the person concerned is correct in accordance with the means assessed. However, it will contact the person again and explain more fully the means test applied and advise the individual of his right of appeal.</P>

      <P>The issue referred to by the Deputy arises under the qualifying contribution conditions governing the old age (contributory) pension scheme. These require that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age; at least 156 contributions paid or, if the yearly average is between ten and 19, at least 260 paid; and a yearly average of at least ten contributions &ndash; or 24 in the case of a retirement pension &ndash; registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they commenced insurable employment, if later, up to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The contribution year is directly aligned to the tax year &ndash; that is, from 6 April to the following 5 April.

This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as St.</P>
      <P>Vincent de Paul, Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;button&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office in June 1997, the multi-annual budgets for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 for this scheme had been set by the previous Rainbow Government at £2 million in each year. In 1997, I requested the Government to increase this £2 million for that year by £3 million to £5 million and that was agreed. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.</P>
      <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12.6 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. I am in the process of finalising the arrangements for the scheme for 1999 and I hope to be in a position <Col N="1621" /> to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.</P>

Further efforts by my Department to get agreement have been unsuccessful and I will now be urging both sides to use the services of the Labour Relations Commission to resolve the dispute.</P>

      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.

The Education Act, 1998, aims to create more transparency in decisions by schools by providing that they must publish their policy on admission to and participation in the school. The Act provides for the establishment of grievance procedure on a statutory basis within schools under which complaints concerning school enrolment policy may be investigated.

      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, including children with dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support where appropriate of the remedial teacher service. The priority focus of available resources is on the development of in-school services to cater for the children in question. As part of this approach, arrangements are currently being made by my Department to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the Association for Children and <Col N="1628" /> Adults with Learning Disabilities to assist their administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all children with special needs in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. Children with learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are entitled to avail of this development. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the claim of an incidence of 10 per cent to which the Deputy refers. This figure is one of a variety of claims which have been made regarding the incidence of the condition in question,. The Special Education Review Committee, which examined provision in this area, indicated that estimates of the incidence of specific learning disability are usually within the range 1 per cent to 4 per cent, depending on the definition adopted.</P>
