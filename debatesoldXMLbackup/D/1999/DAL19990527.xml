      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4, Companies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and No. 51, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1998 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle and Members, especially the Taoiseach because we know where his heart lies, would wish to congratulate Manchester United on completing the treble last night. It gave great pleasure to Irish people watching it. It certainly allowed traffic to run more smoothly, as I found when I drove home after the vote in the House. There were very few cars on the road because everyone was enjoying the match. We are especially proud that at least two Irish players were in the squad, even if only one was on the team. Denis Irwin played but Roy Keane was not able to play. Nonetheless, it was a great night for both sports fans and those who do not follow sports. I am sure everyone joins in congratulating the team.</P>
      <P>I realise legislation is not promised in this area, but perhaps the Taoiseach could introduce legislation to assist the Irish football team to enjoy again the success they and we enjoyed in the past.</P>
      <P>Within one hour the Taoiseach will meet the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi. Will he tell us exactly what he intends to say to Mr. Prodi about the Irish Commissioner? Would he be in a stronger position in attending the meeting if he had with him the name and qualifications of the person to be nominated so that he could lobby for a portfolio based on that person's experience? The UK already knows who its commissioners will be and will, therefore, have a stronger case to make.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any proposals, possibly under the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, to deal with the issue of embryo freezing and the possible adoption of embryos? It is an issue which is exercising the medical profession at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not covered in that legislation. Assisted human reproduction is not governed by any specific health legislation. Medical practice in the area is governed by guidelines issued by the Irish Medical Council. The proposals for assisted human reproduction raise significant legal and ethical issues. The matter has been under consideration in the Department since it was raised some time ago, and discussions are ongoing with the Attorney General's office with a view to including the issue in a proposed research agenda for the Law Reform Commission. That will be in future. The matter is under discussion but will not be covered in any imminent legislation from the Department of Health and Children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is being drafted. Sections have been brought forward and have <Col N="975" /> been cleared at the various stages of preparation by the Minister. There are about four lots of heads and there are more than 150 heads in the Bill. We have cleared most of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the question again because I am not sure if the Taoiseach answered it. Has the Government cleared the heads of the frequently announced local government Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We saw a miracle last night in injury time. Does the Taoiseach anticipate another miracle in having it published between now and 11 June as was promised yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be published as soon as possible. It will probably be difficult to have it completed and published in that time but it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the heads have not yet been cleared by the Department and bearing in mind the extraordinary capacity of the Attorney General's office to produce legislation, does the Taoiseach seriously say to the House and does he stand over what the Minister, Deputy Dempsey said yesterday on the Pat Kenny programme that the legislation will be published by 11 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Four tranches of this major Bill to modernise local government and implement a range of measures have already been put in place. The final tranche is being completed in the Department and the legislation, as promised, will be published in mid-year. The Bill will involve a raft of major reforms and great credit will be due to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on its introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the promised amendment of the child care legislation, the Taoiseach indicated that the provisions governing inspection would be extended to certain child care institutions. Will he clarify the position in respect of this matter because other Ministers have indicated that such legislation will be forthcoming before the commission the Taoiseach established delivers it report? There appears to be confusion between the Taoiseach's announcement and certain Ministers' interpretation of the position. Will he indicate whether he intends to establish a proper independent inspectorate to oversee matters relating to the various residential child care homes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Given ordinary people's disillusionment with standards in public life, will the Taoiseach explain the delay in publishing the standards in public office Bill? Is this delay due in some small measure to the failure of Government backbenchers to accept the need for tax clearance certificates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked last year by the House to bring those proposals before the committees. They have been considered and dealt with by the committees which completed their deliberations two weeks ago and legislation is now being drafted by the Minister for Finance. There has not been any undue delay other than that caused by the fact that the House had to have an input into the rules which will govern Members' affairs in the future.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For the second time this month I am pleased to bring before this House proposals to amend company law. The Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999, dealing with exempting price stabilisation actions taken in the context of the issue or offer of securities from the insider dealing provisions contained in Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, and certain of the disclosure requirements in Chapter 2 of Part IV of the same Act, passed all Stages in the House on 12 May last. It has since been signed by the President and was commenced earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the present Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill provide for amendments to company law in a number of areas. These are: amendment of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, relating to examinership; amendment of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, and European Communities (Accounts) Regulations, 1993, to provide for the removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain private limited companies and partnerships; additional requirements in company law to tackle the problems created by Irish registered non-resident companies; and amendments to the Companies Acts, 1990, in relation to the timeframe within which summary prosecutions must be initiated, as well as amending section 16 of the Investment Limited Partnership Act, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might help the House if I were to summarise briefly the origins of the legislation in each of these areas. I will then go on to explain in somewhat more detail the content of some of the provisions. The proposals for the refinement of the examinership legislation and the removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain private limited companies arise directly from the report of the company law review group which reported to the then Minister in December 1994, with the report being published in February 1995. At an early stage the decision was taken to implement those recommendations in the report which were considered appropriate, on a phased basis, start<Col N="981" /> ing with those in relation to examinership and removal of the statutory audit requirement. However, for various reasons, the proposals were not progressed to draft legislation until the present Bill was published.</P>
    <P>That is not to say other legislation was not progressed in the company law area, because in the interim, regulations to provide for the uncertificated transfer of securities were made pursuant to section 239 of the Companies Act, 1990. The Irish Take-Over Panel Act, 1997, was also enacted. One European Union directive in the company law area, dealing with the application of the second EU company law directive to subsidiary companies, was transposed into Irish law. Two regulations were promulgated consequential on the establishment of the Irish Stock Exchange Limited as a separate entity from the Irish unit of the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Work on tackling the problems created by Irish registered non-resident companies, which I will refer to shortly, also took up a significant amount of time during this period.</P>
    <P>Turning to the proposals to refine the examinership process, it will be recalled that this process was introduced into Irish company law in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990. The underlying rationale for the examinership process is to assist companies in difficulties to address those difficulties, if possible, rather than have the company put into receivership or liquidation.</P>
    <P>The company law review group, which was representative of a wide range of interests, concluded that the examinership process, which involves the impairment of the rights and interests of creditors, and indeed competitors, of any company which avails of the process, might be justified in the case of ailing but potentially viable companies that have been unable to ensure their survival by voluntary arrangements with their creditors, but where the imposition of a scheme of arrangement might facilitate their survival without undue impairment of the interests of their creditors, their competitors or the commercial environment &ndash; paragraph 2.11 of the report refers. Within the group, and in many of the submissions made to the group, there was the belief that examinership, albeit in a modified form, is a useful mechanism which should be available in Irish company law &ndash; paragraph 2.8 refers.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the group took the view that there should be a greater focus on viable companies and there should be more recognition for the position of creditors. In general, I have accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the company law review group and the Bill will implement most of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>To achieve a better focus on viability, the group recommended that the examinership process should be modified so as to provide that the court should not appoint an examiner to a company unless there is a reasonable prospect of survival of the company or the whole or part of its undertaking. Paragraph (b) of section 5 will now <Col N="982" /> insert such a requirement into section 2 of the Examinership Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>To assist the court assess whether this is the case, the group recommended that a report of an independent accountant should be available when the petition for the appointment of the examiner is made. In this regard, section 7 will in future require the submission of such a report and sets out the matters that must be contained in the report. This is essentially the material that is compiled by an examiner under section 16, but would only be available 21 days after an examiner is appointed. A small number of additional matters have been added to what must be included in the report, for example, paragraph (j) requires details of the extent of the funding likely to be required during the course of the examinership.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that in exceptional circumstances it may not always be possible to have the report of the independent accountant available to accompany a petition for the appointment of an examiner and section 9 contains provisions to cater for this eventuality. In effect, a ten day period will be available during which such a report may be prepared, subject to meeting the specific terms contained in the provision.</P>
    <P>Because of the changed requirements to demonstrate a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; prospect of survival and the preparation of the independent accountant's report, a number of consequential amendments are necessary to the Examinership Act, 1990. These are contained in a number of sections, for example, the amendments in sections 8 and 12 are directly consequential on the introduction of the &ldquo;reasonable prospect of survival&rdquo; requirement, while section 11 makes appropriate provision for the manner of making available copies of the independent accountant's report to the company and other interested parties. Section 14(a) is likewise consequential on the fact that the court will have the independent accountant's report available at the petition stage. It reduces the period of examinership from three months to 70 days, but the possibility for an extension of up to 30 days by the court, contained in section 18(3) of the original Act, will still remain an option.</P>
    <P>In relation to giving more weight to the position of creditors who have to bear the brunt of the pain in an examinership, by virtue of the amendment contained in section 10 of the Bill, they will now have a statutory entitlement to be heard when the petition for the appointment of the examiner is being considered by the court.</P>
    <P>While the expenses of an examiner will continue to be payable in priority to all creditors, secured and unsecured, any liabilities certified by an examiner under section 10 of the original Act will no longer rank in priority to secured creditors. Such certified expenses will continue to have priority over floating and unsecured charge holders. The necessary provisions to effect this change are contained in section 28.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of other changes being made to the examinership process. Section 6 is designed to remove the requirement at <Col N="983" /> present contained in the 1990 Act where any company which is directly or indirectly supervised by the Central Bank can only have an examiner appointed to it if the petition is presented by the Central Bank itself. By virtue of the amendment contained in section 6, this will still remain the case in respect of credit institutions, such as banks, building societies, etc. However, in the case of other companies which are directly or indirectly supervised by the bank, the company or its members, directors or other interested parties, or the Central Bank itself, may individually or collectively present a petition to the court for the appointment of an examiner to such a company.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience with cases which have come before the courts and as recommended by the CLRG, a specific obligation is now being imposed by section 13 on all parties involved in the examinership process when dealing with the courts to disclose all material information to the court and at all times to exercise utmost good faith.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the repeal of section 5(2)(h) of the original Act contained in section 14(b)(ii), banks will no longer be prohibited from exercising their right of set off when an examiner is appointed to a company. This will enable a bank to effectively establish its net position, whether positive or negative, in relation to a particular creditor to whom an examiner is being appointed, and it is this net position that will then obtain as to whether moneys are owed or owing to the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 15 introduces a restriction on what payments can be made during the examinership process in respect of liabilities incurred prior to the presentation of the petition. In future, but subject to the discretion given to the court in subsection (2), such payments can only be made where the independent accountant's report specifically recommends that this be done. The idea is to ensure that all interests, including the court, will be aware of what is proposed and interested creditors who are opposed to such payments will have the opportunity to express their concerns to the court.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 are designed to clarify the law in circumstances where a receiver or provisional liquidator has been appointed to a company which subsequently becomes the subject of a petition for the appointment of an examiner. Section 18 amends the circumstances under section 7(5) of the 1990 Act where an examiner can repudiate a contract. In future, this will be limited to circumstances where the contract is entered into after the examiner is appointed to the company.</P>
    <P>Arising from the repeal of section 17 of the original Act, as the court will now have the independent accountant's report when considering the initial petition, section 21 is designed to set out how the court can deal with matters that come to its attention which would previously <Col N="984" /> have been dealt with under paragraph (d) of section 17. Section 22 makes adjustments to section 18 of the Examinership Act consequential on the fact that the court will already have decided to appoint an examiner. It also adjusts the applicable timeframes and the arrangements that obtain in relation to the provision of the examiner's report to parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 24, in various ways, deal with adjustments in relation to matters to be considered by, and the timing of, meetings of members and creditors to consider an examiner's proposals. In particular, it will no longer be necessary for a class of members to approve the examiner's proposals before they can be confirmed by the court. In circumstances where a company has had to have an examiner appointed, the company law review group was of the view that what was an effective veto on an examiner's proposals by members of the company was no longer considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 25 will put in place more specific provisions as to the manner in which the examinership process handles the position of a guarantor for the debts of a company which goes into examinership. First, it provides that a guarantee can be enforced, but retains the prohibition on this happening during the examinership process. Where a creditor proposes to enforce the guarantee, any rights to vote attaching to the creditor by virtue of the debt must be passed to the guarantor by the creditor. Where a guarantor makes a payment to the creditor, his or her right of recovery under the examiner's scheme of arrangement is also provided for in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 26 contains specific provisions in respect of leases. Specifically, it prohibits an examiner's compromise or scheme of arrangement from containing proposals which would result in a lessor having to accept a reduction in the amount of rent or other payment due in respect of a lease of land after the scheme of arrangement is approved. Similar provisions are made in respect of property other than land where the value of such property is substantial. Guidance is contained in the section which can be used by the court in determining whether a lease will be considered to be substantial.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the provisions in this Part of the Bill. The remaining provisions in this Part to which I did not specifically refer make modifications or adjustments which were recommended by the company law review group or were consequential on other amendments being made.</P>
    <P>In relation to the removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain small private limited companies, contained in Part III of the Bill, this proposal was first recommended by the task force on small business and endorsed by the company law review group. More recently, this proposal has been included in Partnership 2000. It is important to understand that this provision will only be available to certain private limited companies and certain partnerships. The partnerships <Col N="985" /> in question were brought within the requirement to have their accounts drawn up and audited by the European Communities (Accounts) Regulations, 1993 (Statutory Instrument No. 396 of 1993) and are partnerships where all of the members have effective limited liability.</P>
    <P>To avail of the exemption from audit, the company will have to satisfy the specific requirement set out in section 32. I wish to make a number of points in that regard. One is that the exemption will only be available to a company to which the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, applies. The particular relevance of this provision is that a number of companies, particularly guarantee companies, are outside the scope of the 1986 Act and such companies will not be able to avail of the exemption. The exemption will only be available to a company where the turnover does not exceed £100,000. While I appreciate that this figure may seem low, it was recommended by the CLRG. Also, it is worthwhile getting experience of how the exemption operates in practice before considering whether a higher threshold would be desirable. Finally, I draw attention to the fact that the exemption will not be capable of been availed of by a company which does not keep its returns to the Companies Registration Office up to date. This is a most important factor.</P>
    <P>Section 33 contains a mechanism that will enable members of the company to insist on having the accounts audited. It also sets out supplemental requirements in relation to information that must be contained in the balance sheet, which the directors will still be obligated to prepare. Specifically, it must contain an acknowledgement by the directors of their obligations under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, to keep proper books of accounts and to prepare accounts which give a true and fair view.</P>
    <P>Section 34 contains provisions in relation to the manner in which the appointment of the auditor is terminated, consequent on a decision of a company to avail of the exemption. In particular, certain information which the auditor has may have to be brought to the attention of the members of the company. This is another important point. Section 35 obliges the directors of a company to appoint an auditor where an exemption ceases to have effect.</P>
    <P>Section 38 contains the necessary provisions for the manner in which the exemption can be availed of by partnerships which, pursuant to the European Community (Accounts) Regulations, 1993, were brought within the requirement to prepare accounts and have them audited. Such partnerships, which are not very common in this jurisdiction, are made up of partners, all of whom have effective limited liability.</P>
    <P>The proposals in Part IV, while dealing with two specific issues in relation to an amendment to the Investment Limited Partnership Act, 1994 &ndash; in section 40 &ndash; and extending the timeframe within which summary prosecutions under the Companies Acts maybe brought &ndash; section 41 &ndash; also contain the company law part of the package <Col N="986" /> of measures approved by the Government which are designed to address the problems created by Irish registered non-resident &ndash; IRNRs &ndash; companies. It is no exaggeration to say that the problems created by these IRNRs over recent years rank as one of the greatest threats to the reputation of Ireland as a jurisdiction that is well and properly regulated.</P>
    <P>While the number of IRNR companies which have been convicted of engaging in illegal activity abroad may not be that large, the fact that Irish registered companies were embroiled in controversies from locations as far apart as Russia to Mexico and Australia to Israel, as well as a number of instances within the European Union and the UK, meant that the problem was very serious and needed to be tackled. The concept of residency in this context is a taxation concept. However, it is necessary to recognise that even with the changes which have been introduced in the Finance Act this year, the necessity to be able to effectively police and enforce the provisions had to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The basic change made in the Finance Act, 1999, to address the IRNR problem is that, subject to limited exceptions, every Irish registered company will now be tax resident in the State. However, based on past experience, that change alone is likely to prove to be ineffective unless it is capable of being and is rigorously enforced. The main reason for this is that parties who use these companies are prepared to ignore their obligations under both tax law and company law and to challenge the authorities to come after them. For instance, in 1995, an article in an international magazine suggested that parties could ignore requests for information from the Revenue Commissioners on the basis that the chances they would be pursued by Revenue were rather remote.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the provisions in sections 42 to 48, inclusive, cover a variety of aspects of the activities of companies, ranging from the imposition of requirements at the time of incorporation to the introduction of ongoing requirements. Thus, when in future people wish to incorporate a company, under section 42 they will have to show it will conduct or undertake some activity in the State. This is designed to establish a link between the incorporation of the company and the State.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to section 43, for new companies the subscribers will also have to ensure that the company has a person who is resident in the State as a director, while for existing companies a transitional period of 12 months is being allowed before such a requirement becomes mandatory. Alternatively, the section provides that a bond to the value of £20,000 must be maintained by the company. The objective is to ensure that there is a person within the State whom the Revenue authorities and the Companies Registration Office can pursue where a company fails to comply with its obligations under Irish law. In this regard, section 84 of this year's Finance Act introduced changes to the Taxes (Consolidation) Act, <Col N="987" /> 1997, so that the person who is a resident director of a company can be pursued to ensure that the company complies with its taxation obligations. These obligations, in the first instance, would entail the registration of the company for taxation purposes, or satisfying the Revenue authorities that it meets one of the exemptions clauses in the relevant tax provision.</P>
    <P>Section 44 contains supplemental provisions to section 43. It is designed to provide that where a company can show that it has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities being carried on in the State, it can be exempted from the obligations in section 43 to have a resident director, or the alternative of having a bond to the value of £20,000. It will be noted that the Revenue authorities will provide a statement to an applicant and on submission of this to the registrar of companies, a certificate will be given by the registrar effectively exempting the company from the requirements mentioned. There is a strong link between Revenue certification and the decisions of the Registrar of Companies. Provision is made for the withdrawal of such a certificate where information of changed circumstances comes to the attention of the Revenue authorities. This section also contains a definition of what is meant by &ldquo;residency&rdquo; in the context of the new obligation imposed in section 43 to have a director who is resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 45 introduces a limitation on the number of companies of which a person can be a director or shadow director, to a maximum of 25. This is designed to tackle the problem created particularly in the context of IRNRs, where multiple nominee directors appear to be the order of the day. The spectre of a person being a director of many hundreds of companies cannot but bring the company law regime into disrepute. It is said that one individual is the director of in excess of 1,500 companies. Deputies will see that the section contains reasonable grounds for exemption in respect of what might be termed legitimate multi-directorships, and in the case of group situations such multi-directorships will be counted as one. For instance, where there is prior screening of directors, as happens in the case of companies which operate in the regulated sectors, holding of such directorships can be exempted from the prohibition on holding more than 25 directorships. The section contains a mechanism whereby applications can be made in the first instance to the registrar of companies and subsequently in certain instances appeals can be made to the Minister. Finally, the manner in which directorships held when the provision is commenced is dealt with.</P>
    <P>Section 46 inserts a new section 12 into the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982, in relation to striking off companies which fall to make annual returns. In recent years, the compliance rate by companies with the obligation to file their annual returns has been nothing short of abysmal, with only 13 per cent of companies meeting their <Col N="988" /> obligations on time in the year 1997. While many of these companies are undoubtedly IRNRs, it is not solely such companies that are involved. The registrar of companies will now be entitled to move to have a company struck off where it is behind for one year or more with making annual returns. This is a new departure. A number of refinements are made to section 12 to streamline the procedure, including, for instance, allowing the Circuit Court and District Court to handle the applications.</P>
    <P>Section 51 of the Companies Act, 1990, inserted a new section 195 into the Companies Act, 1963. Subsection (8) of the new section 195 permitted a director who had resigned from a company to notify that to the Companies Registration Office. Until then, the company itself was obliged to make the notification. While the obligation remained on the company, the facility was introduced to cater for situations where a company failed to make the notification, and the former director would now, so to speak, be able to correct the public record. However, various difficulties were seen with this provision; most notably, it could result in notifications being made to the CRO such that no director would be on the public record in respect of a company. Section 47 provides for the deletion of the said section 195 (8), and the substitution of a different mechanism to facilitate directors who have resigned to make the notification to the CRO. These are now set out in new subsections 11(a) and 11(b) in section 47.</P>
    <P>Section 48 is tied in to the amendments being made in section 47, and will cater for cases where the records in the CRO show that no person is recorded as being a director of a company. In such circumstances, the Registrar of Companies will be able to move to have this company struck off. I emphasise, however, that by virtue of the detailed procedures in the previous section, the company will have had fair warning that a process had commenced that could result in the records in the CRO not showing any director as being appointed in the company in question.</P>
    <P>I expect to introduce a further provision on Committee Stage in relation to IRNRs and this will be designed to ensure that, where the Revenue authorities find their approaches to a company to get the necessary information to enable them register the company for taxation purposes are ignored or not responded to, they will be able to notify the registrar of companies to this effect. On receipt of such notification, the registrar of companies will be able to write to the company informing it that if it does not comply with its obligations to provide the necessary information to the Revenue Commissioners, he or she will move to strike off the company. Thus, where people ignore their obligations to respond to and supply information to the Revenue authorities, the company may be struck off and dissolved. This is to ensure that where people are prepared to ignore their responsibilities, effective action can be taken against them. This provision was not <Col N="989" /> included in the Bill as published because of the necessity to relate it to the relevant provisions in the Finance Act, which at the time of drafting of the relevant sections in the Companies (Amendment) Bill had not been finally settled.</P>
    <P>In so far as possible, the proposals in company law to tackle the IRNR problem are designed not to have an unduly adverse impact on entrepreneurs who wish to use the company structure to progress their desired projects. Of necessity, some changes may result in a somewhat slower incorporation process, but it is not considered they will add to any significant extent to the cost of incorporation. I intend to ensure the provisions are monitored, and their impact is kept under close review so as that any unintended difficulties which arise for business can be addressed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>That is a summary of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999. I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this debate. I look forward to hearing the contributions of all Deputies, on the Bill's contents because it is of major interest to most Members and to the public. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this legislation is being introduced. Unlike the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, there has been sufficient time between publication of the Bill and Second Stage for Members on this side of the House to consider the legislation. I also thank the Minister of State for the briefing I obtained from his Department. It was most helpful. Bodies outside the House have welcomed the consultation that took place before the legislation was completed by his Department.</P>
      <P>This legislation is only a small part of required changes to company law following the publication of the Company Law Review Group report in December 1994. Most chapters in the report contained a minimum of ten recommended changes. The legislation introduced by the Minister of State last week was not required by the review group, so this Bill is merely the start of the process of change.</P>
      <P>Indeed, given that the report of the review group was published five years ago, changes are probably also required to its recommendations. Despite this, the legislation regrettably incorporates some of them without alteration. I hope, therefore, the Minister of State will be open to the amendments I will put down on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill is broadly welcomed by such bodies as IBEC and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland. The proposed changes to examinership are especially welcome. I will address the provisions regarding examinership, the new auditing requirement and the changes proposed to the Irish registered non-resident companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the examinership procedure has been criticised over the years. The view has been taken that some companies have used it as a shel<Col N="990" /> ter to hide from their responsibilities. Examinership legislation was enacted to give companies running into difficulties a refuge while they could examine matters, redirect their efforts, refinance the company, get more shareholders and do whatever was needed to give the company a chance to be viable and to continue to operate.</P>
    <P>However, there has been a view that some companies have adopted the examinership process to hide from creditors who consequently suffered. An examination of the relevant statistics indicate that many companies did not have the potential to be viable when they went into examinership and they should not, therefore, have used that process. Given this, I welcome the provision that any petition for examinership must be accompanied by an independent accountant's report.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will consider how best to ensure there is a coterie of independent accountants to serve the examinership process. Given the small size of the country, accountancy firms are well known and they operate for many of the companies which may go into examinership. There must be an independent accountancy system so that people can be called on to undertake an examination and to make petitions for examinerships to the courts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the examinership process, I welcome the provision reducing the time for examinership from three months to 70 days. There is no doubt about the genuine concern, especially among American companies, that the legislation covering examinerships is lax. This has been put to me by people involved in company businesses. Overseas investors in what has been referred to as big ticketing leasing have been legally advised that Irish examinership legislation is weighted in favour of the ailing company and against the creditor. This has led to a reluctance by companies to enter the Irish market, especially in view of concerns about the ripple effect on businesses dealing with the large leasing companies, although the concerns expressed in the early 1990s have been ameliorated by the high growth levels in the economy. Given this, the proposed changes to the examinership laws are welcome, even if it has taken approximately five years to introduce them.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides creditors with the opportunity to be heard. However, the legislation covering their rights is not strong enough. They must be invited or make an application to be heard. The section states:</P>
    <P>The court shall not make an order dismissing a petition under section 2 or an order appointing an examiner to a company without having afforded each creditor of the company who has indicated to the court his desire to be heard in the matter an opportunity to be so heard.</P>
    <P>This puts a severe onus on creditors to make sure they know what is happening and to indicate their interest and their desire to be heard. Sometimes it is possible for companies to hide their lack of <Col N="991" /> viability from their creditors. It is important, therefore, that creditors are given the right to be heard. IBEC and other bodies lobbied for this. They also lobbied to ensure that creditors would have a voice in decision making while IBEC lobbied to ensure that the legislation should require two-thirds majority approval before a petition could be brought to the court. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate the thinking behind this omission.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland about the section 15 report requirement. The committee made a submission in May 1995 in response to the CLRG report and also made a submission on the Credit Union Bill, which Deputy Rabbitte brought through the House when he was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment. According to the committee, some of the specified content of the section 15 report is normally not relevant to the forming of an initial assessment as to whether the company involved would have a reasonable prospect of survival. The term &ldquo;reasonable prospect of survival&rdquo; has been incorporated into the Bill.</P>
    <P>The committee also points out that part of the information may take considerable time and effort to determine, which in certain circumstances might mean that by the time the information has been collated and the report presented, the opportunity for examinership will have passed and the company would no longer have a reasonable prospect of survival. If too much information is required and it takes too long to compile the period during which survival is possible will be too short.</P>
    <P>Companies run into difficulties for various reasons. They may have lost part of their overseas markets or they may have to adjust their production to meet the challenges of other competition. It is important, therefore, that the examinership be used judicially to save companies and to ensure the maintenance of jobs. Will the Minister of State examine the reporting framework under section 21 between now and Committee Stage to ensure he is satisfied the concerns expressed by the consultative committee will not be substantiated.</P>
    <P>Small creditors of companies may not have the facility to be involved in the court process. Often large creditors, such as banks and buildings societies, who stand to lose a good deal of money have their eye on the ball, but small creditors who supply a small service or product lose out.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposal to remove the requirement that audits be carried out by small companies, audits are useful in the case of companies that have shareholders, but I am not that convinced they need be carried out by small family owned companies that do not have outside shareholders provided proper books are kept. It is not proposed to remove the requirement that companies carry out audits except under certain very strict circumstances. We all know from our experience <Col N="992" /> the difficulties associated with running a small company.</P>
    <P>The Small Firms Association estimates that small firms must complete 80 core forms annually, which amounts to 5,000 feet of paper in order to comply with all the regulations. It is estimated that dealing with the paperwork and administration involved in complying with all the regulations of the Department and the tax system with which small firms are required to comply, takes half of one full job in a company with only eight employees. A major examination of the administrative blockages and red tape that prevent small firms from being efficient and effective was carried out in the UK. The slogan &ldquo;think small and then grow from there&rdquo; was adopted. The forms small firms were required to complete were examined on the basis of time involved in completing them, the information that had to be gathered and expertise that had to be brought in to complete them. The examination also involved investigating what happened to the forms once they were submitted. Following that examination, 300 forms that small companies were required to complete were discarded.</P>
    <P>We need to carry out a similar audit of the forms used in our system. We need to examine what happens to them when they are submitted to the Department. Are they filed under A, B or C and not looked at again? What is the information on the forms used for? Is it relevant? Does it need to be collected by the Department? If such an audit of those forms was carried out in the Department, I am sure the Minister of State would find that many of the forms are not required. Some of the forms virtually require managers to state what they give their staff for their afternoon tea break and what they had for their breakfast. I hope the Minister of State will examine the number of forms required to be completed. I know some work has been done on that, but it is necessary to examine it with a view to gradually reducing the number of forms required.</P>
    <P>Companies with a turnover that does not exceed £100,000 will be exempt from having to provide audited accounts. The Minister of State took that figure from the company law review group report published five years' ago, but it is unrealistic today. The limit in respect of a company's turnover is £350,000 sterling in Northern Ireland and a similar limit applies in the UK. The Minister with responsibility for commerce in the UK is examining the prospect of increasing the limit of £300,000 sterling or £350,000 sterling to £4 million sterling.</P>
    <P>A small family owned pub with a turnover of £100,000 would yield a profit of 7 per cent. That means the publican would have only £7,000 profit for the service he or she provides and that income would not enable him or her to employ any staff. A business with a turnover of £100,000 would be a small operation and the income derived from it would also be small. That limit in respect of a company's turnover should be increased to a minimum of £250,000 and I recommend that it <Col N="993" /> be increased to the limit that applies in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many companies that operate in Ireland are very small and do not bother with the company registration procedure. Under our tax and other laws all companies are obliged to ensure proper books of accounts are kept. If companies obey that law, that is sufficient to ensure companies are run properly and comply with the law. I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to increase the turnover limit of £100,000.</P>
    <P>A company need not register for VAT purposes if its turnover is less than £700 a week or £40,000 per annum. That figure is unrealistic today. It needs to be examined with a view to raising the turnover ceiling of £40,000 per annum to £100,000 per annum. I am sure all Members have met constituents in their clinics who have raised this matter. I am always amazed when I read about banks and individuals who manage to owe the Revenue Commissioners hundreds of thousands of pounds and, in some instances, millions of pounds. The amount of £1.5 billion was collected under the last tax amnesty. It amazes me how companies can get away with running up their tax bills to that extent.</P>
    <P>People who run small companies have told me that the VAT inspectorate is on their doorstep on the twentieth day of the month asking for their VAT returns, yet large companies manage to get away with not submitting them.  It is a case of the bigger the company, the better it can hide what it is doing, or people are afraid of it. We have heard in the tribunals how the banks said they were afraid of Mr. Haughey. They were afraid to go after him because he was somebody of great importance and they were afraid he might get at them in some other way, yet small companies are constantly being harried in regard to their VAT returns.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister of State's Department is sufficiently engaged with the concerns of small businesses. That was demonstrated by his lifting a turnover limit of £100,000 from a report that is five years' old instead of calculating what that figure would be in today's terms. He has provided that it can be reviewed year in, year out, but he should have set a higher limit.</P>
    <P>Section 42 and later sections deal with proposals in respect of Irish registered non-resident companies. Up to now, Ireland was the only EU state which allowed the registration of companies without tax liabilities being incurred. The change in this year's Finance Act is welcome and these companies will now be subject to taxation. However, as Dermot Quigley was quoted as saying last year, there are about 200,000 non-resident companies registered in Ireland, with £20 billion going through them. In registered Irish companies that figure is £43 billion, so half that amount is going through non-resident accounts. Ireland was gaining a reputation as an offshore money laundering location for people and groups outside this country &ndash; the Mafia and criminals from Eastern Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> I recall visiting Europol headquarters in The Hague when I was Minister for Justice. There was a great deal of discussion about money laundering as Europol has the power to go after those involved. I was appalled when I was taken into a very private room &ndash; the door was locked behind us &ndash; and shown a file. However, it was not a normal file but an enormous map of one money laundering exercise which required a large conference table for its display. The money laundering exercise started in a small bank in a small town in Austria &ndash; I will not say what town as I do not want to give too much information. From that bank there was a series of lines &ndash; it was like an enormous octopus. The map was of Europe and, to my shame, when I looked at Ireland there were 56 lines leading there from the various tentacles stretching across Europe &ndash; 56 lines representing 56 non-resident companies in this country, registered in an office on a street very close to this House. The scale of the map was not big enough to show the 56 companies but they were spread around the coast of Dublin. It frightened me to see how these non-resident companies could be utilised by criminals who knew our laws were lax and that we did not have sufficient powers to examine this companies.</P>
    <P>I have been told that these companies setting up in Ireland were advised not to worry about making returns because the chance of the Revenue Commissioners or the fraud squad catching them was so slight that it was worth the gamble. We should not be proud that people can say Ireland is an offshore location for money laundering and that it is being talked about in the backrooms and haunts of criminals throughout Europe and the rest of the world. I welcome the introduction of the measure whereby a company must be able to show it is carrying on some trading activity in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned about one element of the legislation which provides that all these companies must have a resident Irish director. That sounded fine as a way in which one could have a link with these companies and their directors. However, I am mystified that a bond of £20,000 is the equivalent of having a resident Irish director. Perhaps I am not reading the legislation correctly, but that is how it seems to me. It is an either/or situation, one can have a resident Irish director or one can put up a bond. I do not believe putting up a bond will be much of a problem to people who want to set up a company for criminal activities.</P>
    <P>It is like the argument I made when I was on the council. The council set down a condition where if a company wishing to expand its business or open a new shop did not provide for car parking spaces, a charge of £800 would be levied. I used to tell the council one cannot park on a levy and that it was no good charging one if there was nowhere to park a car, unless the levy was spent on the car parking space. I want the Minister to explain the inclusion of that either/or provision in this legislation. I would have thought it would be <Col N="995" /> better to have a bond as well as a resident Irish director to ensure we have some influence on these companies and that they will not be used for criminal activities.</P>
    <P>We have a reputation as a well regulated financial services centre which we must continue to protect. The minute we lose that reputation, some of the advances we have made in the last number of years will be put at great risk. I hope the changes recommended to registration, where one must have a resident Irish director, will help to ensure the Mafia and criminals from all over the world do not see Ireland as a place to practise their dubious activities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions in the legislation which I welcome. Section 46 allows for companies to be struck off if they have not filed annual returns after a year. There is already a law which provides that companies should be struck off if they have not filed annual returns after two years. However, we all know the Companies Registration Office was not working effectively and efficiently. It is thanks to the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, that the Companies Registration Office can now boast it is doing the job it was set up to do. A new computer system has been installed. It is frightening that, as the Minister said, only 30 per cent of companies made their annual returns on time.</P>

      <P>That is even worse. I welcome that the CRO now has the facilities to clean up its act and its books and that many companies have been struck off. All the people who have jobs in the current economy owe them to the policies adopted over the years by various Governments &ndash; our education policy and our desire to ensure we live within our means. However, if we allow our company law to fall into disrepute and do not keep it up to date &ndash; this is why this Bill is welcome although a great deal more work needs to done &ndash; we will lose the benefits we have gained because we will acquire a bad reputation. Good companies wishing to set up here will be concerned about bad practice. I welcome this Bill. I will put down amendments on Committee Stage but I hope it will pass Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to give a broad welcome to this Bill. One could not foresee the day when the company law code would be regarded as sexy material in political terms because it is a complex area requiring a great deal of expertise on the part of people who both operate and implement the law, especially as regards those who try to keep the company law code up to date, making changes and bringing forward amending legislation, which this Bill is. One only has to look at the background and the fact that the Tánaiste has 13 different inquiries under way at the moment to appreciate how relevant and <Col N="996" /> urgent this kind of amending legislation is. The business environment changes and business practices evolve. There is a necessity to bring the law up to date and to keep abreast of these developments. The fact that the Tánaiste has established 13 different inquiries into the behaviour of many companies and company executives points to this.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste said in high profile statements that she possesses shocking information relating to breaches of the company law code, suspected tax evasion and other offences related to the conduct of company directors, owners and shareholders who considered themselves to be above the law. That is a serious indictment of sections of corporate Ireland. It is a cause of puzzlement for those who follow these issues that, six months after the Tánaiste started making such statements, we still do not know what she is talking about.</P>
      <P>She recently started to circumscribe her statements by implying that she might have great difficulty in passing this information into the public domain. That is entirely contrary to the impression she has given for some time. If she has discovered that, under the sections of the Companies Act which she has invoked to cause the inquiries to be held in the first place, she is now prevented by law from publishing them, it was extraordinary that she gave a number of high profile interviews on how she was going to clean up corporate Ireland and how, to use her famous phrase, the public has a right to know.</P>
      <P>She said that she is in possession of this information and it is clear that it seriously oppresses her, yet she cannot share it with the House. It is time for the Tánaiste to come clean and tell us what she intends to do. There is a great deal of concern about this. I do not think the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, not to mention Tánaiste, can make such statements and then resile from them or relax in the knowledge that she will be long out of office before the reports come through and that they will never be published. Speaking as someone who supports the Tánaiste's institution of the inquiries, that is not acceptable. She was courageous to institute the inquiries at the time. It represented positive political action and concern about the culture of a certain section of corporate Ireland, its ethics, its duties under company law code and the law generally, its approach to compliance and its relationship with the State, politics and political parties. I ask the Tánaiste to tell us, six months after she started these interviews, what we ought to know and what remedies are needed to address these factors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the report of the company law review group, which the Minister rightly says is <Col N="997" /> the basis of this Bill, or at least the sections of it other than those which deal with Irish registered non-national companies, it is a matter of where you stand on the usefulness of examinership in the company law code. We all agree it is a useful mechanism. The question of the rigour of the test applied arises then in terms of the practicality of examinership.</P>
    <P>Examinership was born in extraordinary circumstances when the Dáil was reconvened in August 1990, when the Goodman group of companies was threatened with extinction. Something equivalent to examinership exists in many other jurisdictions &ndash; it is called Chapter 11 in the United States. Corporate rescue is a concept well known in company law.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister comment on whether he has looked at the circumstances where a company can abuse the concept or appear before the courts to seek the appointment of an examiner because of reckless adventurism on the part of that company. Companies get into trouble for various reasons. There is no justifiable reason a company enduring temporary problems, which can trade out of those problems, should be able to resort to examinership to give a period of respite when it can get the show back on the road.</P>
    <P>It could be said that all those features of adventurism and reckless trading were present in the Goodman group, yet we decided in this House, for the overriding reasons of the importance of the group of companies in the agricultural sector in terms of employment and the potential destabilising effect on the agricultural market, and notwithstanding the reckless trading on the London Stock Exchange, widespread tax evasion and other matters, that we would proceed with the examinership. We did that by agreement, albeit in an environment of serious criticism in this House in August 1990. The Minister did not, in an otherwise comprehensive script, advert to the possible abuse of resort to examinership and I would like to hear his views on that issue.</P>
    <P>The point concerning examinership relates to the test to be applied. The courts have interpreted the Act of 1990 to mean that if a company has some prospect of survival, an examiner may be appointed. The company law review group report, in considering that, decided that the test ought to be changed to a reasonable prospect of survival. In the circumstances that is right. When one considers that the concept of examinership is an impairment of the rights of other people &ndash; creditors and competitors &ndash; surely it is right that there should be a reasonable prospect of survival. If all professional expertise and assessment concludes that the company will fail anyway, what is the merit of examinership?</P>
    <P>Therefore, the application of the test of a reasonable prospect of survival is correct. I support the recommendation of the Company Law Review Group to have a report submitted at the time of the petition from an independent accountant. That is correct and fair. I do not know whether the Minister will say that will result <Col N="998" /> in an additional cost to the examinership process. The examinership process can be expensive. That is not a big factor in the scale of a significant company but it might be a factor in the case of a smaller company. I do not know whether the requirement to introduce an independent accountant to do the kind of report which is envisaged to accompany the petition for examinership is envisaged as resulting in a significant increase in the cost associated with examinership.</P>
    <P>This is a complex area which is not entirely value free. It is in danger of suffering from incestuous comment from people who have a vested interest and it involves a question of the public good. I am not just talking about examinership, I am talking generally about amendments to the company law code. On another occasion I set down my guiding philosophy. I said that the company law code is a crucially important aspect of the structure of the modern state. The rights of incorporation and limited liability are important for the proper functioning of the modern economy. However these are rights granted, or licensed as it were, by the State. The limited liability company is an artificial construct. With the rights of incorporation and limited liability go duties for those who avail of the licence &ndash; and also the State itself. If incorporation and limited liability are to work effectively, companies and their directors and managements must comply with the code and the State must efficiently and readily ensure its proper and transparent working and full compliance with the code. It is this latter aspect &ndash; the delivery by the State of an efficient, cost-effective register of companies and associated information &ndash; that lies behind the programme of investment and reorganisation, to which Deputy Owen referred, which I made in the future of the CRO. However I also stress that companies, their managements and directors also have duties. These include, in the context of the CRO, the duty to file returns on time. In this regard it has to be said that the record of the corporate sector has been, to use the Minister's term, abysmal. Compliance is crucially important precisely because the limited liability company is so central to economic life. The company is not simply its members or shareholders. Customers, creditors, staff, bankers and the wider community can all be considered stakeholders in the enterprise and all have, to my mind, certain rights to information &ndash; even the basic and limited information that is required to be filed at the CRO.</P>
    <P>That is a statement of the balancing rights. That there are significant privileges and benefits conferred as a result of incorporation, limited liability, etc., means that there are duties and obligations on the part of the people running those enterprises and companies to the companies' stakeholders, who include the workers and a wider concept of consumers.</P>
    <P>The record is not great, to put it mildly. Deputy Owen referred to the shambles which was the <Col N="999" /> Companies Registration Office. I do not mean that in terms of the performance of the workforce, who were functioning in impossible circumstances, trying to do a job which simply could not be done with the investment, technology and space which was afforded to them. It is remarkable that they managed to do what they did, given the circumstances in which they had to work. The office has been a shambles for a long time and , as Deputy Owen commented, it is extraordinary that the Minister comes in here to say that last year there was 13 per cent compliance with the obligation to file annual returns, presumably within the required timescale. I am not blaming the Minister or the CRO for that because it must have taken it some considerable time to bring its systems and work up to date following the mess in which it was left over the years. As Minister, I provided for major investment in IT. In addition, we purchased and opened a new premises, Commerce House, Parnell Square. It houses, among other things, the CRO and the modern facilities are more in keeping with what one would expect. The shambles of the CRO illustrates the phenomenon about which I have been talking, the decades of neglect ending in the officers simply not being able to function and being swamped in a backlog of work bereft of resources.</P>
    <P>That could not have happened without the State administratively and politically turning a blind eye over the years. The nod and wink political culture, which has obtained in Ireland and which is being swept away in many cases, was part of that. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, is an especially adroit proponent of the nod and wink culture but, nonetheless, he acknowledges that the situation must change if commerce is to perform efficiently in Ireland. The CRO, as it stands and following the enactment of the Bill, will be a significant resource for business and for compliance in this environment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to refer to the points raised by Deputy Owen about big-ticket leasing because I want to hear his views on the point lobbied for by some sections of business in respect of examinership and big-ticket leasing. The view I put on the record in the past remains my view and I want to hear what the Minister has to say about it in 1999. I said then:</P>
    <P>The general scheme that I have approved to be brought to Government does not reflect the recommendations of the CLRG in respect of set-off and big-ticket leasing. The CLRG recommended that banks and big-ticket leasing companies be allowed the right of set-off or netting as it is otherwise known.</P>
    <P>I thought long and hard about this issue and in the end, decided that the public good was better served by leaving unchanged the law of Examinership &ndash; as it relates to this issue. In this I have been influenced and guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in the <Col N="1000" /> Kentz/Holidair case and also the decision of McCarthy J in the case of Atlantic Magnetics.</P>
    <P>This decision will clearly prove controversial. Therefore provision has been made to explore, during the preparation of the Bill, other mechanisms that might accommodate the concerns of the big-ticket leasing companies.</P>
    <P>During my time in office, some sections of business expressed the view that this was a particularly important dimension for them. I was not persuaded for the reasons I have outlined but I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the minority report submitted to the company law review group at the end of 1994? I refer particularly to the Sweeney minority report which recommended that employees' wages, salaries and holiday pay should be specified in every funding statement as pre-petitioned debts . That provision is not, to my knowledge, included in the Bill. The argument seemed to be a reasonable one as workers also have certain rights in these circumstances. If I am correct in concluding that the Minister has not included this measure in the Bill, I would like him to outline the reasons for that.</P>
    <P>I take no great issue with the provisions on examinership. It is a useful mechanism and the change in terms of the test from a company having some prospect of survival to having a reasonable prospect of survival is reasonable in the circumstances. The Minister stated in his speech that he has accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the company law review group and that the Bill will implement most of its recommendations. Perhaps he will remind me which of the more serious recommendations have not been included and indicate the reasons for that.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that section 6 is designed to remove the requirement currently contained in the 1990 Act whereby any company which is directly or indirectly supervised by the Central Bank can only have an examiner appointed to it if the petition is presented by the bank itself. Does the Minister envisage any difficulties arising there in the context of the examination which is currently ongoing, which we are told is likely to recommend the creation of an independent financial regulator? It is very difficult to know from the dispute which has occurred within the McDowell committee which way this will go. The committee appears to be quite seriously divided between the nominees of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the one hand and the Department of Finance and the Central Bank on the other. I do not know which view has won out in the McDowell report. When I put the question to the Taoiseach this morning, he confirmed that the McDowell report is currently with the Tánaiste. Is it likely that we will enact a section here which will be out of date in a few weeks' time or is the <Col N="1001" /> Government equally divided on the report? I would imagine that is extremely likely as I cannot see the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach going along with the thrust of the McDowell report in terms of a financial regulator being appointed in a green field situation, separate and independent from the Central Bank. I would like to know what the situation is.</P>
      <P>I am not greatly motivated in regard to the removal of statutory audit requirements as they relate to certain small companies in certain strict circumstances. Indeed, I am quite inclined to support the measure as this is not a major issue. A statutory audit can be a good thing in most circumstances, not least from the point of view of imposing a discipline on a small company which it might not otherwise have. As Deputy Owen stated, provided good books are kept, this may contribute somewhat to reducing the level of bureaucracy which exists in respect of these small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The audits cost in the region of £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an insignificant factor for small or micro enterprises. I wonder what thought has been given to the point raised by Deputy Owen about the £100,000 limit recommended in the five year old company law review group report. A sum of £100,000, not necessarily for reasons of inflation but also for other reasons, is not now regarded as a huge amount of money. If one was in the house building business, it would not get one very far. If we are convinced it is desirable to exempt certain small companies in certain strict circumstances from statutory audit, one wonders whether the £100,000 ceiling has any great relevance in Ireland in 1999. I understand the point the Minister made to the effect that he would like to let matters run for a while to ascertain what the implications might be, but some increase in the figure would be desirable if it is to have any great meaning.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the phenomenon of Irish registered non-national companies. I hope we will have time on Committee Stage to tease out measures in this regard. I was not aware that this was a scandal of the dimensions adverted to by Deputy Owen until I left office. The omission may be partly my fault as the Department had a very heavy legislative schedule at the time. It has been very difficult to get any Minister to outline the precise scale of the problem, but if it is of the scale outlined by Deputy Owen, we should, in the interest of Ireland's reputation as a trading nation, clean up matters. I put forward certain proposals in the context of a previous Finance Act in regard to imposing additional duties on company formation agents which would allow us to track the conduct of these companies. I would like to return to that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem was probably fuelled by measures taken in Britain in relatively recent times. When Britain tightened up measures, these <Col N="1002" /> companies fled across the channel to Ireland. As a result, the problem has worsened dramatically in recent years. Perhaps that makes it all the more urgent that we deal with the matter now. These companies have no regard to compliance with the measures which have been introduced in this year's Finance Act &ndash; the Minister stated as much in his speech. They will simply ignore them on the basis of the arithmetical risk that they will get away with it. Far more onerous requirements must be enshrined in the law and the power to strike off and dissolve companies, which is ultimately provided for in the Bill, is welcome. As Deputy Owen said, we should have an opportunity to debate this measure in more detail on Committee Stage, hopefully after the Minister of State's elevation to Europe &ndash; not that I do not appreciate his company. I hope he will be still with us but I do not know in what capacity. I ask that Committee Stage not be taken next week. I am sure the Minister of State has a busy schedule &ndash; there is much travelling to be done &ndash; but I hope he gives us an opportunity to deal with this matter on Committee Stage in a more leisurely atmosphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, relating to examinerships, the removal of a statutory audit requirement for certain private limited companies and partnerships and to introduce provisions to tackle the problems created by Irish registered non-resident companies. They are the principal matters being covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>The concept of examinership was introduced in this House in 1990. As part of this debate I would like people to review the position since 1990 to try to establish the number of companies which have used this facility successfully. The only information I could get in this regard was from the Company Law Review Group report published in December 1994. That report contains a table covering the first four years of the operation of examinerships, and some of the figures make interesting reading. One schedule appears in the report but there is a caveat in relation to the information in it which is based solely on the returns to the Companies Registration Office. One could be under the impression that it represents only 13 per cent of examinerships because that is the figure we have been given on compliance by companies making annual returns. I have no idea whether the registration of examinership details with the Companies Registration Office is any higher or lower; all we can do is deal with the figures that have been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the four years from 1990 to 1994, 166 companies applied for examinership. An examiner was appointed in 138 companies. in other words, 83 per cent of the companies which applied to the courts for examinership were successful in having an examiner appointed. Of those 138 companies, 91, or two-thirds, devised a scheme of arrangement for the future viability of the company. <Col N="1003" /> Forty five of the companies, or one-third, to which an examiner was appointed were unsuccessful. Of the 91 companies which put in place a scheme of arrangement, there was an 88 per cent success rate in terms of their survival. These companies have served a useful purpose. I am surprised that the numbers were so low over a four year period. The Department informed me this morning of the figures for the subsequent four years. There were only 36 applications for examinerships between 1995 and 1998.</P>
    <P>This facility is totally under-utilised. I am aware there have been some high profile cases over the past nine years, but I am surprised that the numbers are so low. If companies are experiencing difficulties in terms of creditors, banking institutions and the Revenue Commissioners, they might consider using the examinership procedure rather than opting for receivership or liquidation, a more common feature in Irish society. I would like to see the facility developed further.</P>
    <P>Another document I examined before coming in to speak in the debate was produced by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland which comprises the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Association of Certified Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland. They have studied the proposed legislation in detail and I understand they have made important submissions to the Minister in the course of the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Much of the Bill is taken directly from the conclusions and recommendations of the Company Law Review Group report which contains approximately six or seven chapters. The recommendations in respect of two or three of the chapters are incorporated in this legislation. I welcome the fact that the legislation substantially reflects the recommendations and conclusions in relation to those areas on which the Company Law Review Group reported.</P>
    <P>The key changes in relation to examinership include amending the Companies Act, requiring the court to be satisfied before it appoints an examiner that there is a reasonable prospect of survival of the company in whole or in part. That is important because part of a company may be viable while another part may not and the court must be satisfied there is a reasonable prospect of a section of a company continuing in the long-term before it appoints an examiner.</P>
    <P>Another major feature in the legislation is that until now, a company would ask a court to appoint an examiner, the examiner had to return in 21 days with a report to the court, and the examinership lasted in total for approximately 90 days or three months. That position has now changed. Before the examiner is appointed, he or she must first come forward with an independent report from an accountant. That has had a knock-on effect on the period covered by the examinership. Under existing legislation, the first 21 <Col N="1004" /> days of an examinership are used to compile a report on the future viability of the company. That would be done in advance, although I stress there is no timescale in that regard. A company might be in a position to compile a report in days or it could take several weeks. That is a matter for the company even before it approaches the court. The examinership period will be much shorter than heretofore because of the production of those reports at the outset.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of an independent accountant, the legislation states that it should be someone who is capable of being appointed a liquidator. Obviously that would be a professionally qualified accountant from one of the recognised institutes of accountancy, but it also provides that the company auditor, who had been precluded from being an examiner because a liquidation sometimes follows an examinership, may be appointed as the independent accountant. The auditor, however, cannot be appointed as the examiner because there is a restriction on an examiner acting as an auditor. The company auditor is probably the best person to produce a report to the court in the first instance. That will speed up the entire process. I have some reservation&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be a concern that the auditor could be seen as having a vested interest in producing a good report to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of one of the accountancy bodies I cannot agree with the Deputy's imputation in respect of the character of some accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing that. I am simply saying it might be alleged that somebody was not quite independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the legislation specifically deals with that point. It states that the court must be satisfied that the accountant is acting in the utmost good faith and discloses all facts material to the exercise of the court's decision. I welcome that provision because the Deputy's point is a legitimate one and it should be covered in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have been concerned that this practice may have been abused in the past. Based on the number of companies which have gone through this procedure, it appears it has been under-utilised but I am concerned that, until now, a company could go to court, have an examiner appointed and then produce a report from the examiner in 21 days. They now have to go to court with the report. I am concerned that if the management or shareholders of a company feel there is a need to examine the question of drawing up an independent report with a view to having an examiner appointed, that information could be leaked by employees, creditors, banks and other financial institutions. If an auditor asks a bank to verify loan and repayment schedules <Col N="1005" /> outside the normal course of audit work, the bank would know from the operation of the company's accounts that there were difficulties and there would be a temptation for some companies to appoint a receiver immediately, before the independent accountant produced his report. I am concerned that this issue is not dealt with. Under this legislation an examiner or a liquidator could be appointed while the report is being completed. The independent accountant and the company could go to court and state they need an additional ten days as they were unable to complete the independent report due to circumstances beyond their control. The fact that a receiver was examined could be used by the company as a reason for the judge awarding it ten days' breathing space to allow it finalise its report.</P>
    <P>The accountancy bodies have asked for clarification as to whether the ten day period refers to working days or includes Saturdays and Sundays. They have also stated that ten working days is a little restrictive and that the court should be able to extend the period by a limited number of extra working days in exceptional circumstances. The court has no such facility under this legislation. Some flexibility should be introduced at that stage of the procedure.</P>
    <P>In their presentations to some Members, the accountancy bodies also made a small but practical suggestion. At present when a company is under examinership, every document &ndash; bill, invoice, letter &ndash; which is sent out must bear a stamp stating &ldquo;under the protection of the court&rdquo;. Most people would be worried if they saw this stamp on a document from a company with which they were dealing. The words should be changed to something like &ldquo;under examination&rdquo; or &ldquo;under examinership&rdquo;. We can argue about the wording, but we should use words like &ldquo;in receivership&rdquo; or such terms with which people are more familiar. The current wording is a little heavy-handed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the information to be provided as part of the independent auditor's report. I am pleased the independent report must state whether deficiencies between the assets and liabilities of the company have been satisfactorily accounted for. This is a welcome provision because if there has been fraud and the accountant has not been able to satisfactorily account for the deficiency that should be stated. I hope a judge would use such information as grounds for not granting an examinership.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the issue of the survival of all or part of a company. The legislation, however, does not propose action in cases where there is evidence that assets have been removed. If the independent accountant finds <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fraud it should be referred immediately to the Garda Síochána. The Bill makes no mention of what should happen to such information. There should be a follow through as there is no point in highlighting such an issue if nothing is done about it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other important sections in the Bill. The creditor will have the right to go <Col N="1006" /> to court. Deputy Owen stated that small creditors may not have the resources to take a case, but the right exists and perhaps this could be spelt out in more detail on Committee Stage. The period of the examinership has been shortened considerably. This will bring a sharper focus to the procedure and people will be more willing to avail of the facility for proper uses. In the past it was sometimes used for the wrong purposes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reference to the viability of a company. If a company is not viable there is no point in going through the exercise of examinership. If a company is going down the tubes, the sooner that reality is faced up to the better for staff, creditors and others owed money. If we do not do so we are only prolonging the agony and adding to the company's deficit, leaving less funds for those owed money. The court should refuse the application for examinership if there is not a reasonable prospect of viability.</P>
    <P>I have already queried the qualifications necessary for the independent auditor. In his funding statement to the court, the independent auditor can list the payments which should be honoured. Knowing some of those in the accountancy bodies, their fees for producing the report are the first payments they will list. If possible, however, the report should also list payments to staff as a priority.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a section dealing with audits of small companies. The legislation is correct in stating that the requirement should be removed in certain circumstances, primarily when turnover is £100,000 or less, or when companies are part of a larger group. Overall consolidated accounts might not be accurate if an individual small ancillary was not properly audited.</P>
    <P>The provision that shareholders holding 10 per cent of the shares have the right to insist on an audit is also important for small companies. I agree the figure of £100,000 is unrealistic. For a retail business operating on a margin of 10 per cent or 7 per cent, a gross margin of £10,000 on a turnover of £100,000 is a very small amount on which to run premises. Such an amount would not even equate to a social welfare payment. The figure in Northern Ireland is £350,000. If the Minister of State does not agree to increase the figure to a more realistic amount, he should include a mechanism to review it in two or three years. The figure of £100,000 is far too small. We know the problems filling out forms create for small companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill has some excellent provisions for Irish registered non-resident companies. There is the issue of a £20,000 bond . However, this figure is a joke if companies operate on the scale suggested by Deputy Owen. Will the Minister of State address the requirement that a director must be resident in the country? Does this mean the director must live or be resident here for tax purposes? If the latter is the case, the person may not have to be living in the country. Is the resi<Col N="1007" /> dency requirement a reality or a virtual reality in terms of the tax code?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit like a hologram.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. There is only 13 per cent compliance with practice in the Companies Registration Office. As a general principle, Members of the House should ensure that the laws passed years ago are enforced. Clearly, the law is not being enforced if there is 87 per cent non-compliance.</P>
      <P>Rather than introduce various amendments to company law, existing company law should be enforced. In that regard, I urge that an annual report from the Companies Registration Office be laid before the Oireachtas, if that does not already happen. If those figures had been put before the House annually, Members would have been well aware of the problem before now and would not have been obliged to carry out this fire brigade exercise. I make that call in a positive manner to ensure that this matter is properly dealt with in the future.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their interesting contributions. As I explained earlier, this Bill will bring about changes in a number of areas of company law. Parts II and III deal respectively with amendment of the examinership process and removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain private limited companies and partnerships. They arise directly from recommendations made by the company law review group. The provisions in Part IV of the Bill regarding Irish registered non-resident companies are the result of a detailed examination of the problems created for the State by the phenomenon we now refer to as IRNRs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of specific issues in their contributions and I will attempt to deal with them. Of course, Deputies can discuss them in more detail on Committee Stage when I will be happy to explain what the legislation is designed to achieve. Deputy Owen referred to the refinements that are necessary to the company law review group recommendations. The McDowell committee on company law compliance and enforcement has made recommendations regarding investigations and restriction or disqualification of directors. That report was recently published by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. It makes far-reaching recommendations for changes in company law, including the establishment of a new office of director of corporate enforcement and the establishment of the company law review group on a statutory basis. Specific recommendations for changes in company law are also included. The Government recently approved the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the working <Col N="1008" /> group. This will be treated as a priority and will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen pointed out that big-ticket leasing was adversely affected by our examinership legislation. The changes in sections 18 and 28 will address these concerns. She also asked that creditors' rights be protected to a greater degree. Section 10 is drafted to provide that the process cannot be delayed by creditors failing to signify their position to the courts as, if it is difficult to track them down, the process might be unduly delayed.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy Owen was that small creditors are not protected. Section 24(4) of the 1990 Act requires the court to be satisfied that the proposals are not unfairly prejudicial to any party. She also said that 50,000 foolscap pages had to be completed by companies in Ireland. The task force on small business did not identify company law as an area which imposed undue burdens. Only one annual return to the Companies Registration Office is required, but I accept the Deputy's general point that all burdens imposed by the law should be reduced. I agree it would be wonderful to rationalise, standardise and synchronise documentation and thereby reduce it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Owen, Rabbitte and Fleming said the £100,000 turnover level is too low. While this figure might seem low, it is a reasonable first step. We cannot open the doors immediately, we must do so carefully. It would be useful to gain some experience of how this threshold operates and how many companies avail of this exemption before considering increasing it. However, there should be a facility in the legislation whereby this can be changed when it is deemed appropriate, whether that is after three, six or 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is five years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Deputy Owen also asked that the figure for VAT be raised from £40,000 per annum to £100,000. This is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I am sure the Deputy will give him good reason to consider it. She also referred to the problems created by Irish registered non-resident companies and she, Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Fleming sought an indication of the number of companies which might fall into the IRNR category. This issue has been raised on numerous occasions. It is not possible, for reasons I will outline, to be definitive as to the number of companies which might fall into this category. This arises from the fact that resi<Col N="1009" /> dency in this context is essentially a taxation rather than a company law concept. In the debate on the Finance Bill last year, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, suggested that the perception that there might be up to 40,000 of these IRNRs probably had its origin in articles which appeared in the British journal &ldquo;Taxation&rdquo; or in &ldquo;Tax Planning International Review&rdquo;. These articles were, apparently, written by a Dr. Michael O'Brien and the figures were subsequently quoted in the Irish media.</P>
      <P>It is not possible from Companies Office records to identify companies that wish or claim to be non-resident. Moreover, the experience of the Revenue Commissioners has been that many companies which are incorporated fail to respond to queries sent by the Revenue Commissioners. While some of them are, undoubtedly, IRNRs, no accurate figure can be given as to how many there are.</P>
      <P>The IRNR problem has been a source of concern for many years and increasingly so since the early part of this decade. In discussions with their counterparts, for example, officials of the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank have received requests for information in respect of Irish registered companies that are engaging in undesirable activities, such as money laundering and fraud, in other jurisdictions. The Garda bureau of fraud investigation has received numerous requests from authorities in other countries regarding specific companies that are under investigation for illegal activity in other jurisdictions. Deputy Owen, when she was Minister, saw at first hand the logistical situation in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the Department's files there are newspaper cuttings dating back to 1992 which variously recount the activities of Irish registered companies. Headlines such as &ldquo;£18m deals link Ferruzzi to Dublin&rdquo; in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 5 September 1993 dealt with alleged irregularities in consultancy expenses. Another headline in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>of 17 May 1992 read &ldquo;Worldwide fraudsters use Dublin home as HQ&rdquo;. <i>The Irish Times</i> carried an article, headlined &ldquo;Irish-registered &lsquo;shelf' companies linked to corruption in Russia&rdquo;. An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 25 September 1995 carried the headline &ldquo;Fraud fast and loose in Dublin&rdquo;. These offer a flavour of some of the articles which have appeared in the press in recent years. Deputies will also recall the extensive debates on this issue which occurred in 1998, which also led to much coverage in the media. Essentially, I am giving a flavour of the extent to which Irish registered non-resident companies have featured over the years in articles dealing with illegal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies also asked about the strike off of companies, particularly since last year. Using existing provisions, the Registrar of Companies has been engaged in a process of striking off companies. This is directed at those companies which have failed to submit their annual returns for two years. Since October 1998, 25,117 companies have <Col N="1010" /> been struck off. Notices initiating the strike off process have been issued to a further 44,438 companies and it is likely that a significant number of these companies will also be struck off unless they regularise their affairs in the immediate future. Section 46 will enhance the ability of the Companies Registration Office to pursue those companies which fail to comply with their filing obligations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen made the point that the £20,000 bond is the equivalent of or an alternative to the resident director. The resident director can be targeted in the first instance; the bond is an alternative. Where a company fails to meet its responsibilities, a fine or penalty can then be levied. The strike off proposal by the Companies Registration Office at the request of the Revenue Commissioners will be introduced on Committee Stage. Our obligations under European Union law must also be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that, in developing the proposals, every effort was made to ensure the requirements were designed in such a way that none of our obligations under European Union treaties was transgressed. It must be remembered that these provisions are designed to tackle abuses such as fraud and money laundering which, in the context of the European Union, have also been the subject of other measures. Ireland was the only country in the EU which did not treat for tax purposes companies registered in this jurisdiction as resident. Ireland was availed of in ways which could not be allowed continue. It was vital to implement measures which would tackle and eradicate the problem. I am satisfied the measures proposed do not infringe our treaty obligations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen made the point that companies must have an Irish resident director on board or a bond. The alternative to a bond has been included to ensure we comply with European Union requirements with regard to right of establishment and ensure we do not discriminate against people from other member states wishing to set up companies here and for whom having an Irish resident director would be an undue burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I will expand on that point as we proceed. Deputy Rabbitte said the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has 13 investigations ongoing and queried the difficulties regarding publication of some of the reports. These matters are ongoing. This issue will arise in the context of Deputy Rabbitte's Bill published earlier this year, namely the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also said the examiner process may be abused by companies which traded recklessly. The introduction of the test of there being a reasonable prospect of survival and the availability of the independent accountant's report are designed to address this issue and I am satisfied this is the most appropriate method. <Col N="1011" /> Regarding independent accountants, the legislation means what it says when it refers to independent accountants. If a large group conducts the accounts and auditing of the affairs of a company and that company requires examinership, I cannot see how anyone within that group, apart from a director or otherwise, could have any part in providing an independent report on the company for the courts. It would have to be separate and from another group of accountants. I cannot see how the independence could be sustainable otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said the cost of examinership may increase because of the independent accountant's report. The information required in the report is covered under existing legislation, the so-called 21 day report. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that introducing the concept of an independent accountant's report will increase the overall cost of examinership to companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen made the point about the requirement to either have an Irish resident director or a bond of £20,000. We wanted to have an Irish resident director only, but after clear legal advice to us, it was obvious we needed the alternative to meet our European Union obligations. The legal advice recommended that and we have included it. There are advantages in having both in that both the director and the bond can be targeted rather than having a zero rated situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte made a point about &ldquo;big-ticket leasing&rdquo;. While the company law review group suggested specific measures might be necessary, the changes in sections 18 and 28 will address these in another way. The reason for this change is that the Supreme Court held that the provision of section 7(5) of the 1990 Act enables an examiner to repudiate any contract entered into by a company. This includes contracts entered into by a company prior to the appointment of an examiner. This could have a serious impact on Irish business by undermining the reliability of contracts entered into with Irish companies, especially as far as international companies are concerned, and our credibility would be called into question. It means that someone transacting business with an Irish company cannot be certain that contracts will be honoured if an examiner is subsequently appointed to that company.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to limit the circumstances where a contract can be rescinded to those instances where an examiner has already been appointed and the management, who normally continue to run the business while the examiner is preparing his rescue proposals, enter into a contract which the examiner considers inappropriate. An exception to this new provision relates to the so-called negative pledges. Examiners will be permitted to rescind negative pledges entered into by a company prior to the appointment of an examiner to <Col N="1012" /> facilitate the financing of the company during the examination period.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that the liabilities incurred by the company to which an examiner has been appointed and which have been certified by the examiner should be paid in full. However, in future, these will rank after fixed securities thereby giving additional protection to secure creditors. As the ability to secure debts is an important element of the financing of commercial activity in the country, any doubt over the value of a security, especially a fixed security, impacts on the availability and cost of credit to Irish business.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation, there will also be a focus on companies which have a reasonable prospect of survival, and the courts will be furnished in all cases with the funding report setting out how the company's trading will be financed during the examinership period. Furthermore, as the period of examinership will be shortened, there should be less need for the examiner to certify liabilities. For all these reasons, I am satisfied the rebalancing between the different interests provided for in section 28 is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte made another point about the minority report in the company law review group. The minority report of the group related to the inclusion of salaries, etc., of employees of companies seeking to be entered into examinership in the independent accountant's report with a view to their payment in all cases at all times. I have taken the view that the legislation should not be prescriptive in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte made another point that the proposals regarding the single financial regulator may overtake the contents of section 6. As a decision has not been made about the report, I am satisfied we should proceed with the proposal. Obviously it should be kept under review as other decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>Deputies Owen and Rabbitte referred to the impact of measures already taken in the Companies Registration Office. I acknowledge the work done there by Deputies Richard Bruton and Rabbitte when in office. Obviously the lack of financial resources over the years was a major difficulty in investing in many State services, including the Companies Registration Office. It is regrettable that successive Governments neglected to provide the necessary resources to keep checks and balances on company performances. I continued Deputies Bruton's and Rabbitte's work and made further resources and staff available. We now have in the Companies Registration Office one of the most efficient and sophisticated public service operations. I salute the Registrar and his staff and thank them for their work. I acknowledge the work done by Deputy Rabbitte in that regard as one of my predecessors and thank him for that.</P>
    <P>The Government package to tackle the IRNR problem was announced on 11 February 1999. From that date, the change in residency for tax purposes took effect for any new companies <Col N="1013" /> which are incorporated. It is interesting to note that the trend of incorporations, which had been increasing over recent years, appears to have reduced in the period since the announcement was made, when compared with the same period last year. For example, the following figures show how incorporations have gone: 1,621 companies were incorporated in January 1998 and 1,633 in January this year; 1,567 in February last year and 1,595 in February this year; 2,481 in March 1998 and 1,914 in March 1999; and 3,166 in April last year and 1,649 in April this year. While the fall-off in March was relatively significant at about 25 per cent, the fall-off in April was even more significant resulting in a decrease of almost 50 per cent. However, these figures can be influenced by other factors such as the level of economic activity or the stage at which proposed projects lie. It will be some time before one can be certain that the measures we have introduced in tax law, which are now being complemented by the provisions in Part lV, have the desired effect of tackling the IRNR problem. We gave this matter a great deal of consideration and consulted widely in respect of it. We felt that the changes to tax law to which I referred would make a major contribution to resolving the problem. We are confident they are working but we cannot be certain because the new tax laws must be in place for a year before an objective analysis can be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming inquired about the number of companies which have used the examinership process. Section 12 of the 1990 Act requires information to be sent to the Companies Registration Office. Annual statistics are included in companies annual reports submitted by the Minister under the Companies Act. The figures for the years subsequent to 1994 are as follows: for the four years 1995-98, there were 38 applications to the court for the appointment of an examiner, 48 court orders were made to appoint examiners and 18 court orders were made to confirm the scheme of arrangements. Based on those figures, it cannot be said that anyone has been able to abuse the examinership process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte inquired about the company law review group recommendations that are not being implemented. The main recommendation not being implemented is that at paragraph 2.30, namely, that a statutory requirement to pay VAT, PAYE and PRSI be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming inquired about the number of companies availing of examinership. As he is aware, the examinership process is designed for companies in some difficulty. In a time of economic boom, such as Ireland has experienced in recent years, with record growth rates and increasing numbers of people in work, the number of companies encountering difficulties will not be as significant as in times of lower rates of economic growth. This is probably the main reason for the relatively small number of companies availing of this legislation and long may that continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Deputy Fleming stated that the preparation of an independent accountant's report could cause a receiver to be appointed. I suggest that section 9 will cover this. The ten days stipulated include Saturday and Sunday, therefore, the ten day period is continuous and there can be no procrastination. When a crisis occurs, a company makes an application and has ten days to produce an independent accountant's report. If the report is not received within the ten day period, the case is not valid. I am satisfied that ten days is appropriate and it gives people a reasonable period within which to produce an independent accountant's report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming also referred to the issue of residency. This is defined in section 44(8) and it is, therefore, a company law concept.</P>

      <P>I accept that. I am aware that Deputies raised a number of other issues. Many of these are not directly pertinent to the current legislation and, accordingly, I have not responded directly to them. Deputies will be aware that their contributions are on record and our Department will examine these in the context of legislative proposals brought forward in the specific areas to which the comments relate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate on the Companies <Col N="1015" /> (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999. Their contributions were wide-ranging, detailed and positive. I have worked for ten years in nine different Departments and I pay special tribute to the staff of the companies law divisions of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I have dealt with many public and civil servants in the past and the quality of their contributions, intellectually and otherwise, has been outstanding. I thank them sincerely for the work they have done under tremendous pressure in recent years to ensure that proper legislation was introduced in this area.</P>
    <P>This is a complex Bill. In light of the fact that no one has a monopoly on wisdom, I have always been open to good ideas from all Members, particularly those in Opposition. I look forward to the proposals that may be put forward on Committee Stage. If the amendments put forward are positive, sensible, practical and capable of implementation, they will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader of the House and the Opposition for facilitating the early introduction of the Bill and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage. I thank Members for their attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Government for providing time to debate this very important legislation which is a central part of the collective response that must be forthcoming from us, the political community, and the community as a whole, to the horrifying facts with which we have had to come to terms, namely, that our society was based on a sham and that the image we had of ourselves as a people who care for and love children hid so much horrible abuse beneath the surface &ndash; an abuse of the most vulnerable of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a much worse blow to our concept of ourselves than all the financial scandals that have been unveiled because it is a much more fundamental abuse of power. While the golden circles <Col N="1016" /> of power and influence which are the subject of tribunals of inquiry forged their profitable bonds at the centre of Irish society, different circles, circles of cold stone, went unnoticed at the far fringes of the social sphere. If it is important, and it is, to throw light on circles of privilege and self-interest involving politicians, developers, big business and financial institutions, it is more important to throw light on the other extreme of social influence, namely, those with no power.</P>
    <P>Imprisoned in those stone circles were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children who were in the so-called care of the State, religious institutions or warped and abusive parents. Windows of light were rare and when they did exist those who looked in did not seem to see what was happening inside. Those diametrically different experiences of life in Ireland in the not so distant past, perhaps even in the present, represent, in their different ways, gross abuse of power. From my perspective, the physical and sexual abuse of helpless children is the most gross and the most deserving of investigation.</P>
    <P>Much investigative reporting, many column inches and a great deal of Dáil time have been devoted to questioning the activities of the socially and economically powerful. We want to know what happened, and rightly so. Let us be just as rigorous in pursuing those who wielded power in less prestigious circles but with more destructive results in the lives of individuals. The television series &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, Susan McKay's book about Sophia McColgan, Paddy Doyle's <i>The God Squad</i>, Annie Ryan's <i>Walls of Silence</i> and the personal testimonies of many brave survivors compel the urge to find retrospective justice or, at the very least, an acknowledgement of the enormity of the harm that was done.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has spoken to a survivor of child abuse, particularly sexual abuse, will know how important it is to them to have confirmation from someone outside the circle of abuse that what happened actually took place, that it was wrong and that it was not their fault. There is a compelling need to tell their story so that they can move on and reconstruct their lives. There is also a compelling need to see justice done. For many justice is not available.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to make it possible for some of those who are now restricted from seeking justice by the statute of limitations to do so.</P>
    <P>The RTE series, &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; has brought the appalling hidden history of abuse in State-financed institutions to public notice in an unprecedented fashion. Mary Raftery and her team are to be congratulated for the service they have done. A comprehensive response is essential and has to focus on four broad areas. First, individual experience, hurt, needs and recovery of those who were abused.</P>
    <P>In answer to a parliamentary question which I tabled on 3 March 1999, the Minister for Education and Science informed me that proceedings <Col N="1017" /> had been initiated in 145 cases relating to his Department, involving allegations of sexual or other physical abuse of children in institutions which were operated by or on behalf of the State or which were funded from public funds. I have no doubt the number has grown since. A large number of cases has also been initiated against religious orders who ran institutions, school teachers and individuals, some fathers, who have perpetrated sexual and physical abuse on their own children. An article in <i>Magill </i>magazine in February 1999 estimated that at that time 560 child abuse victims were suing the State and the Catholic church. Only this week, media reports indicated that the Garda is investigating 230 complaints against 75 Christian Brothers at Artane boys' school. The sheer scale of abuse in this institution alone is hard to comprehend.</P>
    <P>The second response is the requirement to thoroughly and rigorously examine why it happened and what were the factors that allowed it to happen without effective intervention.</P>
    <P>The third requirement is to ensure that all children who were placed in industrial schools and other care are given access to their records and that the State and the institutions concerned adopt a rigorous and open approach to searching out these records and to making them available to the people concerned. I, and I am sure other Members, have received letters from people who are extremely anxious to secure this information. I ask the Minister to include that in the various measures being adopted.</P>
    <P>The fourth requirement is to put structures in place to facilitate meting out whatever justice can be made available. No recompense can go near to compensating for the appalling abuses perpetrated, the childhoods taken away, the process of growing and developing that is the right of every child warped and destroyed, but we must provide whatever recompense is possible. This Bill is central to that process and it will cost the State money. It will allow people to seek legal retribution from the State and from others. How could anyone justify not doing so? How could anyone suggest that victims of child abuse should be free to go to court if they are 20 years of age but not if they are 22? </P>
    <P>Sophia McColgan's story makes it clear how unfair that statute is in terms of the effect of child abuse on the victim. Susan McKay's book takes us painstakingly through the years of abuse that took place within the McColgan family. Despite Sophia and her brother taking every chance that arose to tell what was going on to anyone they came in contact with, particularly in the health service, there was not any intervention. Sophia had to literally construct a life for herself before she could take the enormous and terrifying step of challenging her father who had destroyed her childhood and that of her brothers and sisters.</P>
    <P>She could not develop to adulthood in the normal, gradual way of other children. She con<Col N="1018" /> structed a survival technique of taking her consciousness out of her own body when she was being sexually abused by her father. She quite simply would have been unable to stand up to him without first making a persona for herself that would be taken seriously by the outside world. She and her brother never succeeded in getting themselves taken seriously when they were children, despite broken limbs and other clear evidence of abuse. Sophia got a degree to give herself standing and self-respect. Her childhood experience would suggest she did right.</P>
    <P>When Sophia McColgan sought legal redress against the North Western Health Board and the family GP for their failure to intervene in her and her siblings' case, they put forward the Statute of Limitations as part of their defence. Because she had allowed more than three years to elapse after her 18th birthday before initiating proceedings, they claimed she was statute barred. Since the case was settled out of court it did not become the subject of a legal precedent.</P>
    <P>Media reports indicate there is every reason to believe the insurance company which represents the health boards will be willing to use the Statute of Limitations in current cases if it remains unchanged. Therefore, there is an urgency to complete this amending legislation. A case before Mr. Justice Kelly, prior to his resignation, which dealt with Madonna House and involved the Statute of Limitations, will have to be reheard. That case may have involved a legal judgment but, if so, it is not available to us.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, which I published last year, had its genesis in the difficulties encountered by Sophia McColgan in her search for justice. Recent revelations have again highlighted the obstacles the statutes present. In this Bill I am seeking to remove the restriction of the statutes in cases of childhood abuse.</P>
    <P>The statutes of limitation set out certain deadlines within which actions for damages must be brought. Generally, an action for personal injuries must be initiated within three years of the occurrence of the act complained of. There is, however, provision in the legislation that time does not run while the potential plaintiff is under a &ldquo;disability&rdquo;. Being under a disability is generally understood to mean either that the plaintiff is under the age of majority &ndash; 18 years of age &ndash; or that he or she is of unsound mind. If neither of these two criteria apply, a plaintiff has no excuse for not initiating proceedings within the strict statutory period.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to allow for an extended definition of disability, so as to accommodate circumstances of childhood abuse. It is a short and targeted Bill. Section 1 contains a standard provision relating to the Bill's short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a person shall, for the purposes of the Statutes of Limitation, be <Col N="1019" /> regarded as under a disability where, by reason of significant emotional or mental injury suffered by that person and attributable to the act complained of &ndash; being an act of physical or sexual abuse committed against that person when he or she was a child &ndash; the ability of that person to make reasoned decisions to bring an action in respect thereof is substantially impaired. Effectively, an extended definition is given to &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, to include persons who, although of entirely sound mind, may not have been in a position, as a result of the injuries which they have suffered, to have taken appropriate action against those who have assaulted them.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides a saver clause, in line with current judicial practice, which retains the power of a court to stay an action in circumstances where, given the passage of time since the acts complained of, the initiation of proceedings would be fundamentally unfair to a defendant. I thank Finbar O'Malley for his expert help in drafting this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, encompasses physical abuse, including sexual abuse. Non-sexual abuse should be addressed in this context rather than be referred to the Law Reform Commission, as indicated in the Taoiseach's speech on 11 May when he announced the measures relating to childhood abuse following the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programmes.</P>
    <P>I do not believe victims of severe physical attacks, some of which were graphically described on television, should have to wait again. Broken teeth, broken limbs and head injuries add up to serious assaults and gross abuses of power. Sexual and physical abuse have often been perpetrated at the same time. I urge the Minister to retain the integrity of the legislation in this regard.</P>
    <P>While on the surface this Bill may appear to be aimed at securing monetary compensation for victims of child abuse, it has a more significant intent. We have all learned the importance to victims of coming to terms with their personal histories. Court action in these cases has far more to do with the public acknowledgement of injustice done and the vindication of rights than with financial compensation. The commission which was announced by the Government, in response to the exposures regarding industrial schools, may recommend the setting up of a compensation tribunal. That may happen, but I would not be opposed to it. This amending legislation and the court process would provide a back up and an alternative to those who wish to take that route.</P>
    <P>I just received a report relating to the Canadian experience; other Members may also have received it. A commission was set up there to deal with institutional child abuse and the report contains much detail about how the issue was approached. We could probably learn much from it. Research was commissioned on how the issue of redress and the broader issues in relation to compensation and coming to terms with child <Col N="1020" /> abuse should be dealt with by society as a whole. I hope to read the report in more detail before Committee Stage. We probably have much to learn from countries such as Canada.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government for facilitating this debate. By removing legalistic obstacles to justice, we are taking a small but important step in facing up to what was done to so many children. We must not let this issue drift out of the limelight. We must put in place the necessary measures to ensure that there is no hiding place for abusers. The social services inspectorate, which was recently announced, the register of sex offenders and an ombudsman for children are some of the special measures on which I ask the Minister and his colleagues to give a definite timeframe. I look forward to the publication of the White Paper on mandatory reporting to which the Taoiseach referred when he announced the measures. I am interested to know when that White Paper will be published and the entire issue debated.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is determined to ensure that the Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill and the constitutional matters relating to the rights of the child are addressed. The shortage of trained child care staff is causing concern to health boards and this must also be urgently addressed if we are to be in a position to put procedures into practice. When announcing the various measures, the Taoiseach said £4 million would be allocated to the establishment of a counselling service. He indicated that this funding would have to be phased because of the shortage of trained and appropriate staff in the counselling area.</P>
    <P>This issue is important and members of health boards &ndash; Deputy Neville is also a member of the Mid-Western Health Board &ndash; have become aware of the difficulty in recruiting child care staff. Educational establishments must be urgently approached to ensure that appropriate staff are available to health boards and other organisations to deal with this matter. If that is not done, it will be difficult to put all our plans into practice.</P>
    <P>There is still evidence of homeless children begging on the streets. Given such facts, we cannot say that all the neglect is in the past. Many speakers mentioned during the recent debates the need to deal with the present as well as the past. The Bill is a major part of the Labour Party's legislative programme and I hope it is the first of many Bills which will be accepted by the Government. There is no more important issue confronting us as a society than the protection of children. The Bill is part of the necessary process of confronting our shameful past in this regard and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to welcome the principle underlying the Bill on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government and to congratulate Deputy O'Sullivan on her initiative in bringing it forward. I wish to first put <Col N="1021" /> into context the Government's approach to the important question with which the Bill deals. The period within which civil actions should be taken forms only a part, albeit a very important one, of the Government's comprehensive approach to the whole issue of abuse in childhood.</P>
      <P>On 11 May the Taoiseach announced a broad package of measures exemplifying the Government's proactive stance in this sensitive area. The main features of this package are an apology on behalf of the State to victims of child abuse; the setting up of a commission to inquire into childhood abuse; expansion nationwide of the counselling services available to assist victims of child abuse; the preparation of a White Paper on the mandatory reporting of child abuse; immediate amendment of the limitation laws as they relate to civil actions based on childhood sexual abuse; referral of the question of limitation in other forms of childhood abuse to the Law Reform Commission and priority advancement of legislation to include a register of sex offenders.</P>
      <P>A most significant element of the Taoiseach's announcement was the statement of apology made to victims of child abuse. This unreserved apology was made on behalf of the Government and previous Governments and of the State generally. In the statements on the matter in the House recently, it was common to hear Deputies on all sides join in the making of that apology. More important is the response from those who endured those terrible times in their past and whose childhood was stolen. No one expects them to forgive or forget easily. The hope is that the State can somehow facilitate a form of reconciliation so that the terrible imbalance and burden in their young lives and in later years can be lifted to some degree.</P>
      <P>There is much work to be done in redressing those wrongs. A significant step in this process is the setting up of the commission to inquire into childhood abuse. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, has already announced the membership of the commission, which will comprise Ms Justice Laffoy of the High Court and two respected and experienced professionals from the field of child care and abuse therapy. The Government's strategy of establishing the commission first on a non-statutory basis and with broad terms of reference means that the initial experiences gained by the commission will inform a considered approach to the question of redrawing its terms of reference or investing it with any legislative powers it may need to complete its work satisfactorily. This approach has been given a broad welcome inside and outside the House and I am confident that the high calibre of its membership will ensure that it will develop a wide acceptance from all concerned when it gets down to work and starts the process of identifying more fully what it needs to do and how it should go about doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Government's plan of wide ranging measures, there is a commitment to expand the <Col N="1022" /> services available for counselling of those who have lived through abuse in childhood with the aim of providing a service of a uniformly high professional standard throughout the State to all who need it. There is no instant solution to the expansion of these services. The right people need to be recruited and given the right training and this will take time. The intention of the Government is to build on the expertise and experience that already exist and to develop quickly from there to meet the special demands that will undoubtedly be placed on services.</P>
    <P>There is a growing frankness in the way people are now prepared to debate child sexual abuse, a topic which until not too long ago was almost taboo. The courage of those who have suffered such abuse and who wish to speak out about their deepest personal experiences means that every one of us, in one form or another, is increasingly aware of the tragic circumstances of the past and of the problems which now need to be addressed. Further new laws and the enhancement of our services to meet the issues will feature in the Government's programme of action.</P>
    <P>The Government has been progressing a considerable number of measures to date. In May last year I published my discussion paper on the law on sexual offences. Much of the paper deals with offences against children and in response to the submissions received on the paper, I sought and recently obtained Government approval for the preparation of a package of legislative measures designed to protect children and other vulnerable persons against sex offenders.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the package will be the setting up of a registration procedure for convicted sex offenders who, on their release from prison, will have to notify their names and addresses to the Garda. The system to be introduced will be what is known as a tracking system, a means for the Garda to be aware at all times of the current addresses of convicted sex offenders who, on their release from prison, will have to notify their name and address to the Garda. Any subsequent changes to their names and addresses will have to be similarly notified. Failure to notify will be an offence. The length of time on the register will be set out in the Bill by reference to the seriousness of the offence, with some modification for juvenile offenders.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the gardaí, in consultation with the relevant State agencies, such as the probation and welfare service and the health boards, will undertake continuous risk assessment of those who are subject to the registration requirement. Information will be disclosed to other persons only in the most exceptional circumstances to prevent an immediate risk of crime or to alert members of the public to an apprehended danger, and then only on a strict &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis. In addition, the proposed Bill will contain tough new provisions that will empower the courts to make civil orders against convicted sex offenders whose behaviour in the community gives the gardaí cause for concern, and to order sex <Col N="1023" /> offenders to be subject to probation and welfare service supervision on their release from prison.</P>
    <P>Another significant innovation I will introduce is separate legal representation for complainants in rape and serious sexual assault cases during applications to hear evidence and cross-examine on a complainant's previous sexual experience. Since such applications are heard in the absence of the jury, the argument that the accused would be prejudiced by the complainant's legal representation does not arise. I also hope to include in the package measures aimed at reducing the scope for sex offenders to obtain work that involves unsupervised access to children. Work on the preparation of the Bill has been given priority in my Department. The heads of the Bill were circulated to all Departments earlier this month. The planned date of publication is in the next session.</P>
    <P>In the context of the employment of sex offenders, arrangements are in place since 1994 whereby the Garda authorities carry out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements, which were introduced by my predecessor at the request of the Department of Health in response to allegations of abuse of children in residential child care centres, are implemented by the Garda authorities in strict adherence to legal advice received in the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern for me that a large number of organisations with responsibility for child care, who engage staff ranging from full-time paid staff to voluntary staff, are not currently covered by the existing Garda clearance arrangements for full-time employees in the health care area. I wish to see these arrangements extended as quickly as possible to cover persons who would have regular unsupervised contact with children or other vulnerable persons, irrespective of whether that is in a health care setting.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Garda Commissioner has been urgently undertaking a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in the child care area generally. This review is clearly of the utmost importance, relating as it does to the security and safety of children but, inevitably, it is also essential to safeguard the privacy and other rights of individuals. Accordingly, the modalities for operating the extended Garda clearance arrangements envisaged require careful consideration. I am informed by the Garda authorities that this review is progressing quickly and I hope to make a further statement on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that, irrespective of the new arrangements introduced in this area in the future, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not <Col N="1024" /> the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs, particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage &ndash; good interviewing practice, checking references, etc. &ndash; and when it comes to adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>
    <P>Statutory measures relating to child sex abuse already in place as a result of my initiatives include the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996. That Act provides that Irish citizens who commit sexual offences against children when abroad can be dealt with on their return to this country as if the offence had taken place here. The Act also targets the organisers of sex tourism by making it an offence to arrange transport for child sex tourists or to publish information on child sex tourism. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, gives effect to the EU Joint Action on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Exploitation of Children in so far as it applies to children. It provides for a detailed definition of child pornography and creates new child trafficking and child pornography offences, some of which are punishable by up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Statute of Limitations Bill before the House today will add considerably to the code of law that exists for child sexual abuse, and while the Government has proposals in this area, we have no hesitation in accepting the principle of Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill in so far as it applies to child sexual abuse. The Government accepts there is a need for some clarification on how the law on limitation of actions should apply in the case of a person who has been abused in childhood but does not proceed for some time against the perpetrator, the perpetrator's employers or those responsible for failing to prevent the abuse.</P>
    <P>The law on limitation of civil actions is a balance between two conflicting rights, the right of a person to proceed in court for the redress of a wrong as against the right of a person to proceed about his or her normal business in the knowledge that there is no risk of stale claims being brought. In the balance also is the wider public interest identified by the Supreme Court in the case of Touhy <i>v.</i> Courtney in 1994 in avoiding stale or delayed claims. The question of the balance of rights has exercised the minds of academics, practitioners and legislators in many other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>In our jurisdiction, the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, has been the basis for the law on limitation of civil actions. Only one significant amendment has been made to that statute since, the amending act of 1991. Up to that point, the position was that a person had three years from the date of accrual of a cause of action for personal injuries based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty within which to commence proceedings. That three year period did not start to run during any period where the person was under a disability. Section 48 of the Act specifies <Col N="1025" /> that a person is under a disability while not of full age, while of unsound mind or while a convict in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The significant change brought about by the 1991 amending Act was to introduce the concept of &ldquo;discoverability&rdquo; to limitation law as it relates to personal injuries cases based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty. The effect of this is that if an injured party does not know he or she has been injured by the wrongful act or omission in question at the time it occurred, the three year period does not begin to run until such time as the person discovers, or could reasonably have discovered, the injury.</P>
    <P>The 1991 amendment was made on the basis of a report on the matter by the Law Reform Commission. That report analysed the approaches to the question of discoverability taken in other jurisdictions as well as the framework of Irish law, both constitutional and statutory, into which such a change would have to be integrated, before arriving at a detailed set of recommendations for amendment of the law. The need for detailed precision of language in the amendment of this technical area of the law is apparent from the Commission's report and the resulting Act.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has also recently produced a consultation paper on another aspect of limitation law, the law as it should apply to latent non-personal damage arising from professional negligence. This would cover such matters as negligent surveying of a building where defects may not become apparent to the occupier for years or defective legal advice given to a purchaser on the title to a property which may not emerge until the person concerned tries to sell the property. The commission has been examining this area on my initiative in response to questions concerning policy in the law which arose in the case of Touhy <i>v.</i> Courtney, which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Any change in the law on limitations needs careful research and teasing out of the implications so that, as legislators, we can be satisfied that the changes we make achieve exactly the policy aims we intend to fulfil. That is why, following on the McColgan case and the article on the matter written by their counsel, Mr James Nugent SC, and published in the Bar Review of March 1998, one approach was to refer the matter of limitation periods in child abuse cases to the Law Reform Commission to have the benefit of that body's acknowledged experience in dealing with various aspects of the law of limitations.</P>
    <P>However, on further reflection on the whole matter of child abuse by the Cabinet sub-committee, which led to the overall strategy of the Government as announced by the Taoiseach on 11 May, the Government is satisfied that the way to proceed is by way of early amendment of the Statutes of Limitation as they apply to child sex abuse and to provide a dedicated package of legislative and support measures as well as the establishment of the commission. The Government is happy, therefore, to agree the Bill on limi<Col N="1026" /> tations before the House subject to what the Government regards as important policy and legal or technical amendments.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts that special rules must be seen to apply to limitation periods in child sex abuse cases. Society has always regarded as evil any form of sexual activity in relation to young children. Sexual acts by those in a position of perceived or actual power in relation to young persons have always been wrong, and the criminal law in particular rightly regards those acts as heinous. However, criminal law in general does not operate a system of periods of limitation for serious offences within which legal proceedings must be brought. By contrast, the civil law has, in this as in other jurisdictions, always operated such a system, with few exceptions.</P>
    <P>There is now public awareness of the feelings of guilt and shame which can be induced in those who are made objects of sexual abuse even though they are blameless. We now know better, that these feelings of shame and self-blame can paralyse the will and the ability of otherwise rational people when it comes to dealing with the consequences of the abuse they have suffered. Apart altogether from entering on the path of litigation, many such victims will have difficulty in bringing themselves to avail of the counselling and psychotherapeutic services they need. Often until they have availed themselves of such services over a considerable period they are unable psychologically even to consider what remedies may be available through the courts. The Government's view is that the case for changing the law of limitation as it applies to child sex abuse cases is unanswerable. That is why it is pleased to be able to offer its support in principle to this Bill.</P>
    <P>With other forms of child abuse, however, the issues are not always as clear-cut as in the case of sex abuse. Questions arise from the wide range of activities which, at one end of the scale, would have been classed until not too long ago as reasonable corporal punishment and, at the other end of the scale, are by any standard unacceptable but may not affect the ability of a person to take legal proceedings in a given time. The Government's view is that it needs to obtain the advice of experts on whether and to what extent other forms of abuse are likely to have the inhibiting effect on the victim long into adult life that is known to occur in many instances of childhood sex abuse.</P>
    <P>Some other jurisdictions have modified their laws in respect of sexual abuse in childhood but not in relation to other forms of childhood abuse. Research needs to be undertaken into the position in a wide range of other jurisdictions so that we can benefit from the experiences of those states which have taken a wider or a narrower approach to the issue of limitation periods for various forms of childhood abuse, understand why different approaches have been taken in different countries and apply the most appropri<Col N="1027" /> ate reasoning gleaned from that research to whatever changes we should make in our law.</P>
    <P>The Government has, accordingly, decided to ask the Law Reform Commission to give early examination to the issues and to make recommendations. The Attorney General has this week referred the matter to the commission. It is well placed to deal with the matter, having dealt with other substantial aspects of limitation law in the recent past. In light of that referral, I will be moving an amendment to the Bill confining its application to actions arising out of sexual abuse in childhood. When the Law Reform Commission's report becomes available, the Government will be in a better position to assess what further changes need to be made in the law and to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>I now address some more detailed aspects of the Bill. I assure Deputies, especially Deputy O'Sullivan, that these comments are offered in a spirit of co-operation and are motivated by the wish, which I am sure is shared by Deputies on all sides of the House, that we put in place changes which will achieve what we want to achieve without any unexpected and undesirable effects.</P>
    <P>The scope of the legal disability provided for in the Bill appears to go beyond what is intended to be covered. As framed, the Bill would permit a person to bring a late claim in respect of, say, a car accident or even the sale of defective goods on the basis of a disability related to child sex abuse at the time that the accident occurred or the purchase was made. It appears to be a matter for further consideration by the House as to whether the disability in question in the Bill would need to be defined on a more specific basis. Accordingly, I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage which would link the disability closely with the pursuit of proceedings arising out of the abuse and not extend it to all other forms of legal proceedings to which the concept of disability under the Statutes of Limitation applies by virtue of section 49 of the 1957 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in describing the injury which impairs the bringing of an action, uses the expression &ldquo;emotional or mental&rdquo;. There may be a case for following the lead of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, which uses instead the word &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; to convey the circumstances of the person bringing the action. I understand this word was used so as to encompass the mental and emotional welfare of the victim of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the most recent amendment of the Statutes of Limitation in the 1991 Act. That Act provides, in section 7, for the application of the new provisions to all causes of action accruing whether before or after the passing of that Act and to proceedings in being at the time of the passing. A provision of that kind would need to be made in the Bill so as to make the policy of the Bill more clear. As the Bill <Col N="1028" /> stands, there is the possibility that it could be interpreted as not being retrospective in its application to cases which arose before the passing of the Bill. If that were the case, the Bill would fail to meet the Government's objective. which is that retrospection is an essential element of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters that will be the subject of Government amendments when we come to debate the matter on Committee Stage. The amendments will be brought forward, as are these comments, in a spirit of co-operation on the basis of the Government's support for the principle of the Bill as it applies to childhood sexual abuse cases. I assure the Deputy on my own behalf and that of the Government that whatever assistance can be made available in steering this Bill through the parliamentary process and onto the Statute Book will be offered.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to this Bill follows an announcement of its commitments to the subject of child abuse. It is the response of a Government which is willing to share responsibility for whatever action the House, society and the community we live in can and must take to remedy the wrongs of the past and to try to ensure that they do not happen in the future.</P>

        <b>:</b> I join with the Minister in offering my congratulations to Deputy O'Sullivan for introducing this Bill. It is timely, opportune and overdue. As a result of the tremendous work done by her and her advisers in producing the Bill a major obstacle to victims of abuse in getting compensation for the pain, suffering and damage inflicted on them will have been removed.</P>
      <P>Society owes a considerable debt of gratitude to Mary Raferty, producer of the television series &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, to researcher, Síle Ahern, and to RTE for jolting the conscience of the nation and for again holding up a mirror to politicians and society to show how totally inadequate and piecemeal our approach has been to the physical and sexual abuse of children. It has taken television series, such as &ldquo;Dear Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, to achieve what years of campaigning by child care organisations have failed to achieve. Maybe now we will finally put in place a comprehensive and effective child care and child protection regime rather than the piecemeal policy announcements of the past, many of which appeared in the wake of media revelations of individual scandals or of published reports into personal tragedies. The reality is that public and political interest in child care and the protection of children has been one of ebb and flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Taoiseach's long overdue apology on behalf of all of us to the victims of abuse and the Government's proposed truth com<Col N="1029" /> mission announced by the Minister for Education and Science, current Government policy has been one of lethargy and inaction. The Goldenbridge revelations struck at the heart of the public conscience. All kinds of commitments were given; prominent among them was a State funded counselling service for the victims of institutional abuse. Suddenly all kinds of legal complications were thrown up and the proposal was abandoned and it did not reappear until today.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised a register of sex offenders and pulled back from the promise when he bought time by setting up a commission to report on sexual offences. The completed report alluded to by the Minster again today was completed and brought before the Dáil in May 1998. Not alone has the Minister failed to follow up with the promised register of sex offenders, he voted down a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, sponsored by my colleague, Deputy Neville, which would have given effect to what the Minister promised in the past and again today but failed to deliver. The Government's legislative programme published on 19 April last excluded the proposed Bill from the list of measures to be published let alone enacted before the summer. This Bill, like many others, is lost somewhere in the realms of the Government's legislative &ldquo;also rans&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government states that a key priority of the Government would be &ldquo;mandatory reporting of child abuse&rdquo;. We are still waiting for this measure to be delivered. It is lost, closeted firmly away somewhere in the recesses of the Department of Health and Children. Yet the Taoiseach told the Dáil on Tuesday, 12 May, that a White Paper would be published &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;. Time will tell us exactly what that means.</P>
    <P>When the Government was formed two years ago, the traditional Department of Health was changed to the Department of Health and Children. The Minister for Health and Children and his Department should be pivotal when it comes to dealing with child care; they should be central to co-ordinating and driving initiatives and should be the most &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; in dealing with the current crisis in child abuse yet, strangely, they seem to be almost on the sidelines and certainly play no more than a peripheral, secondary or supporting role.</P>
    <P>This Department was presented with a substantial number of recommendations from the Kilkenny incest report in 1993, but these have not been implemented. The recommendations of the report of the committee of inquiry into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald also remain unimplemented, despite the fact that the programme for Government is clear and unequivocal when it promises &ldquo;full implementation of the recommendations of the Kilkenny Incest Inquiry report, the Kelly Fitzgerald report and the Madonna House report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again the programme for Government is very clear and specific. It commits the Government to <Col N="1030" />&ldquo;implementing the Child Care Act in full&rdquo;. Two years later, health boards are still awaiting the essential new child abuse guidelines, which have not been revised since 1988 and were to be an important follow-on following the enactment of the Child Care Act, 1991. The social services inspectorate, first promised in May 1996, following publication of the Madonna House Report is yet to be established. I hope it will appear some time later this year.</P>
    <P>Last week, a High Court judge said it was appalling that a rapist, who will be released next October without getting therapy, will be free in society. The judge ordered that man &ndash; he sent him to jail in 1996 &ndash; should be the subject of a transcript to be sent to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is nothing short of a disgrace that we have approximately 280 offenders serving prison sentences for offences of rape and sexual abuse. Many of these have offended against children. Yet there are only facilities to provide treatment and therapy for ten sex offenders. As the High Court judge said in the case of the untreated rapist, who is soon to be released, &ldquo;He is going to be let out no better than he went in&rdquo;. Dozens more will be jailed before the end of this year and only a select handful will be treated. Such abject neglect raises a major question mark over just how serious or sincere we are abut the issue of child sex abuse. The most tangible testimony of the sincerity of the Taoiseach's apology would be to address the glaring inadequacy and major deficiencies and the broken promises which litter the area of child care and child protection.</P>
    <P>Many people would like to believe that the Ireland of the 1990s will be remembered for its economic success story. It will be remembered as the decade when we turned the economic corner and forged economically ahead, moving dramatically up the European and world economic league tables. It will also be remembered as the decade of the revelations when public figures, bodies and institutions had their affairs and conduct laid bare and what was revealed was a shameful litany of scandal and abuse of power. The hidden Ireland of child abuse inside and outside residential care was not confined to the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s or the 1970s but has continued into the 1980s and 1990s. These happenings are not from the dark, dim and distant past. Many happened a mere three years ago and many are still happening today. Nothing, not the so-called expert legal advice or anything else, should stand in the way of full exposure. The full, untruncated and uncensored Madonna House report should be published now.</P>
    <P>The involvement of members of the Church has been well and truly exposed by reports and court cases. Criminal charges have been brought and must continue to be brought until the entire perverted cancer of child abuse is stamped out. The same treatment must be meted out to the child care workers who brutalised and robbed children of their childhood. Equally culpable are <Col N="1031" /> the Departments and organs of State which, in many cases, were told about and colluded with what was going on and turned a blind eye. We include among these health board officials, doctors, social workers, teachers and others who had a professional as well as a moral obligation and who did not act or speak out. There was a collective cover-up laced with crass hypocrisy, much of it perpetrated by those who railed publicly against the so-called evils of contraception and divorce while indulging in, ignoring or abetting the most sadistic paedophile activities.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as an important step in ensuring that no victim can be excluded by law from getting legal or financial redress. Under the law at present, a victim can only take legal action for up to three years after reaching the age of 18 years. The traumatic nature of sexual abuse is such that many victims would be incapable of initiating such an action until long after their eighteenth birthday. These changes, which we are putting through the House, courtesy of Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill, mean that the legal door will now be open to any person of any age who has been abused. Nobody will be debarred from initiating a damages suit. Can we take the apology of the State seriously when we are told that while it is prepared to accept the amendment to the Statute of Limitations to extend the time within which the victims of sexual abuse may claim compensation, it is currently unwilling to similarly change the law in relation to physical abuse? I would like the Law Reform Commission to consider the issue.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we have to always look over our shoulder, be foot dragging or look at examples from other countries when it is clear that abuse is abuse is abuse, whether it is of a physical, mental or sexual nature.</P>
    <P>How can we treat seriously the Taoiseach's acknowledgement that there is a need for a comprehensive policy to address the issue of child abuse when it is clear that a law which extends the time for bringing claims for sexual abuse will not immediately apply to physical abuse and, as a consequence, will be unworkable in a large number of instances in which children have been both sexually and physically abused over the years? The Statute of Limitations should be immediately changed in its application to apply to both sexual and physical abuse.</P>
    <P>All parties should move beyond simply dismantling the legal barriers. Some victims have indicated they have no interest in monetary compensation, they simply want to be believed, to tell their tales and for the truth to come out. For others, possibly a majority, there is the issue of compensation. At present there are 174 cases for compensation listed for hearing before the courts. There is a need for the State and the Church to consider a comprehensive and constructive alternative approach to court that would be adopted by such claimants. Are we at this stage going to <Col N="1032" /> force each victim of abuse to come to open court and be cross-examined on the horrors of their past? Surely the State and the Church should agree to put in place a new structure to determine compensation claims. The State should go beyond its truth commission and set up a special forum where such claims can be heard in a full and sensitive manner and processed expeditiously while keeping legal costs and expenses to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commission to inquire into childhood abuse. Its aim is commendable &ndash; to enable victims to have the opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum. It will also look into the causes of abuse in institutions and elsewhere. I trust this will include primary and secondary schools. It will also seek to establish the motives of those who carried out the abuse. It will make recommendations on the needs of those who were abused and the measures needed to safeguard children for the future.</P>
    <P>The central question, however, is what powers will it have? It must be given whatever powers it feels it needs. I note that the Minister for Education and Science has indicated he is prepared to make available all records from his Department. We also need a clear statement from the Minister for Health and Children that all relevant records from his Department and from the various health boards will be made available to the commission. We need the same commitment from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The commission must be enabled to examine in full the failure of those Departments to supervise the care provided for children for whom they had a statutory responsibility. We must know what complaints are on file and the reasons they were not followed up.</P>
    <P>The idea of an ombudsman for children has been mooted for a considerable period. I am somewhat disappointed to note that in the spate of announcements about the recent manifestations, there is no mention of, or speculation about, a children's ombudsman. At this juncture, it is an idea well worth revisiting and its merits as an institution that could wield effective power on behalf of children should be examined.</P>
    <P>In all, 46,000 children passed through the Irish industrial school system. We must pay tribute to the many good people who managed and worked in these institutions and looked after the children there. Notwithstanding the horrific abuse carried out by a minority of those who worked in the schools, many people did their best to try to fill the void left by a society and State which abdicated its responsibility and left the institutions totally unresourced. These institutions were neglected on two fronts &ndash; they were starved of resources and left mainly unregulated and unsupervised. For the children who went through those institutions, even if there never was abuse, there was the heartbreak of severance from their parents. Many of them were never visited by their parents or their immediate or extended families. <Col N="1033" /> They lost contact with their parents and were left in a state of emotional anonymity.</P>
    <P>Many of these children never managed to establish their family ties or origins. This is another huge area where the State has an obligation to provide the resources and imagination required to enable these people to trace their long lost family members. While this would be painstaking and highly skilled work, the State has an obligation in this regard because these people found themselves in such institutions because of its failure. This service should now be provided and should be an integral part of the comprehensive programme which hopefully will be put in place to make reparation and restitution for the failures and negligence of the past.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy O'Sullivan on doing society a considerable service by introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Bill and I congratulate my colleague from Limerick, Deputy O'Sullivan, on her initiative in bringing it forward. I am disappointed, however, the Government has not implemented more objectives in this legislation. It is important that the Bill extends the Statute of Limitations for both physical and sexual abuse committed against people when they were children. It is not practical to amend the law on child sexual abuse while not making the same changes as regards physical abuse. Sexual abuse is a form of physical abuse. It is impossible to separate these areas when detailing abuse which occurred ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. What arguments will be made as to which abuse was physical or sexual? There are too many cases where there is clear evidence of serious and appalling sexual abuse. This is also accompanied by physical abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in the various television reports and documentaries, as well as in Government reports, victims of abuse should have the facility to seek compensation, whether for physical or sexual abuse, where a number of years has passed since they attained adulthood and, as a consequence of the abuse suffered in childhood, have not been able to make a claim for compensation until recently. Fine Gael is concerned that this issue is properly and expeditiously addressed. It <Col N="1034" /> must be dealt with as a matter of urgency, having regard to the many hundreds of claims pending before the courts and the proposed rehearing of the case heard by Judge Cyril Kelly brought by a person seeking compensation for abuse relating to alleged incidents at Madonna House, to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred. It is essential to outline whether the Statue of Limitations will be invoked against this claimant in the proposed rehearing of the proceedings, as occurred in the original case in which Judge Kelly reserved judgment, some weeks prior to his resignation.</P>
    <P>Sexual abuse has a profound effect on the victim. Most sexually abused children suffer long-term traumatic stress disorders and can experience a range of mental health problems. They often inflict harm on themselves, either directly through deliberate injury and self-mutilation or indirectly through eating disorders and drug abuse. Once children become victims of abuse they tend to suffer further abuse in later life. They are likely to suffer deep and extremely traumatic effects as teenagers and adults. They can suffer from multiple personality disorders and bouts of alcohol consumption to the point of feeling suicidal. They can suffer depression and elation, nervous breakdowns and long periods spent in self-imposed isolation due to a mistrust and disbelief in humanity. They discard friendships and are often unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy. They live most of their lives in a state of fear and no amount of compensation can make restitution to such victims. It can be only a small, but important, recognition that their person has been attacked, abused, battered, brutalised and dehumanised. Their crime was that they were poor.</P>
    <P>These people, who will now have their stories heard, who are now encouraged to reveal their terrible suffering, must have the resources of the courts to bring the perpetrators to justice to compensate for their visiting such vile abuse on them when they were young, innocent and helpless children. For that reason, I congratulate Deputy O'Sullivan and the Labour Party for this initiative.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of compensation claims involving allegations of sexual or physical abuse await hearing in the courts. Fine Gael believes the Government must take steps to put in place a new compensation tribunal before which such claims can be processed in a humane and speedy fashion with legal costs and expenses kept to a minimum. The focus of such a tribunal should not be merely in respect of the State making payments for compensation but should also include claims for compensation for which church authorities and religious orders are liable.</P>
    <P>We call on the Government to commence immediately the process to facilitate the establishment of such a tribunal. The adversarial, costly and time consuming court procedure for civil claims is not appropriate for the victims of child abuse perpetrated in State supervised industrial schools. There is an unanswerable case for <Col N="1035" /> the establishment of a tribunal of compensation for those who, as children, were battered, dehumanised and made victims of sexual abuse</P>
    <P>Child abuse continues today and its levels are increasing, but there is a high level of legislative neglect. Yesterday we learnt of two children in Clare being approached by adults in suspicious circumstances. The Minister informed me that in the period September to December 1998, there were approximately 100 incidences reported to the Garda of suspicious approaches made to children. We need a children's ombudsman, established on a statutory basis, to promote and protect children's rights. Children have a right to feel safe, not to be brutalised and dehumanised. They have a right not to suffer from sexual abuse. They have the right to be treated with the same respect and dignity as every human being. A children's ombudsman would ensure these aims were achieved as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified without reservation on 21 September 1992, accepting its international obligations towards children, states that all signatories shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights accordingly. Given that Ireland ratified the Convention, the Government is obliged to take steps to ensure compliance with the provision to protect and promote children's rights. A children's ombudsman must be a priority.</P>
    <P>Many children live in considerable disadvantage &ndash; children in care, children in legal custody, children who are subject to abuse and neglect, homeless children and children with disabilities. The Government should establish a children's ombudsman as an overall mechanism for the promotion of children's rights.</P>
    <P>We can look at the past, apologise for it and compensate for it, but what happened cannot be undone. We must recognise what happened but we must ensure that it does not happen again in any guise, institutional or otherwise. This is our duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>At its first general meeting in March 1995, the Children's Rights Alliance decided that one of its main concerns would be the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children which it felt would play a significant role in implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child and ensuring that children's rights were protected. Following examination of the first report on the implementation of the convention, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about the lack of an independent monitoring mechanism such as an ombudsman or a children's rights commissioner, accessible to children, for dealing with complaints or violations of rights and to provide remedies for such violations. The committee recommended that the Government should consider positively the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children to further the implementation of the convention in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> Public discourse with children has been minimalist in nature. This is shown by the presence of all the principal players in education at the 1994 National Education Convention with the notable exception of children. The Constitution Review Group, CARI, the Kilkenny incest investigation and the report of the 1995 Kelly Inquiry have all stated that the strong emphasis of the family in the Constitution may, consciously or unconsciously, be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than of children. The constitutional clarification of children's rights would assist in the creation of a positive environment for a statutory office of an ombudsman for children. Consequently, a specific, overt declaration on the rights of children should be inserted into the Constitution. This would involve the amendment of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>An ombudsman for children should be allowed to monitor child protection standards, to promote examples of good practice and to inquire into serious failures of practice. It is essential that the ombudsman is able to take legal action in the event of a public body acting in serious breach of its obligations to children. The children's ombudsman, however, should not become involved in legal proceedings until internal complaints or appeals systems have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>In establishing such an ombudsman, the Government would recognise children's fundamental, political, social, economic and civil rights not yet enshrined in legislation. The ombudsman would be a neutral investigator of children's legitimate problems and complaints. With the freedom, authority and autonomy of the office, the ombudsman should tell it like it is and ought to be, and provide a responsive forum for children's grievances. It should ensure that children are perceived as autonomous with their own special needs and rights.</P>
    <P>By establishing an ombudsman for children, the State will provide a significant institutional medium through which children and young people can be heard and given a conflict free environment during their formative years from birth to voting age. The children's ombudsman should speak for children in the context of Government services, facilitating and accommodating remedies for wrongs inflicted on children. A children's ombudsman would lead the way towards ensuring that what was experienced by the brutalised and dehumanised children in institutions, as outlined in the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme on RTE, would not happen again. If the ombudsman for children is to genuinely promote children's rights, the office must engage in meaningful dialogue with children. This could be facilitated through the use of representative surveys or free hotlines as used by the Norwegian and Swedish ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for the establishment of an ombudsman's office and the Minister's Department has a role to play in that. It should be co-ordinated by the Minister of State <Col N="1037" /> with responsibility for children. I am surprised he is not present for this debate.</P>

      <P>Within the Bill there is a range of complex issues which must be dealt with. No one would suggest child abuse is an isolated issue and everyone will agree with the comprehensive programme which will express society's concern about this matter. The Government's response must take all of the issues involved into account. That is why the Minster has proposed such a comprehensive outline. While all of us want to see the conclusions of the commission, for instance, and the proposals introduced in legislation as soon as possible, it is also important to recognise that we must draw on the best professional advice and experience, be it legal, medical or psychiatric. That process should not just be confined to this jurisdiction. I hope we would not suggest, because clearly it is not the case, that anything other than an immediate response on any specific issue is satisfactory at a time when this issue is a matter of concern to society generally, particularly as most of the cases about which we are concerned have their history and origin in the past, a past which is different from the current relatively enlightened and sensitive attitude to child abuse, be it sexual or physical. For that reason, I welcome the Bill but, as Deputy O'Sullivan would acknowledge, it is focused on one specific aspect. I am sure she, too, would agree with the need for an overall review and to look at some of the provisions in her Bill in that context.</P>
      <P>I want to make two or three general points relating to limitation. The courts have extended the application of the limitation disability to the advantage of a number of litigants. This is not to say that this proves the Bill is unnecessary. My example, Army deafness cases, will not necessarily commend itself to the House but it is the most obvious example because the statute starts to run not only from the date of the injury but, significantly, from the date from which the person complaining of that injury was aware, particularly after taking professional advice, that the injury derived from the negligence or negligent acts of the proposed defendants. Sometimes that has applied rather too generously in the instance of Army deafness. I would be reasonably confident, even if this legislation were not introduced now &ndash; I am not trying to denigrate it by so saying &ndash; that, if issues of this kind came before the courts, if someone brought a complaint and the Statute of Limitations was pleaded formally in the defence, the courts would hold that the statute did not run against the plaintiff not only until the plaintiff could establish that he or she discovered the injury or its consequence at a given time but until he or she was clearly aware that the injury was caused by the negligence or breach of duty of the negligent party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> Of course the statute does not become an issue unless it is formally pleaded in defence. It is not just that the injury occurred but that it was caused by negligence. Therefore, somebody who might be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder might not have been aware that the injury, the post traumatic stress, psychiatric imbalance or mental distress, was caused by negligence. The courts, as they currently interpret matters, would say that until such time as it was reasonable to expect, after professional consultation and advice, that the person was aware of the negligence aspect, the statute would not run against that person. That said, I am not trying to cut across the need for this.</P>
    <P>Clearly this is about compensation because civil actions are literally limited to compensation. Anyone who has practised in the courts in whatever fashion knows well that the wrong of even a physical injury can never fully be redressed. The plaintiff can never reach the stage where he or she would have been had the injury not occurred. Therefore, the only remedy available through the courts, and properly so in this instance, is that of financial compensation. Financial compensation, of itself, is imperfect compensation. In response to those who might suggest tribunals in this instance, there are established guidelines, precedents, judicial determinations and diktats in relation to financial compensation, whether we are talking about a physical or psychiatric disorder.</P>
    <P>The reason we cannot approach this in too simplistic a fashion in terms of financial compensation is as follows. If it emerges, for instance, that the psychiatric disorder, which was caused exclusively by the injury, in this case, child abuse, has not only had an effect on the health of the person injured but also on the capacity of that person to earn a standard of living, one is looking at a new area which involves an assessment by way of actuarial calculation. I am not inviting this but I know well that lawyers would consider this if it appeared that some person was disabled from, for instance, pursuing an education course and getting a university qualification or had to terminate that course of study. I would feel fairly confident that a court would take that into account and say that a calculation must be examined regarding loss of future income or a differential between the person's earning capacity and what it would have been had this injury not occurred. That is just one example where the courts, irrespective of what we think about them, are best equipped because this is not like the case of hepatitis C where injury was caused by one element.</P>
    <P>In addition, one must determine as a matter of fact whether the abuse occurred and what exactly it entailed. I have great sympathy with those who say that the courts may be not the most appropriate place for this but the courts can introduce procedures <i>in camera</i>, adhering to all the proper established practices which would enable evidence to be brought fully and properly before <Col N="1039" /> them, which might not be so easily discharged by a tribunal.</P>
    <P>In this instance, Deputy Neville stated that not only the State but also whoever was responsible should be made amenable. There can be no suggestion that the State should indemnify wrong on every occasion from whatever source. Of course there must be the facility for taking proceedings against the named party, organisation or society responsible. If it is alleged that the State, in one form or another, was in dereliction of duty in not instigating or forcing change, there could be a case. However, in that instance if there is to be a case, even between different institutions, and if the State is involved, one is looking at the apportionment of liability between one party and the other, what is called joint tort. That is a complicated issue which we should be careful not to dismiss when we look at issues of this kind.</P>
    <P>We are talking about injuries which are related to post traumatic stress and matters of that kind. The courts recognise compensation for that already. Many cases involve a bigger element of compensation for psychiatric disorder than for physical injury. That is a matter for the courts to determine having heard the evidence in each case but it is not quite a simple matter. One must determine who was to blame and for what proportion of blame they were responsible. When one looks at the quantum, which is what we are considering here and which is the only issue with which the courts can deal, there are many complex questions involving, in many cases, highly professional advice, be it that of an actuary, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a behavioural scientist etc.</P>
    <P>The question of legal representation of people bringing actions of this kind also arises. In some cases, the plaintiff who suffers from a disability, sues through his or her friend, who should have a close relationship with the plaintiff. There are issues to be looked at in that context. Court decisions are binding and create precedents by which judges are guided. The appeal mechanism, which is so important for litigants, is a very special feature of court procedures and should certainly be left open in this case. This issue is slightly more complex than was initially thought. We are all <i>ad idem</i> on this matter to which the Minister's response is generous and comprehensive.</P>

      <Quest>the circumstances in which his Department authorised Beaumont Hospital to take out a £7 million loan from Allied Irish Bank in 1981; the purpose of the loan; if tenders were sought for the loan; if he has referred the file on the loan to the Attorney General; if so, the reason for this action; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The loan, for a principal of £7 million, was raised in 1981 and was used solely for the new hospital project. The loan arrangements were sanctioned by the Department of Finance in February, 1981. In accordance with the provisions of the Beaumont Hospital Board (Establishment) Order, 1977, consent to raising the loan was given to the hospital by the Minister for Health in March, 1981. The loan was approved by Allied Irish Banks Ltd. to the Beaumont Hospital Board at triple A rates, repayable over a five year period. Approaches were not made to other lending agencies about the loan; the hospital's capital account was held by the Allied Irish Banks Ltd.</P>
      <P>In view of the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal, I recently asked the Attorney General to review the relevant files to establish whether, in his view, the matter should be referred to the tribunal. He has now indicated that while the files reveal nothing to warrant their being sent to the tribunal, it would be prudent to send them, particularly in the light of the request from the tribunal to provide any relevant records. Accordingly, the files relating to the loan have now been sent to the tribunal by my Department.</P>

      <P>I regret that part of my question, which may have thrown some light on this issue, was disallowed but I accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling. We do not have any difficulty with the amount of money raised and totally support the purpose for which it was used. Why was this loan, in particular, referred to the Attorney General? The Minister did not explain that in his reply. Was the loan sanctioned at the time by the then Minister for Finance? Does the Minister agree that this loan was raised shortly after a member of his party received a very generous settlement from the AIB? Even leaving that aside, does the Minister agree that the loan was agreed at a very high interest rate? Why was there no tendering process for this loan as would be the normal practice for Departments? Why were other financial institutions not approached? Who informed the Minister about the loan? Will the Minister publish the Attorney General's advice on the matter? I would like the Minister <Col N="1041" /> to concentrate in his reply on why the details of this loan, in particular, were forwarded to the Attorney General. I have not received a satisfactory explanation for this unusual procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Moriarty tribunal's wide-ranging terms of reference. This issue was brought to my attention by a departmental official. Having spoken to the Secretary General, I referred the matter to the Attorney General as any responsible Minister would do. The Attorney General advised me in the normal way, as outlined in my reply. He indicated that while the files reveal nothing to warrant sending them to the tribunal, it would be prudent to send them, particularly in light of the request from the tribunal to provide any relevant records.</P>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's unsubstantiated suggestion that the interest rates were very high. There was less competition in the financial market in 1981 than there is today. The triple A rate &ndash; the rate for the most credit-worthy borrowers &ndash; was common to the main licensed banks at the time. The suggestion that the rates were excessive at the time is incorrect.</P>
      <P>This matter was brought to my attention. I referred it to the Attorney General who advised me on it. On the face of it, there does not appear to be any problem. If the tribunal wishes to see the file, I have no objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining this significant information. Was it not abnormal practice for this kind of favourable arrangement to be made by the Department with one bank without checking around to see what was the best value for money? The Minister stated that there was not any particular aspect which merited referring the file to the tribunal but that it was being referred anyway. That seems to be somewhat contradictory. Is this the only file or matter which has been referred in this way? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making assertions about a favourable deal having been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a favourable deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest this was a favourable deal. The fact is that in 1981, the triple A rate was the best available rate within the banking system. There was not the same degree of competition within the banking system in 1981 as there is today. Different banks did not have different triple A rates. The same rate applied throughout all banks. To suggest a favourable deal was done on the basis of interest rates is factually incorrect. The Department of Finance has not indicated to me that a tendering process was required for loans in respect of this matter. That was not the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of whether the practice was normal or abnormal, it was the practice in the year in question to seek ways of accessing private <Col N="1042" /> funds for the purpose of ensuring that public capital programmes proceeded. The whole motivation for the Minister of the day was to ensure that Beaumont Hospital was completed. That it was completed was to the benefit of the general running of the Department as it meant that the £40 million public capital programme of that year went towards other projects apart from the construction of Beaumont Hospital. On the basis of these objective criteria, clear benefits accrued both to the hospital and the Department. This procedure was used in 1981 because of the financial constraints under which the Government was operating which, thankfully, were quite different to those which prevail today.</P>
    <P>There is nothing contradictory about the Attorney General's advice. The Attorney General has examined the files and on the evidence in them concluded they contain nothing untoward, based on the practice and the policy at that time. Because of the wide terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal, and the fact that the tribunal has requested the files, I have no problem forwarding them.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify this matter. As I said in my reply, the hospital's capital account was held by the AIB. Beaumont Hospital took out the loan and went to the bank which held the capital account. It was capital expenditure. The Deputy is suggesting, by implication, that there were more competitive deals in existence than was the case in relation to this particular bank. The level of competition in 1981 was far different from now. There were not different triple A rates among the various banks at the time; they all had the same rate. Tendering was not required in this situation. In 1981 a positive decision was taken to ensure we could <Col N="1043" /> access private funds for the purpose of proceeding with a public capital programme in the Department of Health. The requisite evidence in the file confirms that this was done with the consent of the Minister for Health and taken out by the Beaumont Hospital board on foot of established Government policy at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that trainee doctors, along with several groups, were excluded from the provisions of the original working time directive adopted by the European Union in 1993. Following adoption of the 1993 directive, the European Commission embarked on a consultative exercise with the sectors concerned and the member states on how a broadly similar level of protection to that provided by the 1993 directive could be afforded to the excluded groups while taking account of the specific requirements of the industries and services concerned. In the case of doctors, this involved attempting to balance the need for reasonable working hours for doctors while recognising the 24 hour nature of hospital services and the need to guarantee continuity of care for patients.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, we needed a framework which would allow us move from the present position of a maximum working week of 65 hours for junior doctors to the 48 hours contained in the 1993 directive. My Department has been concerned to achieve this in a manner which would not endanger patients and which would not throw the entire medical workforce career structure into chaos by recruiting large numbers of trainee doctors for whom there would be no reasonable prospect of securing career posts. The Deputy will be aware that the future structure of the hospital medical hierarchy is being examined by the Medical Manpower Forum.</P>
      <P>The European Commission published its proposals for an amending directive to the 1993 directive in November 1998. The Commission's proposals have been the subject of discussion in a social questions working group under the aegis of the Labour and Social Affairs Council. A significant number of the member states felt the Commission's proposals were impractical and could not be implemented in the timescale proposed. The German Presidency then had to work on compromise proposals which might be acceptable to a majority of member states. These proposals involved a total transition period of 12 years with a gradual reduction in maximum weekly working hours to 48 hours over the period. The United Kingdom proposed a 13 year transition period to reach the objective. In the interests of securing unanimity at the Council, this proposal was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out that we have progressively reduced hospital doctors' working hours over the years. The 65 hour week was introduced in 1989-90 at considerable cost resulting in the recruitment at the time of more than 400 additional <Col N="1045" /> doctors. The number of junior doctors has continued to grow since then. This growth has resulted in a serious imbalance between the number of these trainee posts and the number of consultant posts.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>I established the Medical Manpower Forum to address this and associated medical manpower issues. The forum is taking full account of the need to reduce working hours in its deliberations. However, we have to be realistic in how we approach this complex problem. I have no objection to doctors working a 48 hour week, but we have to have regard to where we are now. What we have sought from these negotiations is a practical framework to implement the 48 hour week. We now have a set of proposals which will allow us to reduce doctors' hours in an orderly and progressive fashion without jeopardising standards of patient care or damaging young doctors' reasonable career expectations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked to have heard the remainder of the Minister's reply. Will the Minister accept that the decision by the Irish Government to effectively put this issue on the long finger at the Council of Ministers meeting has been a source of bitter disappointment, as described by the doctors themselves? While everybody understands and accepts that there has to be a lead-in period, such a lengthy period will cause risk to patient care that is unacceptable both to the public and to the doctors? In terms of the 65 hour week mentioned by the Minister, does he accept that many junior hospital doctors work more than 100 hours per week &ndash; I have heard of some working 130 hours per week &ndash; and to claim we are dealing with a 65 hour week is erroneous when one considers the position on the ground? Will the Minister comment on what is happening on the ground? </P>
      <P>In relation to the specifics of the agreement, there is a lack of clarity about the definition of &ldquo;working time&rdquo; on-call. The way it is currently phrased in the agreement it is almost inoperable. Will the Minister indicate how he views the measurement of the time doctors work when they are on-call?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this decision was made, we have to be realistic about the way we approach this complex problem. I have no objection to doctors working a 48 hour week but we have to have regard to where we are now. What we have sought from these negotiations is a practical framework to implement the 48 hour week. We must ensure that we do not have a situation where we cannot meet the career expectations of trainee doctors because we have not properly dealt with the balance to which I referred in my reply. The issues are being addressed proactively by the Medical Manpower Forum in this jurisdiction, apart from the question of where the working time directive is going in the future. This <Col N="1046" /> problem has been with us for some time but the previous Administration did not put any effort into addressing it. We are doing that. In practical terms, under the forum framework we are seeking to help to address these issues. There is also the question of the definition of working time. The time spent on call is not counted as working time for the purposes of the directive. At present, Ireland includes time spent on call when calculating working time. However, this assumes that hospitals would be able to establish and maintain clear distinctions between normal working time and time spent on call. Mechanisms would also have to be established to measure time actually spent working when on call. This would be counted as working time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason he has not complied with the Government's commitment to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the circumstances which resulted in haemophiliacs contracting HIV and hepatitis C; if the terms of reference for this tribunal have been agreed with the Irish Haemophilia Society; the issues, if any, which remain outstanding; and when the promised tribunal will be established.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting of 25 May 1999, the Government approved the text of a draft order providing for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to investigate the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. The main issues to be examined by the tribunal are: which products caused, or probably caused, the infection; the role of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, medical consultants and others in product selection; the prevailing state of medical and scientific knowledge; the implementation of a self-sufficiency policy by the BTSB; the selection procedures with regard to manufacturers and fractionators; donor selection, testing and screening; plasma quarantine criteria; viral inactivation procedures; follow-up measures in respect of tracing, offering testing and minimising the risk of infection; the response to the discovery that persons had been infected; the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board; and the supervision of the <Col N="1047" /> NDAB and the BTSB by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The tribunal will also investigate the circumstances of the infection with HIV of the person known as &ldquo;the Kilkenny health worker&rdquo;, following a blood transfusion in July 1985, and the circumstances surrounding the issue of untested platelet concentrate in December 1985, the donor of which was subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive.</P>
      <P>Because of the special position held by the Irish Haemophilia Society in that it represents persons directly affected by the HIV and hepatitis C contamination of blood products, my officials and I have been in consultation with the society in relation to the issues to be examined by the tribunal. It appears that most blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs with hepatitis C and HIV were manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in the USA, some based on blood donated there and some based on blood donated in Ireland and sent for processing. In order to fully investigate the source of the infections, therefore, the IHS felt that the tribunal should, if possible, inquire into the relevant operations of the pharmaceutical companies concerned.</P>
      <P>The proposed terms of reference include a provision which would enable the tribunal to investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant in so far as the tribunal considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so, and considers that the procedures adopted for the purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry, and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the investigation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>The Attorney General and I met representatives of the society and its legal advisers on Friday, 21 May. At that meeting, the IHS indicated that it was satisfied that the proposed terms of reference comprised all the issues which it wished to have examined by the tribunal. The IHS also indicated its support for the provision relating to the international aspect of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>At its meeting of 25 May, the Government also approved the moving of the necessary motion in the Dáil and Seanad to establish the tribunal. I will make arrangements for the moving of the motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal. The Minister will agree that it will deal with one of the worst and saddest health catastrophes in the history of the State. It is sad that 65 people have died, 103 are infected with HIV and 210 with hepatitis C. In view of the alarming situation, a two-year wait was too long before we got to the stage at which the tribunal is being established.</P>

      <P>Much of the agreement had been concluded by Deputy Noonan during his term as Minister. When will the tribunal be established? Can the Minister give a guarantee that it will be established by the end of this session?</P>
      <P>There was a difficulty regarding how one could examine the impact of blood products from outside the State. Is there any means by which we can compel foreign companies to produce documentation or evidence or will we have to rely on their contributions? Compensation was promised to haemophiliacs in 1991. Can the Minister guarantee that this will not be put on the back-burner even though this issue is not part of the tribunal's terms of reference?</P>

      <P>I will not get into the issue of how much work was done on this by the time I took office. A lot of work has been done since to deal adequately with the issue.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a delay. What has been achieved has resulted from detailed discussions. Much legal advice has been sought by others, apart from the State. Very complex legal issues are involved concerning the jurisdictional constraints of setting up a tribunal of inquiry in respect of products manufactured elsewhere, and of the companies who made those products but who are not registered here or who are incorporated in another jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>We have terms of reference which deal with the issues people wanted to deal with in a way which is workable and efficacious. They will allow the tribunal to have a beginning, middle and end so that it can deal with the issues in so far as they can be dealt with to the maximum of our ability. The tribunal has an international dimension which will enable the chairperson to take evidence from outside the jurisdiction if it is considered fit and relevant, and where there are expectations of successfully obtaining information. The issue of compellability does not extend beyond this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group referred to by the Deputy was submitted to the North Eastern Health Board on 26 April 1999. The board has referred it to the Medical Council. The consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist in question is on administrative leave and no caesarean hysterectomies have been carried out at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, since the matter was first brought to the attention of the board last October.</P>
      <P>Since receiving the report, the North Eastern Health Board has taken a number of steps in support of patients who may have been affected by these events. These include a helpline to advise any patient, past or present, on any queries they may have and a comprehensive range of support and counselling services for patients and their families.</P>
      <P>Direct contact has been made by the board with the general practitioners of the patients involved to give them information and advice, and, as a precaution, the North Eastern Health Board has arranged for a systematic look-back of all records of the consultant in question prior to 1992.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board and local hospital management are committed to facilitating health professionals to implement all necessary measures to meet the current requirements for quality assurance. Some improvements have or are being introduced by the hospital. These include revised protocols and procedures within the maternity unit, particularly the delivery suite, to ensure best practice.</P>
      <P>All staff at the hospital are co-operating fully with the North Eastern Health Board in implementing agreed protocols and procedures, including audits of these procedures. The measures also include: new arrangements, commencing in June, for the management of antenatal clinic admission protocols regarding the assessment and discharge of women who are not in labour; a twice-daily reporting system involving consultants and midwifery staff; improvements in the consultative process regarding the management of midwifery and obstetrical care; and the introduction of customer care satisfaction surveys.</P>
      <P>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, has been in public ownership since May 1997. The question of amending the code of ethics that applied when the hospital was in independent ownership does not arise. The ethical code of any medical practitioner is defined by the Medical Council and the law of the land. The clinical care of a patient is solely a matter for the individual consultant concerned. The question of compensation in this case would be a matter for consideration by the relevant bodies acting on behalf of the consultant in question.</P>

      <P>The provision of child health services in schools is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The current service is based on a comprehensive medical examination of selected classes and/or on referrals from schools. In addition, screening for vision and hearing defects in selected classes is routinely undertaken. Services are provided free of charge for all necessary follow-up services for defects discovered at such examinations.</P>
      <P> A number of health boards have phased out school medical examinations as it was considered that these examinations were an inefficient use of resources for a number of reasons. These include better pre-school developmental services; better medical services in hospitals and by general practitioners ensure earlier detection of any problems; heightened general awareness due to ongoing health promotion; better informed parents assist in the early detection of problems. The information provided by the health boards indicates that more than 150,000 children were in receipt of a medical examination and/or audiometric and vision screening tests on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>Issues surrounding child health screening and surveillance had not been examined for 30 years. During this period there was rapid economic, social and health care advances and increased emphasis on quality, effectiveness and value for money in health and social services. Accordingly, a review of child health services is being carried out by the health board chief executive officers and I understand that the report is virtually complete. I look forward to receiving it at an early date. My Department will then consider what improvements should be made in the child health service in the light of the recommendations from the chief executive officers.</P>

      <P>I do not believe in top of the head decisions without talking to the people on the ground. The Deputy might have a different view but that is my view of partnership. Since we are the authors of social partnership it will probably take some time for the Labour Party to learn about it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the school medical examination service is an excellent one? Many sight and hearing defects and other medical problems were detected at an early stage through school examination. Surely it would be prudent to invest more money in that system rather than let medical problems develop which will cost the Department more money to correct at a later stage? Does the Minister have discussions with the Department of Education <Col N="1053" /> and Science about health education in schools to back up the schools medical examination service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>An examination of these issues is being conducted at present and that is near finalisation. The traditional child health services provided by the schools need to be adapted to modern times. Parents have a greater awareness of child health issues than might have been the case 30 or 40 years ago. We have a more educated population and people can use their own initiative. They do not have to wait for the State to ensure that their children have proper sight and hearing tests and so forth.</P>
      <P>We need to examine how to shape the school examination services to greater effect and to make them more focused to deal with the priority issues that must be dealt with. If there is a requirement then for a general health check, it should be available where necessary. However, specific recommendations are required to meet the perceived needs of today rather than tinkering around with a system that was more appropriate 30 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency &ndash; HSEA. The HSEA established a task group in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A HSEA survey of Dublin hospitals showed 448 vacant staff nurse posts on 15 January this year. However, a survey of the same hospitals carried out a week later by the Department revealed a significant reduction in the number of vacant posts, down to 384 on 22 January 1999. A further survey carried out during the week ending 5 February provided an almost identical result. This downward trend is consistent with the increase in the number of nurses applying to An Bord Altranais for registration. The returns indicate there is a difficulty in recruiting nurses for specialist areas such as theatre, intensive care, coronary care, accident and emergency and paediatrics. Health board and voluntary hospitals out<Col N="1054" /> side the Dublin area have indicated they have no difficulty filling permanent nursing posts, but occasional problems arise in recruiting temporary or locum staff to cover sick leave, annual leave and maternity leave.</P>
    <P>A further survey of nursing vacancies in the Dublin area is being undertaken by the HSEA. The results of this survey will be available shortly and will be submitted to the Joint Committee on Health and Children which is considering nursing shortages. Representatives of my Department and the HSEA have been invited to appear before the committee on 17 June next.</P>
    <P>The strength of the economy is also having an impact on the availability of nurses. Nurses have enhanced mobility by virtue of their education, training and skills. In the economic boom, they are much sought after by pharmaceutical and related companies in the private health sector, as well as by commercial concerns in other sectors. Ireland is not in a unique position regarding the shortage of nurses. The United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Pay rates for staff nurses are higher here than in the UK and a number of other European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. An Bord Altranais reported an increase in the number of nurses applying for registration which suggests nurses are returning from abroad. In 1998, the board received 1,400 applications for registration from nurses abroad, compared with 939 in 1996. Conversely, the number of Irish nurses going abroad dropped from 1,079 in 1996 to 850 in 1998.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the task group, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad. In addition, the HSEA is committed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. At present, the only options for permanent employment are full-time work or job-sharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives with family responsibilities back to work. The HSEA recently circulated a discussion document on a revised scheme of working arrangements to the nursing unions. A meeting between the HSEA and the nursing unions to discuss the proposals in the document is expected to take place shortly. This initiative is being undertaken under the programme for partnership.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study nursing needs for coming years and to carry out research on the reasons nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> As regards negotiations with the nursing organisations, the Deputy will be aware the Labour Court recently recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas and who hold special qualifications. The court also accepted that there are grounds for improvements in the pay of ward sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the report of the Commission on Nursing. It recommended that the parties enter into immediate discussions on implementation of that report, with those discussions to be completed by 1 May 1999 at which stage the parties were to report back to the court.</P>
    <P>I announced on 10 February that the Government was prepared to accept those Labour Court recommendations. Discussions between the HSEA and the nursing unions began on 16 February and an intensive programme of talks was agreed. Difficulties arose when the direct discussions got under way on 25 February 1999 and the Labour Court decided to appoint a chairman to preside over the negotiations. Intensive discussions between the parties concluded at the end of March. While progress was made on the new roles envisaged for ward sisters and higher grades, there was no agreement on the pay issues. The chairman of the talks reported back to the Labour Court which met the parties again on 29 and 30 April. Given the complexity of the issues that have been referred back to it, the Labour Court arranged to meet the parties separately. The court met the health service employers on Thursday, 20 May and the nursing unions on Tuesday last. I understand the Labour Court may arrange a further meeting with the health service employers.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept there is a critical situation in the Dublin area and that the figure he has given the House of 384 vacancies indicate a serious problem? Does he also accept the nurses' organisations would say that figure is higher and that there are specific problems with Dublin which have not been mentioned? Everyone knows there are shortages in Europe, but there is a greater problem in Dublin which the Minister did not address in his reply. What does he intend to do about the Dublin region where the difficulties mean nurses are unable to work there, even when they want to, because of the cost of living and the difficulty in obtaining accommodation? What is the Minister doing now rather than waiting for reports to ensure attention is given to this problem, be it a city allowance or whatever?</P>

      <P>I indicated in my reply what is happening now. Specific proposals from the HSEA have been put to the nursing unions to try to encourage more flexible arrangements agreed with the nursing unions for people who want to be employed in the health service as nurses. At <Col N="1056" /> present, they are either full-time or must work in a job sharing capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incorrect to suggest that would not be of assistance. The initiatives agreed in November 1998 to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment of people who were abroad and who have previous nursing experience either at home or abroad, have been of benefit. People have been encouraged to take up places because the conditions of employment have been improved. Other conditions of employment would be improved by the further initiatives devised by the HSEA.</P>
      <P>The nursing shortage issue has been with us for some time. We took some initiatives to address it in 1998 and are taking more now to address it further. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing in a radio interview gave an excellent outline of the Government's role in trying to deal with other issues affecting nursing, such as housing.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a critical shortage of nurses, that one of the problems is that school leavers are no longer attracted to the nursing profession because of the almost unbearable working conditions in many hospitals and lack of opportunities for promotion and that the shortage is not confined to Dublin but is throughout the country? Is the Minister aware that nurses are not employed in many hospitals on a permanent basis, that health boards employ nurses for up to 20 years on a temporary basis and that this is contributing to the shortage of people in the profession? What will he do to encourage young people to take up nursing as a profession?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the non-pay issues she outlined are of equal, if not more, importance than other issues which arise. The Commission on Nursing, which set out to bring about structural improvements and reform of the nursing and midwifery sector, indicated that by the number of recommendations it made. However, its recommendations regarding pre-registration training, continuing education, the need to recognise specialisation and the agreement of Government to recognise that and improve pay rates for those who have specialisations are all issues upon which there is agreement and on which I would like to proceed. At present, sole attention is being paid to three pay recommendations which are before the Labour Court. As I outlined in my reply, there is no agreement regarding the pay issues. However, there are many other matters which have been agreed and on which much work has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's statement that there is a severe shortage of nurses outside Dublin is not upheld by the facts based on the surveys conducted by <Col N="1057" /> the Department and the HSEA. There is an acknowledgement that there is a problem in Dublin and the HSEA has devised specific initiatives about which discussions are now taking place with the nursing unions to try to address that in the short-term. There is also the commitment from me to increase the numbers of places in nursing training should that be required, especially in the psychiatric and mental handicap areas where we have provided marketing initiatives which have been successful to the point where there are now six people applying for every nursing post available in those areas.</P>

I assure the Deputy that significant funds and resources are being allocated to ensure that the BTSB reaches the highest standard in terms of best practice in this area. That development is in the best interests of the health service in general as well as those of the BTSB.</P>
      <P>Testing and screening programmes are ongoing. The BTSB has been advertising in foreign journals and newspapers to ensure that the greatest amount of information possible is made available to the cohort of people it is trying to encourage to come forward for testing, not only those living in Ireland but also to those who migrated or emigrated since the contamination phase. These people must be notified and encouraged to submit to whatever screening or testing is appropriate to their circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is almost 20 years in existence. There is no doubt that there have been significant changes in the practice of medicine, the public expectations of the profession and the confidence in the profession to regulate itself. There have also been significant developments in case law covering the safeguards required when a regulatory body proposes to take action which may affect the ability of an individual to earn his livelihood. The council has been able to incorporate changes flowing from these developments in its procedures. The council has also had the benefit of its own experience in handling difficult and complex cases which the framers of the 1978 Act could not have envisaged. It must be acknowledged that the extent to which <Col N="1059" /> the council can amend its procedures is constrained by the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>During previous discussions with the council and other interested bodies a number of proposed changes emerged, many of which will be non-controversial and will easily be incorporated in a new Bill. A number of areas which need to be changed are as follows: registration, fitness to practice, establishment of a health committee, membership of the council, and the role of the Minister. The council has also brought forward discussion documents in relation to the following items: reform of the intern year, health procedures and competence assurance standards. The areas covered by the latter two discussion papers were not addressed in earlier discussions with interest groups and will require further consultation and study before they can be developed into legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>I would like to be in a position to circulate draft heads of a Bill this year. However, I will have to prioritise these proposals against other items in the legislative programme as well as their relative priority <i>vis-à-vis</i> a new nurses Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Department provide guidelines to govern the recruitment of medical personnel? Is there a mechanism to check whether all of those employed in the medical profession are members of the IMO? In instances where medical practitioners worked abroad for a number of years, would it not be better to ensure that, before they take up employment on return to Ireland, these people should be obliged to supply evidence of their good standing? We must ensure that people can have confidence in the abilities of and standards reached by medical practitioners.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to competence assurance standards and stated that the Irish Medical Council, to its credit &ndash; I do not often praise the medical council but I will in this instance &ndash; came forward with proposals and has invested an enormous amount of work in dealing with the difficult issue of ensuring good standards among members of the profession. Does the Minister accept that this should form part of the legislation, that the council has done a great deal of work on it and that the Department should show some goodwill in attempting to include it in the Bill? Does he agree that this is an opportunity which should not be missed? As Deputy Ahearn stated, there is enough evidence to give rise to concerns if this matter is not addressed.</P>
      <P>In January the Minister stated that legislation dealing with medical indemnity may be forthcoming. Will the Bill include provisions to cover that matter?</P>

      <P>No, that is a separate issue. With regard to the competence assurance standards, I met a deputation from the Medical Council recently and we discussed this matter in some detail. The reply I gave is intended to indicate that we would like to incorporate such standards into new legislation but that more work needs to be done because they were only recently introduced to the discussions taking place on the amendment of the Medical Practitioners Act. I agree that the medical council has done a great deal of work on this matter and I have been impressed by its efforts.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of public concern about genetically modified foodstuffs. I assure the Deputy that I am keeping this issue under continuing review and am determined to ensure that public health and the rights of the consumer are fully protected.</P>
      <P>The regulation governing placing on the market a genetically modified food provides adequate protection to consumers. Regulation 258/97, concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients, provides for a pre-market approval system for novel foods, including genetically modified foods, throughout the European Union. A product consisting of or containing a genetically modified organism cannot be authorised for marketing in the European Union without first having undergone an appropriate safety assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sub-committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland advises my Department on an ongoing basis on issues in the area of genetically modified <Col N="1061" /> foods and acts as a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. This committee keeps developments in GMOs under regular review and it acts as the assessment body for applications made under Regulation 258/97. Applications are assessed on a case by case basis and take into account the implications for public health of the consumption of such food. This sub-committee has recently published a report entitled &ldquo;Food Safety and Genetically Modified Foods&rdquo; and, in its opinion, the genetically modified food ingredients currently on the market in Ireland are as safe as their traditional counterparts.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, last August, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published a consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment. I understand the Minister is currently in the final stages of consultation on this paper. In addition to this, an inter-departmental working group on GMOs, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been established with a view to reporting with a co-ordinated overall Government position as soon as possible. The group is comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Agriculture and Food, the Environment and Local Government and a representative of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. I await the outcome of both initiatives with interest.</P>

Nobody is in a position to guarantee there are no dangers in relation to food safety. Will the Minister accept that major concerns have been expressed by the British Medical Association, a body to which I always pay heed? Will he agree sufficient concern has been expressed because already we have on our shelves genetically modified foods which people are not aware they are buying? Will he state clearly that it is important to have our own research facilities?</P>

      <P>The National Food Safety Authority of Ireland has highly competent and scientific people on it. It has scientific committees and specialist scientific committees which look at various areas of concern as they see it. The National Food Safety Authority is working well. I thank Dr. Wall for the work he does and bringing into the public domain many of these issues in an understandable and consumer friendly way. Too often we see the transcription of reports from scientific journals to daily newspapers in a way which does not give credit to the scientific issues involved. This issue is being studied in detail by various Departments, an interdepartmental group and by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in respect of GMOs and the <Col N="1062" /> environment. Given that the consultative process is coming to completion we can get some informed and balanced opinion as to the present position. The National Food Safety Authority has indicated in its report that those products on the market are as safe as their traditional counterparts.</P>

That is a fact and we all know it. Will the Minister accept that extreme caution is needed in relation to these developments and that people should be clearly advised and informed what they are buying and eating?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the proposed White Paper will represent the first comprehensive policy statement regarding the operation of the Irish private health insurance system. It has involved looking at the whole regulatory framework, the restructuring of the VHI, legislative arrangements and our responsibilities under EU directives to facilitate the operation of a competitive market. This has entailed a significant amount of research, analysis and work of considerable complexity. There has also been extensive consultation with the range of interests <Col N="1063" /> involved in private health insurance and private health care provision. Although 15 May 1998 was the latest date set for the presentation of submissions on the White Paper, my Department accepted a number after that date and has had discussions with interested parties up to recently.</P>
      <P>The position regarding publication of the White Paper is that drafting has now been completed and formal consultations with other Departments, prior to its submission to Government, are in progress. Subject to the conclusion of this process, I hope to be in a position to bring the White Paper to Government in June. At that stage it will be a matter for Government to decide its position on the proposals being put forward and on publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that assurance. We have been waiting a long time for what is a very important White Paper. Will it deal with access to hospitals? Is the Minister aware that 44 per cent of people are in private health insurance schemes and that one of the main reasons they enter these schemes is to access hospital beds? Will the White Paper deal with the accessing of beds as a result of having private health insurance ahead of public patients, or will it be excluded from it altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper will deal with the issues that relate specifically to the private medical insurance system as it operates in Ireland. We need a more competitive system, one that has a modern regulatory framework, one that will enhance competition and which will ensure the core values of private health care are enshrined in any new set up which includes community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. It also involved looking at the restructuring of the VHI and its subscribers to avoid the prospect of inexorable increases in premia because of medical inflation and other factors, such as the impact of technology on modern medicine, etc.</P>
      <P>Another issue in the health care system and one which the Government is addressing to a far greater extent than any of its predecessors is the need to improve public capital programmes in the public hospital system. This is precisely what we have been doing. Over the next three years £525 million will go into the public hospital system by way of a capital programme, the most intensive hospital investment programme in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>We need to address all the issues. What the White Paper is about is reforming the VHI and the private health care systems so that there is a competitive system for the future that will give choice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the Supreme Court attributed the disability of an individual to Trivax vaccine which he had received which came from batch 3741, manufactured in 1968. My Department has been in correspondence with the company in question to seek details of this and certain other batches of Trivax vaccine produced in the late 1960s and this correspondence is continuing. As I have already indicated, the company has stated that the results of all tests, mandatory and otherwise, together with expert advice which the company had sought, indicate that no other batch gave rise to the same level of potential concern as batch 3741. My Department will consider any additional information which the company can provide and whether this enables any conclusions to be drawn about the particular vaccine batches concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the information received from the health boards in relation to those individuals identified as having received vaccine produced from batch 3741.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister stand over the statement that no other batch gave rise to the same level of potential concern when during the Best case it was known that batch 3732 was 16 times stronger than the British standard at that time, that 14 batches which were released between 1969 and 1970 never had the mouse weight gain test which was a standard test at that time? Will he explain why there was such an increase in the adverse reactions between 1969 and 1970 following the release of those 14 batches, and how can he stand over the statement that no other batch caused the same level of potential concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised this matter on the Adjournment on 19 May last. We do not know if any of batch No. 3732 was distributed in Ireland and we do not have information on the lot numbers made from it. The statement attributed to Mr. Knight in the Best case appears to be in the realms of speculation. His view that there might have been as many as 100 batches of <Col N="1065" /> high potency does not appear to be substantiated. The Department has written again to Glaxo Wellcome asking for any information available on batch No. 3732.</P>
      <P>In relation to the report of severe reactions, the Deputy said that the Eastern Health Board official responsible for the administration of vaccine in the region obviously believed that the reactions gave rise to the same level of potential concern as batch 3741. The significance of batch No. 3741 only came to notice during the Best case, which was 15 years later. Therefore, the person referred to in the Eastern Health Board could not have had the belief the Deputy ascribes to him. The reactions experienced by the vaccine recipients in 1973 were never officially categorised as serious or non-serious as it appears that few, if any, were reported at the time to the National Drugs Advisory Board which has a system of classification of the adverse reactions notified to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Department not follow up the 14 batches and the toxic batch No. 3732? Why has it taken until now for the Department to contact the Wellcome Foundation? This information became available during the Kenneth Best case in 1992. It has taken seven years for the Department to contact Wellcome for the relevant information. Does the Minister accept that Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton at that time described the company as negligent and criticised its quality control procedures? This issue raises questions.</P>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 52, how many children have had severe reactions from batch No. 3741? Has this been checked by the various health boards? What is the reason for the delay in contacting the parents of these children to let them know that they received batch No. 3741?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked why this matter has been ongoing for so long. However, he will be aware that I am the first Minister who has made any progress on it in terms of getting information about it. I can only deal with the information that becomes available. I cannot deal in the realms of speculation. I reiterate that we do not know if any of batch No. 3732 was distributed in Ireland. We do not have that information. Correspondence about that batch is continuing with the pharmaceutical company concerned. Our inquires and attempts to glean further information, if it is available, are not concluded. We are currently considering what needs to be done in relation to batch No. 3741. My information is that approximately 188,000 children were born between 1969 and 1971, half of whom received the vaccine. The issue is whether a general statement needs to be made and those considerations are being dealt with in the Department at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There were 14 batches, not 14 lot numbers. Some of the 14 batches were definitely distributed and administered in Ireland because they were the only batches produced at that time. Does the Minister agree this raises concerns because they did not undergo a standard test which was in place at that time? This test was approved in the United States and recommended by the World Health Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case, but the issue is what documentary evidence is available to suggest that there is a direct relationship between a vaccine and subsequent brain damage. This is the issue in each case. In the Best case, no reason for the brain damage other than the vaccine could be found. The batch number was obtained and from that the Bests were able to prove to the satisfaction of the court that there was negligence on the part of the pharmaceutical company.</P>
      <P>The dearth of documentary evidence is a major issue in any legal matter. I am trying to follow all avenues which I have been asked to follow in relation to these matters. However, ultimately, I cannot close the circle for everybody. The line of evidence must be available to people. I have met people who have children who are brain damaged and it is very sad. However, I can only do what is possible, which is to get as much information for them as I can, and I am endeavouring to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not routinely collect information on waiting times for non-emergency x-rays. The delivery of radiology services is a matter for local hospital management in the context of the overall delivery of services within available resources. As with all services, priority in the delivery of radiology services is given to emergency cases. Non-emergency cases would be dealt with as quickly as possible taking account of clinical need as identified by the referring practitioner. As a result of varying demands in services arising from emergency work and the varying caseload presenting, waiting times for non-emergency radiology work would vary considerably between individual hospitals and cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am attaching major priority to addressing waiting times generally. A comprehensive review of the problem of <Col N="1067" /> waiting lists and waiting times has been undertaken by a review group established by me and work is under way on giving effect to the wide-ranging recommendations that emerged from that review. A key issue being addressed by each agency arising from the Department's circular is the improved management of outpatient departments and improved organisation and management processes in acute hospitals, designed to reduce both waiting lists and waiting times, including radiological procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is unacceptable that a person must wait up to three and a half months for an x-ray in St. James's Hospital? If the person goes to Tallaght Hospital, he or she must wait two and a half months for an x-ray. If he or she goes to Beaumont Hospital, he or she must wait between one and a half and two months. If a person goes to the North-Western Health Board, the South Infirmary in Cork or the Eastern Health Board, he or she must wait on average one month for a basic x-ray. Does the Minister agree this is unacceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is acceptable depends on the clinical needs of the patient. There is not a demand led scheme with regard to non-emergency x-rays. The referring practitioner indicates to the radiologist concerned the urgency of the case, and all emergency cases or cases which require to be taken immediately for medical reasons are taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the distress and anxiety caused to many patients by the delays? In many instances it is not possible to decide whether a case is an emergency until an x-ray is taken. Is the Minister aware of what is happening in health board areas? For example, is he happy with the situation in the South-Eastern Health Board area? A new x-ray room was provided last Christmas in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel with up to date equipment and modern technology. However, there are no staff to operate it. The equipment is lying idle while patients are waiting in the corridors to use an inefficient x-ray service. Is the Minister satisfied with that type of management by health boards or is he aware of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to discuss this legislation. It is a great change and it is extraordinary that we have had to introduce such a Bill. I commend Deputy O'Sullivan for bringing this forward. It is a great achievement early in her political life, having been returned in a by-election, to have her Bill adopted by the Government and it is a tribute to her concern in this area.</P>
      <P>We are going through a difficult and traumatic period. Revelations have emerged in the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; documentary series and elsewhere concerning the duty of care which religious orders were obliged to uphold but clearly did not. This was in respect of vulnerable people under their care. People are finding it hard to deal with this terrible matter. It is a divisive, emotional and difficult issue. The Minister and Deputy O'Sullivan are to be commended for bringing this forward so that people who abused young boys and girls many years ago can be prosecuted and pursued through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a reminder of the difficulties in this area when I attended a recent political fund raising event in Shelbourne Park greyhound track. A <Col N="1069" /> gentleman approached me, asked if I was a TD and challenged me as to what I was doing about these issues. He did not mention the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programmes but he challenged me in an aggressive manner. One gets defensive when put in such a position. I guessed from the conversation that there was something on this man's mind. I said I would be delighted to take up the matter with the Minister and tried to reassure him that the Government was taking measures to right the wrongs done many years ago but he was not impressed and did not think the Government was doing enough. It was hard to convince him that things were being done. Our conversation lasted about 10 minutes but such was this man's traumatic experience at the hands of one religious order that he found it hugely difficult to tell me that he had been in this position. He had not been sexually abused but he had been horribly physically abused. He had been a member of what was something of a national institution, the Artane Boys Band. It is ironic and dreadful that while that band was playing at Croke Park such awful things were happening in Artane.</P>
    <P>I am glad this legislation is coming forward and the Government is taking all the steps needed to ensure that people who went through the industrial schools get the justice which they richly deserved. It is difficult for Irish people to deal with this because, whether we like it or not, there was extensive church control of Irish society at that time, a virtual moral monopoly. It appears the whole society colluded in the mistreatment of the unfortunate individuals placed in orphanages. The members of the religious orders were not always uncaring but in a great many cases they were. We should fully acknowledge this collusion, which was not under duress. It was not spiteful collusion but those were the times. We will have to revisit this matter and examine it carefully.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science are to be congratulated for making the public apology but that is not enough in this area. The man I met in Shelbourne Park will want much more than that, more even than a commission to investigate. The people affected will seek compensation and they will be right to do so. I hope the Government addresses this in an up front manner. There are many people with painful memories, who have suffered and feel that nothing was done for them for years. In some cases they tried to raise these allegations at various points in the past 30 years or so and that led to even more frustration. They made the complaints and because society had colluded in the process it refused to accept that this could possibly have happened. When allegations were made of child abuse by religious or non-religious people who were involved in the care of those children, the defining feature has been denial.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a humane, proper and positive response to what has been played out in the newspapers and other media concerning sexual and other abuse. We must move forward while <Col N="1070" /> having regard to the dignity of the individuals who were treated this way. It is not an accident that the people mistreated in the industrial schools were vulnerable in that society or powerless and from a background which did not give them influence. They had been abandoned and were at the mercy of the State. Unfortunately it let them down, and it will have to pay for that because it is not right that people should have those painful and horrible memories. Justice can and will be done.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for what he has done and commend Deputy O'Sullivan for her courage in introducing the Bill. I am sure she will make a great impact in the future and I hope she will be a Minister some day and bring forward more legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and all those who contributed to the debate. I am in the somewhat unusual position of responding to a Second Stage debate on a Bill but not being a Minister or Minister of State. I will endeavour to address the issues but some of them, particularly those raised by Deputy Higgins and Deputy Neville, would be better dealt with by the Minister, such as the register of sex offenders, mandatory reporting, an ombudsman for children, and the recommendations of the reports on the Kilkenny incest, Kelly Fitzgerald and Madonna House cases.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his civil servants for his offer of assistance and co-operation. We wish to proceed by consensus as far as possible, although there will not be full agreement on one area.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested there may not be clarity in the Bill on the issue of retrospection. There is a need for absolute clarity here and I would be happy to consider this matter with him and his officials. The question of the words &ldquo;emotional and mental&rdquo;<i>versus</i>&ldquo;psychological&rdquo; is not a point of principle and can be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>I interpret the wording on legal disability in the way I intended it to mean. The Minister suggested it may have a broader meaning and may include areas besides physical and sexual abuse. This needs to be looked at, although I believe the Bill is adequate in that regard.</P>
      <P>The main area of disagreement between this side of the House and the Minister concerns the incision of all physical abuse and not just sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is also physical abuse. The Government proposes referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission. However, I am concerned that delays in addressing the issue of physical as opposed to sexual abuse would indicate that one is more significant than the other. Serious physical abuse can have all the damaging consequences that sexual abuse gives rise to, for example, with regard to a person's emotional capacity to get over the abuse and to be able to take a case. Given this, I believe the Bill should cover physical abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> There is widespread agreement on the need to address this legislation in a comprehensive manner. However, we on this side of the House believe that a greater degree of urgency is required in addressing some of the matters raised. We are all agreed on complimenting those who have displayed so much courage in speaking out. Deputy Conor Lenihan referred to one individual in that regard. When one describes an individual case one realises how much courage it takes and how difficult it must be for people to expose the terrible things that happened to them as children. I am sure many more have been unable to do this and that they are being somehow assisted by those with the courage to speak out. We cannot under-estimate the importance of the step taken by those who have spoken out and who are willing to tell things about themselves that none of us would like to have to talk about.</P>
    <P>A number of the points raised by Deputy Jim Higgins are more proper for the Minister to comment on. He said the prison system only had the facilities to deal with ten sexual abusers whereas there are approximately 280 offenders. Like him, I believe this issue must be addressed immediately. The only way we will deal with it is by providing treatment to offenders. At least one of the people who appeared on the programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; admitted to having offended because he effectively knew no better. Children brought up in an atmosphere of sexual abuse sometimes believe it is the normal thing to do. While there are offenders in prison who may not have had that experience, there is an onus on us to offer treatment in all cases where there is any possibility that an offender might benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins's description of the hypocrisy of those who, for many years, preached one thing and practised another needs to be exposed. I welcome his support and the support of Deputy Neville on the question of physical abuse.</P>
    <P>The question of records has not received much public attention. Many people want to obtain information on their past. It should be made available to the commission, both in the interests of the individuals concerned and in the common interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville has strong views on the need for an ombudsman for children and has studied the matter. He illustrated very well how such a role would be fulfilled and how it would dovetail with the other aspects of the issue. He also referred to imminent cases and the importance of ensuring that we enact the Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to a number of the legal aspects and suggested that the courts might have dealt with the matter. However, as legislators we should not leave it to the courts; we have a duty to deal with these pressing issues. We will not know if the courts would have addressed matters by way of legal precedent and decision. It is better if we deal with them in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> On the question of whether matters should be dealt with by a tribunal or through the courts, Deputy O'Kennedy made important points on precedent, the ability to appeal and the complexity of the kind of compensation a person may seek. The establishment of a tribunal would not obviate a person's right to go to court as well or instead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan provided a good and graphic account of how an individual he met responded to the abuse he had suffered as a child and how strongly such people feel about the importance of us as legislators taking the issue seriously and dealing with it comprehensively.</P>
    <P>I thank all who took part in the debate. We are in agreement on a variety of aspects of this legislation, albeit not on one aspect. I look forward to Committee Stage. I am proud the Government has accepted a Bill I presented to the House and I look forward to co-operating with the Minister, his officials and the rest of the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of both sides of the House fully recognise the difficult and challenging job of our national fire service. It is a task carried out with unswerving commitment by almost 3,000 men and women throughout the country. We all recognise the excellent job fire fighters do in our name. It is right and proper that their commitment to the safety of this country is regularly appreciated.</P>
      <P>The appalling condition of fire brigades and their appliances is, therefore, a matter of humiliation to both the fire service and the Dáil. This view was articulated recently by personnel in the fire service who are genuinely concerned about the lack of investment. Those of us who have responsibility to vote moneys for this essential service should be alarmed and concerned about the views expressed by firefighters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the service ultimately comes under the direction of local authorities, capital investment in the fleet is the direct responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I wish to refer to the matter of that <Col N="1073" /> responsibility. Will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government respond immediately to the widespread concern in the fire service concerning the lack of capital investment in the fleet? </P>
    <P>I was shocked to discover we spend such a small percentage of GDP on the fire service. The figure of 0.02 per cent of GDP represents a fraction of expenditure in comparison to other EU countries. Given that the number of fires reported over the past 20 years has increased by more than 58 per cent, from a public safety perspective it is inexcusable that national expenditure on this most vital area stands at such a low level. Ireland has one of the highest rates of fires in the world &ndash; we have more fires per head of population than Germany, France or the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Last year the Chief Fire Officers' Association published results of a survey into the capital needs of the fire service for the next 15 years and its conclusions are stark. A large proportion of front-line vehicles are second hand and the condition of many fire stations is not adequate from a public health and safety viewpoint. It was estimated that capital requirements for the service over the next ten years to update the fleet of fire engines and improve appliances is in the order of £27.6 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister has direct responsibility for capital expenditure in this area. When will his Department respond to the needs of the fire service? I am particularly concerned abut the position in the Dublin region. The Minister's tentative proposals for the introduction of a new flexible manning system are opposed by large sections of people employed directly in the fire service in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A senior fire brigade officer was quoted in a recent press report as saying &ldquo;Dublin is a tinder-box just waiting to go up&rdquo;. There is genuine concern in the service that the massive growth in the population in the city over the past ten years has not been fully recognised in terms of providing an adequate fire service to meet the city's demands. The underfunding which has taken place in the fire service needs to be radically altered by the Government. It is inexplicable that the necessary commitment of resources to this essential service could be put on the long figure by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for raising this important matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond to this matter and he asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a fire service is the responsibility of the local fire authorities in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981. The day to day costs of running the fire service, about £75 million according to <Col N="1074" /> the 1997 returns, are met by the local fire authorities from local sources of income.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government provides capital grants towards certain expenditure incurred by fire authorities in the provision of fire station projects, fire fighting appliances and emergency and rescue equipment, including communications equipment. The total capital provided in the Department's Vote in 1999 for the fire service is £6.872 million. This is an increase of £1.839 million or 37 per cent over the original 1998 allocation of £5.033 million and is the highest since 1984.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1980s successive Governments have shown a strong commitment to capital investment in the fire service. Investment in the period since 1980 amounts to nearly £100 million and this has resulted in major improvements. Almost 100 new or improved fire station projects have been completed, approximately 350 fire appliances have been purchased, better training facilities have been made available and modern emergency and rescue equipment provided.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in the fire services capital programme in recent years is the computer aided mobilisation project, known as CAMP, which is being implemented on a phased basis nationally. Three mobilisation and communications centres in Limerick, Dublin and Castlebar, to handle all fire brigade emergency calls and some health board ambulance calls, are being developed to cover the country on a regional basis. The centres will provide fire authorities with an efficient and reliable mobilisation and communications system.</P>
    <P>This year it is expected that about six fire station projects will be completed and that work will commence on a further eight projects. About 12 new fire fighting appliances are expected to be delivered and fire authorities will be given approval to invite tenders for a significant number of new appliances on a phased basis during the year; the first batch of five are now being released. In addition, the CAMP project will be progressed significantly.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the level of improvements in the fire services infrastructure since 1980, the needs of the fire service must be balanced against demands from other services for the capital funds available generally. However, in the context of the year 2000 Estimates the Minister will ensure that an appropriate level of funding is made available to enable a fire services capital programme commensurate with needs to be put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It has come to my attention that a group describing themselves as &ldquo;The Dublin Cumann of the IRSP&rdquo; recently issued a threatening notice to residents of an inner city flats complex. The notice threatened that those <Col N="1075" /> involved in &ldquo;drug dealing and abuse&rdquo; will be referred to &ldquo;the local committee and could face notice to leave the main flats complex as a result&rdquo;. This follows a similar notice issued by a group with a different so-called republican connection in another part of the same constituency.</P>
      <P>There can be no republics within this Republic and those who appoint themselves judge, jury and executioner are seeking to provide a cure which is worse than the disease. The Government should do two things to address this matter, it should bring to account those who seek to put themselves in the place of the law and the democratic institutions of the State and, equally important, it should provide the Garda and Dublin Corporation with the necessary estate management resources to ensure that any drug dealing or anti-social behaviour is effectively counteracted.</P>
      <P>I welcome the significant achievements of Dublin Corporation in the estate management area. It is making real efforts and it is to be supported and congratulated on that. The Government should support Dublin Corporation by making whatever resources are necessary to maintain the momentum. I salute those in Dublin Corporation's housing department who are bringing this about.</P>
      <P>In the flats complex to which this notice refers, a community relations garda already co-operates closely with residents and I welcome that development. This garda was viciously attacked in the same flats complex some time ago, but he heroically continues to do his work there. He is much admired by the local people and has the support of the community. It is time he and other gardaí like him were given the necessary support and the resources to do their difficult jobs.</P>
      <P>All democrats must abhor attempts by those who have no mandate to muscle in on the administration of justice. As part of the reconciliation process on this island, it would be a good idea to run democracy training programmes for these people. I do not make that suggestion lightly. Whoever sent out this notice, the people who put on balaclavas and call people before committees and the inner city person who put the gun in the mouth of a nine year old &ndash; the wrong nine year old as it happened &ndash; probably think they are doing a good deed and serving some cause. Those people need training in democracy. They should be told they are entering a democratic way of life and they can no longer behave in that way. If there is a problem with the institutions of this State it is the job of this House and the Government, not that of someone whose cure is far worse than the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make it clear that the State has failed people living in these flats complexes. We have allowed what one journalist accurately described as open supermarkets of drugs to operate in these areas. It is not happening to that extent now. Thankfully, we have reached a stage where we are on top of the problem to some extent. However, the <Col N="1076" /> State must not fail those people. I include judges in that. I hope some judges will walk around the inner city, bump into people and wonder how they get by in these flat complexes, so that when they come to administer the law in those areas they will understand the conditions in which these people live and how one thug in one flat complex can make life hell for everybody. Some of those flats complexes are as big as a large village or small town.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to take every possible step to deal with this issue and put the State behind the communities in those areas so no one else has any reason to stand in and fill a vacuum. This is wholly unacceptable and if it gains currency, it will be very difficult to deal with. People will not have an appeals procedure as we understand it in common law if this type of occurrence takes root.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given this opportunity to address the aspect of the drugs problem in the Dublin area raised by Deputy Mitchell. The Government's policy response to the drug problem which, sadly, afflicts our communities, is to tackle it on two fronts, namely supply and demand. On the supply side, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have taken a zero tolerance stand on this issue. The only answer to dealing with the supply of drugs is strong legislation backed by tough law enforcement measures.</P>
      <P>In this context, I am satisfied the legislative response is appropriate and I assure the Deputy that when the need arises the necessary responses will be made. Accordingly, the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, has been enacted and proposes a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. This Act also introduces a range of new measures to prevent the intimidation of witnesses, jurors and their families and provides for a maximum ten year sentence for people convicted of such intimidation.</P>
      <P>In addition, legislation which I introduced in opposition, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, continues to be a vital tool in the armoury of the criminal assets bureau in their sustained quest to deprive known criminals, and others, of the assets acquired from the proceeds of their illegal activities. As the Deputy is aware my recruitment campaign for the Garda is proceeding and the additional manpower resources which will be made available forms a vital element of my strategy to deal with the drugs problem in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of enforcement the Garda Síochána is doing an outstanding job in dealing with the drugs problem both nationally and locally and, in co-operation with the Customs authorities, seized drugs with an estimated street value in excess of £90 million last year. In addition, operations such as Dóchas, Mainstreet and Cleanstreet targeted the very problem at the core of the issue raised <Col N="1077" /> by the Deputy, namely street dealing in the Dublin area. The success of these operations was such that more than £5.6 million worth of illegal drugs were seized and more than10,000 persons were arrested for drug related offences. This is the proof that the Garda Síochána is dealing effectively with this problem and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>However, enforcement measures alone will not ultimately succeed in dealing with the scourge of the drugs problem. The Government's policy of a multi-agency response which brings the communities and the voluntary sector together with the statutory agencies is one which is working well and has given local communities an effective and vital role in dealing with the drugs problem in their own communities. A major element of this multi-agency approach is the co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the local communities both in relation to the National Drugs Strategy <i>via</i> the local drugs task forces and the integrated services project which aims to develop a more focused and co-ordinated response by the statutory agencies to the needs of the communities.</P>
    <P>There are certain elements who see themselves as self-styled protectors of the community. These people have a well established agenda of trying to discredit the lawfully established public agencies and because of their perception of what they are doing, feel that they are immune to the law when they go about their activities. I assure the Deputy that neither I as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or the Garda Síochána are prepared to allow these people to be above the law. There is little doubt that these elements can influence people in these communities and sometimes people can be swept along on a tide of anti-authority sentiment. However, it is my view and the view of the Garda that despite attempts to manipulate them, the vast majority of people in these areas appreciate the work done by the Garda and the other statutory agencies in dealing with the drugs problem and would disassociate themselves from the actions and comments of these people who choose to manipulate the situation for their own sinister reasons.</P>
    <P>The Garda will continue to work in tandem with the local communities and in this context it is proposed to set up a community policing forum in the area to enable an ongoing planned and shared operation involving gardaí, community representatives, interested bodies and political representatives. The forum will facilitate mediation and the provision of information and feedback in a structured way on issues of mistrust and suspicion. This involves a continued proactive and sustained Garda presence. Research will be carried out to determine a suitable model of community policing which will be followed by the development of detailed structures.</P>
    <P>On the notice mentioned by Deputy Gay Mitchell, Fatima Mansions is the most intensively policed complex in the Kevin Street district and local resident groups acknowledge a vast <Col N="1078" /> improvement in the drug problem of the area. I assure the Deputy that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they will keep a close watch on the situation to ensure that these elements will not be allowed to cut across the normal process of the law. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have full confidence in the ability of the Garda Síochána to deal with this particular issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Monday night 24 May, a group of parents gathered in St. Nicholas of Myra national school in Kinsealy to discuss the plight of their children. Some of their children were assessed as having general learning difficulties, others are awaiting assessment and seven have already been assessed as dyslexic and require a special reading class. Only two of these seven children have been offered places &ndash; one in a school in Malahide and the other in Donaghmede. The principal of St. Nicholas of Myra national school contacted both schools but they told her all places in their reading classes are taken.</P>
      <P>St. Nicholas of Myra national school has a shared remedial teacher who is assigned to it for two days one week and three days the next. As the Minister knows well, the children with special learning difficulties need a great deal more than an odd hour with a remedial teacher. The school needs a special reading class. What is more important is that it has a suitable room available. I recently put down a question about the possibility of a unit, similar to that in St. Oliver Plunkett's school in Malahide, for a school in Swords. However, I have heard rumours that this will fall through because accommodation is not available.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at the position of St. Nicholas of Myra national school which has accommodation. Seven children have already been assessed as dyslexic and needing this special help. Twenty seven others are waiting to be assessed as they are failing at their school work. I am not saying all 27 will be assessed as dyslexic. However, there is a strong possibility that one or two will be. The Minister is aware that dyslexia tends to run in families. Very often someone of the current generation does not know he or she may be prone to it because perhaps his or her father, grandfather or grandmother kept it quiet. It was something people did not talk about because they thought being dyslexic meant you were stupid, but we know that is not the case. It is a particular condition which requires special help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to these children. To give a flavour of the letters I received from their parents, one wrote: &ldquo;It would be great if we could have our own unit in Kinsealy, with seven children already needing it and maybe more to come&rdquo;. Another parent wrote about sending a nine year old child, at a cost of £130 for 13 classes, to three sets of classes at a <Col N="1079" /> total cost of £390. Education is supposed to be free for national school children. Another mother wrote:</P>
    <P>I have contacted the Association for Children with Learning Difficulties and have been informed that any workshop or reading class which they may be able to provide are expensive and I am not in a position to pay for these classes. I am the bread winner in my house as my husband is unable to work and is in receipt of an Invalidity Pension.</P>
    <P>We are putting in front of the most needy children the greatest obstacles in the education system. The children who do not have a problem with learning go to school locally. They have access to all the teaching facilities and an excellent service. Unfortunately, we continue to make life hardest for people with special learning difficulties or general learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at this case, particularly as it is proposed to provide a new unit in Swords. If that unit does not go ahead, he has a ready made opportunity to provide such a unit in Kinsealy national school.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin): I thank the Deputy for raising this issue this evening. My Department has recently received an application for a resource teacher to cater for a number of special needs pupils and for the establishment of a reading class in the St. Nicholas of Myra national school. The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special education needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full-time or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs. My Department's inspectorate has been requested to investigate the level of need in the school in question. A decision on this request will be made as <Col N="1080" /> soon as the inspector's report has been received in my Department.</P>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The level and quality of this training is one of the important issues to be addressed by the Review Group on Primary Teacher Training. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teacher posts in the primary system. I recently announced my intention to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September 1999.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>The recent package for special needs children, to which I have already referred, is available to children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia. In addition, I have asked my officials to review current supports, including in-service teacher training, for children with dyslexia. This review will be open to consider the full range of possible supports for the pupils involved.</P>
    <P>We will look at the issue of a special class, although normally special classes deal with children with severe language and communicative difficulties. They normally involve the recruitment of a language therapist, which over the months has proved difficult in certain health board areas where there is a shortage of language therapists.</P>
    <P>If there are many children with special needs in the school, the provision of a resource teacher should be automatic. It is a matter of getting the inspection done properly and processed, but I will look into the matter pertaining to the special class request.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 June 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a very strict regulatory regime which ensures that only competent and properly qualified medical staff can work in this country. No doctor is allowed to practise medicine without being registered in Ireland by the medical council. The council was established under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, and registers doctors who qualify from Irish medical schools. It also registers doctors who have been educated and trained in other jurisdictions before they can practise medicine in Ireland. The medical council has authority to register doctors from other EU member states who have rights to practise here under EU freedom of movement directives. I know the council works closely with registration bodies in other jurisdictions, including the general medical council in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Once properly registered a doctor is entitled to practise here. For those doctors seeking employment in the public hospital system, as for any other prospective employee, it is the responsibility of employing authorities to check references and previous employment histories of candidates prior to employing them. Specifically in relation to hospital consultants, the Department has recently issued a circular to all employing authorities on the need to ensure that these matters are in order prior to consultants taking up duty on either a permanent or locum basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The Local Appointments Commission processes a number of senior medical posts on behalf of the health service employers. Their procedures for hospital consultant posts place the requirement on each candidate to supply three references in advance of the interview stage. For other posts, where the volume of applications would make this procedure prohibitive, the commission carry out these checks on the successful candidate or candidates in advance of making a final recommendation to the employer. Both the Local Appointments Commission and the health service employers agency consider it good recruitment practice to obtain references from new appointees and continue to promulgate this practice among health service employers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case, I advise the Deputy that the Southern Health Board follows a detailed set of procedures when a locum consultant applies for a position: contact is made with the applicant's most recent or current employer requesting a reference; documentary evidence of current registration with the Irish Medical Council is sought; documentary evidence of current membership of a medical defence body is sought; and current work permit, if applicable, is sought.</P>
    <P>The board had not been made aware that the consultant in question had licensing difficulties in another jurisdiction. The procedures outlined above were followed. The medical council has confirmed that at this time the consultant in question is a fully registered medical practitioner. As soon as the allegation was brought to its attention the board sought clarification on the matter with the individual in question and with the council.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is currently being reviewed by my officials. Clearly, fitness to practise is one of the areas which is being examined in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards currently provide 49 high support-special care places for children who are in need of special care or protection. Plans are under way to develop additional places nationally as follows: in the Eastern Health Board area, the construction of a special care unit providing 24 <Col N="1084" /> places at Ballydowd, Lucan commenced in January 1999. It is anticipated that this unit will come on stream in early 2000. Planning of a 24 bed high support unit which will be built at Portrane is at an advanced stage. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready in early 2001. A step-down facility which will ensure efficient use of the existing high support beds by freeing up beds more quickly and a facility which will assist in the provision of interim measures of care pending the coming on stream of the units at Ballydowd and Portrane are being put in place by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board, the North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places, ten of which are additional, on a single campus. A project group has been put in place to develop the proposal. Places being developed in the other boards are as follows: ten high support places and a special secure regional facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board; ten high support places in the South-Eastern Health Board; five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a secure unit for girls in the Southern Health Board. It is estimated that the majority of these places will become available during 1999 and 2000. In addition the development of ten places in the Mid-Western Health Board area and eight places in the Southern Health Board already planned to come on stream in 1999 is proceeding.</P>
    <P>My Department has conveyed approval to proceed with all of these developments and is providing the required funding in 1999. The senior managers resource group comprising representatives from each of the health boards and my Department, established in October 1998, continues to meet at regular intervals to monitor the overall development of the service.</P>

      <P>I have seen reports of the study referred to by the Deputy. It is a matter in the first place for intending travellers to countries where certain infectious diseases are prevalent to familiarise themselves with the general advice on immunisation for travellers to the country concerned. Advice and information is obtainable through general practitioners, health boards, travel health centres, travel agents or the embassy or consulate of the country which it is intended to visit. In addition to the traditional immunisation advice, intending travellers should also consider seeking advice on a range of other issues, for example <Col N="1085" /> whether they are medically fit to travel, what medical provision should be made for individuals with pre-existing illness and what general precautions should be taken in relation to eating, drinking and exposure to a different environment from that to which people are accustomed.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that under the terms of sections 10(1)(e) and 12(1)(b) of the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act, 1995, amongst the information which organisers of package holidays are required to make available to possible consumers is information about health formalities required by national administrations for the journey and the stay.</P>
      <P>My Department publishes material containing general health advice for persons planning to travel abroad and this deals with the risks of infectious disease and the desirability of ensuring that intending travellers to at-risk countries obtain the appropriate vaccinations, as well as some of the other issues to which I have referred. The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is currently reviewing its immunisation guidelines for Ireland and this included an examination of the advice to medical professionals on immunisation for persons travelling abroad. My Department will be arranging for the distribution of the revised guidelines, when completed, to a range of interested parties.</P>

      <Quest>the waiting time for treatment at the mammography centre at the Mater Hospital, Dublin; the steps, if any, being taken to reduce waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13982/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, in Ireland mammography is used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or <Col N="1086" /> concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease. There are 19 diagnostic mammographic units available in Ireland for symptomatic breast cancer patients. Of the 19 units 14 are available outside of Dublin, with at least one unit in each health board area.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. The aim is to lead to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer in asymptomatic women.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, my predecessor gave the go ahead for the introduction of phase I of the national breast screening programme for the target population of women aged 50-64, in the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. There will be two central units located at St. Vincent's hospital and at the Mater Hospital, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the national breast screening board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas. It is expected that the programme will commence in October 1999. My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific difficulties being experienced at the Mater Hospital, the view of the hospital is that increased awareness among women due to the proposed introduction of the national breast screening programme has led to increased requests for screening which in turn have increased the numbers waiting for mammograms. Allied to this is the large number of GP referrals to the Mater Hospital from outside its catchment area. The Mater Hospital has estimated that approximately 88 per cent of its waiting list are from outside Dublin. As I have already mentioned there are 14 units available to meet needs of these patients.</P>
      <P>My Department is very conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. For this reason, I have requested the national cancer forum to undertake a review of symptomatic breast cancer services at national level prior to the commencement of phase I of the national breast screening programme and to report back to my Department as soon as possible in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tandem with this, my Department recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The Department's key concern is to ensure that all women, irrespec<Col N="1087" /> tive of age or where they live have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mammographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensuring that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>

      <P>Under the national cancer strategy, oncology services are being provided at an increasing number of locations throughout the country. Up to the recent past, consultant-based oncology services were confined to a small number of locations, mainly in Dublin. However, the Government has allocated some £19.5 million to a range of cancer services including oncology, and the process of developing consultant-based oncology services nationally is well under way.</P>
      <P>Since the national cancer strategy was initiated, additional consultant medical oncologists, together with appropriate support staff, have been appointed in St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Beaumont Hospital Dublin, the North-Eastern Health Board area and South-Eastern Health Board area. I have provided funding for further consultants in this specialty in the Midland, Mid-Western, North-Western, Southern and Western Health Board areas and work to put these services in place is continuing. The provision of these posts and support staff will ensure that patients with cancer can be treated to the greatest extent possible within their own region, thus considerably reducing the need to travel lengthy distances for treatments.</P>
      <P>Patients with cancer are seen as quickly as possible and it is not normal for to have significant waiting periods before they can be assessed and treated. I am confident that the considerable expansion of oncology services that I have outlined will offer high quality facilities and ensure that all patients are seen without delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 77 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the North-Eastern Health Board received approval from my Department for the appointment of a consultant general surgeon with a sub-specialty in breast and endocrine surgery. In anticipation of the arrival of this consultant, the board purchased mammography equipment for the Cavan site of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. The equipment was delivered at the end of November 1997.</P>
      <P>It is essential that all medical equipment, particularly mammography equipment, is installed in an appropriate location in any hospital setting. Factors such as high quality of service, safety and the needs of patients must be taken into consideration before a suitable location is decided upon. Management and staff at the hospital agreed on the most suitable location, which required structural alterations prior to the installation of the machine.</P>
      <P>As this is highly specialised equipment, the management at the hospital engaged the department of medical physics and bioengineering at St. James's Hospital, Dublin together with its own technical and health and safety experts to ensure that the installation would meet the highest specifications and standards.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast and endocrine surgery is now in place on the Cavan general hospital site. The North-Eastern Health Board has recruited two consultant radiologists who will also have an important input to cancer services. Further training of staff was required in order to ensure that the mammography equipment is operated to the highest standards, and this process is now almost complete. The installation of the mammography equipment is near completion and the North-Eastern Health Board anticipates that the service will be operational shortly.</P>

      <P>The joint committee for specialist training in dentistry, JCSTD, a joint British-Irish body representative of the royal colleges, is the body charged with responsibility for approving post graduate training in dentistry in order to ensure that proper and consistent standards are met between these islands.</P>
      <P>The JCSTD, through the specialist advisory committee in orthodontics and paediatric dentistry recently carried out a visitation to a number of the health board regional orthodontic units. The purpose of this visitation by the SAC was to provide independent assessment of the suitability of the trainees working in the units, the proposed training programmes and the training centres for post graduate training in orthodontics. The outcome of this visitation is awaited.</P>
      <P>Initially it was proposed that the orthodontic unit at St. James' Hospital would be included in the visitation. However, the SAC did not consider it necessary as the committee had visited the unit in the recent past and had already approved a training programme for trainees in the unit. This training programme does not, however, have the agreement of the consultant orthodontist who heads up the unit.</P>
      <P>It is important to the staffing of the regional orthodontic units that suitable post graduate training programmes be available to dentists working in the units and I would welcome the establishment of such programmes with the involvement of the two dental schools. However approval of training programmes is a matter for the JCST and the royal colleges.</P>

      <P>The dental health action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant led orthodontic service. A consultant led service ensures a service of high quality and high treatment levels. Seven of the health boards are now operating a consultant led service.</P>
      <P>Under the action plan there has been an overall improvement in treatment levels and in waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group on the orthodontic services made its report to the chief executive officers of <Col N="1090" /> the health boards. The report of the review group recommended that all health boards use the same severity index to determine need, that resources are provided in this context and that provision of orthodontic treatment should be on the basis of priority need; that all health boards adopt the index of treatment need to prioritise patients for treatment and that appropriate training to develop assessment skills is provided; that the health board dental surgeon refer appropriate patients for assessment at regional orthodontic units through the principal dental surgeon; that orthodontic services, being secondary services should fall within the ambit of responsibility of the acute hospitals manager in each health board; that a steering-co-ordinating group be established in each health board area for dental, orthodontic and oral surgery services; that in the event of additional funding not being available, consideration should be given to the introduction of a system of charges or contributions, means tested in order to increase resources available to enhance the level of service provision; that regional orthodontic units provide courses of continuing education to maintain and upgrade skills and standards; that dental schools continue to be involved in service provision as part of their training programmes in collaboration with relevant health boards. These should be co-ordinated through the regional orthodontic unit in the appropriate health board; that a standard model for costing orthodontic treatment be developed and implemented for each regional unit; that the current policy of having a consultant led service be continued. That each health board have a consultant orthodontist and that the training of consultants in Ireland be facilitated by the regulatory and training bodies; that specialist orthodontists appropriately trained, qualified and registered be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service; that regional orthodontic units be involved with the dental schools in the training of specialists on a rotational basis; that hygienists-auxiliaries be employed in regional orthodontic units to complement the role of the specialists, provided that appropriate training and registration is facilitated; that existing dentists employed in the regional orthodontic units be provided with an opportunity of achieving specialist orthodontist qualification; that the revised structure be introduced and funded on a pilot basis in two boards, initially, in order to assess its effectiveness and value for money; that a system of outcome measurement and audit be implemented in each orthodontic service whether directly provided or by service agreement. The group recommends the peer assessment review system; that post graduate training programmes be reviewed with a view to providing training at both specialist orthodontist and consultant orthodontist levels through collaborative programmes prepared and implemented by the dental schools and regional orthodontic units; that health boards as major providers of orthodontic services, as employers of <Col N="1091" /> orthodontic staff and as partners in training schemes, should in respect of this service seek direct representation on the dental council and the establishment of a co-ordinating body for the education and training of orthodontic professional and support staff; and that the introduction of relevant and integrated information, treatment planning and telemedicine systems be facilitated as appropriate, at each regional orthodontic unit.</P>
    <P>Under existing guidelines for the provision of orthodontic treatment at secondary care level treatment is provided for children in categories A and B. Under the index of treatment need recommended in the report categories range from one &ndash; no need for treatment &ndash; to five  &ndash; greatest need. The report states that there is general agreement that those below category four do not justify treatment at secondary care level. Treatment of all persons in categories five and four would require relaxation of exiting criteria for treatment. I have no current plans to ease the criteria for the provision of treatment but I have instructed my Department to take up with the chief executive officers this issue and other issues arising out of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the concerns of consumers in relation to genetically engineered food.</P>
      <P>My Department is the competent authority in Ireland for Regulation (EC) No 258/97 which came into force in all member states on May 15 1997 and applies to the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients. Food and food ingredients which have not, as of May 15 1997, been used to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall within its scope. The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must be officially approvedauthorised before being placed on the European market. The regulation also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 concerning the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms ensures that the provisions of Regulation 258/97 apply to foods and food ingredients consisting of or derived from GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation <Col N="1092" /> 258/97. These controls provide protection to consumers and I am keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established a GMO and novel foods sub-committee which serves to advise me on issues in this area together with affording a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. This sub-committee has recently published a report entitled Food Safety and Genetically Modified Foods and, in its opinion, the genetically modified food ingredients currently on the market in Ireland are as safe as their traditional counterparts.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for legislation on medicinal products. Great advances in the area of medicines have been brought about as a result of genetic engineering. All medicinal products, including those derived from, containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms, must be licensed in accordance with both national and European legislation before they can be placed on the market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Irish medicines board is the competent authority in Ireland for the licensing of medicinal products in Ireland, under Council Regulation 2309/93, medicinal products developed by specified biotechnological processes are required to be centrally licensed by the European Commission on the advice of the European Agency for the evaluation of medicinal products. The regulation contains specific provisions relating to medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs.</P>

      <Quest>the number of drug addicts being treated through the methadone treatment programme by the Eastern Health Board; the number seeking this treatment on a waiting list; and if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed that the new protocol applicable to methadone treatment is resulting in greater delays in the availability of treatment and a consequent increase in the numbers on the waiting list and a lengthening of the waiting times.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the Misuse of Drugs (supervision of prescription and supply of methadone) Regulations, 1998, which came into operation in October 1998, provided for the establishment of a central treatment list, imposing strict controls over the prescribing and dispensing of methadone. In addition methadone could only be dispensed to patients registered on this list who held a drug treatment card. These regulations were necessary in order to prevent inappropriate prescribing of methadone, which, in some cases, was resulting in its availability on the illicit market.</P>
      <P>Leading up to and following the introduction of the regulations a small number of general practitioners, who prescribed to large numbers of patients did not become involved in the methadone scheme. As a consequence, their patients have had to be accommodated at treatment centres around the Dublin area.  The numbers registered in treatment at the end of August 1998 was 3,371, the numbers registered in treatment has  continued to rise to 3,829 at 17 May 1999. There are now 100 general practitioners and 155 community pharmacists participating in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Methadone is now provided at 40 Eastern Health Board treatment locations, 19 of which were established in 1998, and through general practitioners. During 1998 the health board provided an additional 715 treatment places in its services.  Because of the increased availability of treatment locations, the demand for treatment has increased, causing an increase in the waiting list. The waiting list for treatment at 31 August 1998, prior to the introduction of the methadone regulations was 500. Services for these people could only be provided at five locations.  The current waiting list is 618, but 11 treatment locations now deal with the waiting lists. The board is presently involved in an exercise to validate waiting list figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> The increase in numbers in treatment and the increased participation by general practitioners and community pharmacists demonstrate that the methadone protocol has not contributed to delays in treatment. The demand for treatment continues to grow, however, as treatment facilities continue to be developed. The Eastern Health Board's service plan for 1999 includes the provision of additional treatment locations aimed at eliminating waiting lists and providing treatment to people in their own local area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of local hospital management to roster non-consultant hospital doctors taking into account the nature of the clinical service to be provided. The basic working week of all NCHDs is 39 hours. However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week. The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs. A mechanism has been introduced to monitor and control working hours of NCHDs as part of the revised terms and conditions of the NCHD contract of employment effective from 1 January 1997. The first stage of the mechanism, was introduced on 1 July 1995 and the complete four stage mechanism, to resolve any breach of the Labour Court recommendation has been in place since 1 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that trainee doctors, along with several other groups, were excluded from the provisions of the original working time directive adopted by the EU in 1993. Following adoption of the 1993 directive the European Commission embarked on a consultative exercise with the sectors concerned and the member states on how a broadly similar level of protection to that provided by the 1993 directive, could be afforded to the excluded groups while taking account of the specific requirements of the industries and services concerned. In the case of hospitals this involved attempting to balance the need for reasonable working hours for doctors while recognising the 24 hour nature of hospital services and the need to guarantee continuity of care for patients. In Ireland's case we needed a framework which would allow us to move from our present position of having a maximum working week of 65 hours for junior doctors to the 48 hours contained in the 1993 directive. My Department has been concerned to achieve this in a manner which would not endanger patients and which would not throw the entire medical workforce career structure into chaos by recruiting large numbers of trainee doctors for whom there would be no reasonable prospect of securing career posts. The Deputy will be aware that the future structure of the hospital medical hierarchy <Col N="1096" /> is already being looked at by the medical manpower forum.</P>
    <P>The European Commission published its proposals for an amending directive to the 1993 directive in November 1998. The commission's proposals have been the subject of discussion in a social questions working group under the aegis of the labour and social affairs council. A significant number of the member states felt that the commissions' proposals were impractical and could not be implemented in the timescale proposed. The German Presidency then had to work on compromise proposals which might be acceptable to a majority of the member states. These proposals involved a total transition period of 12 years with a gradual reduction in maximum weekly working hours to 48 hours over the period. The United Kingdom proposed a 13 year transition period to reach the objective. In the interests of securing unanimity at the Council this proposal was accepted.</P>
    <P>I have to point out that we have progressively reduced hospital doctors' working hours over the years. The 65 hour week was introduced in 1989-90 at considerable cost resulting in the recruitment at the time of over 400 additional doctors. The number of junior doctors has continued to grow since then. This growth has resulted in a serious imbalance between the number of these trainee posts and the number of consultant posts. I established the medical manpower forum to address this and associated medical manpower issues. The forum is taking full account of the need to reduce working hours in its deliberations. However, we have to be realistic in how we approach this complex problem. I have no objection to doctors working a 48 hour week. But we have to have regard to where we are now. What we have sought from these negotiations is a practical framework to implement the 48 hour week. I believe that we now have a set of proposals which will allow us to reduce doctors' hours in an orderly and progressive fashion without jeopardising standards of patient care or damaging young doctors' reasonable career expectations.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence, of which I am aware, that the average weekly hours worked by Irish hospital doctors pose a threat to their own health or the health of their patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 50 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Following the report of the Finlay tribunal of inquiry, the BTSB is implementing a wide &ndash; ranging programme of modernisation in order to adapt to emerging developments in transfusion medicine. A number of measures to further improve blood safety are being introduced this year at a cost of approximately £6.8 million. This has resulted in a unit price increase in red cells from £63 to £94. A new IT system is also being introduced at a cost of approximately £4 million. At the Cork centre, the BTSB recently completed the refurbishment of the components processing and compatibility testing laboratory at a cost of over £500,000.</P>
      <P>Transfusion medicine is undergoing rapid change. New technologies and additional safety tests continue to emerge. The BTSB is continually assessing these developments to ensure that its practices are in line with best international standards consistent with efficiency and effectiveness. One such development is PCR testing which is being introduced on the advice of the medical consultants at the board following an evaluation of international best practice. PCR testing is the most sensitive way of detecting viruses in blood donations and requires high grade laboratories, expensive technology and expert technical support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 1998, the board of the BTSB decided that, having regard to international practice, PCR testing at both the Dublin and Cork Centres could not be justified. It was decided, therefore, that PCR testing for all donations would be carried out in the new national headquarters which is currently under construction. The implementation of this decision will involve testing blood samples from donations collected in all parts of the country at the new national headquarters. The proposal which is now being <Col N="1098" /> assessed by the BTSB is whether all serological testing, and not just PCR testing, should be performed at the national headquarters. The board of the BTSB has asked the chief executive officer and the national medical director to prepare a report on the practical implications for patient services of developing a single site for donation testing in Ireland. Among the issues being addressed are: how best to provide a transfusion service in the light of the rapidly changing environment in transfusion medicine; the application of accepted international standards of practice in leading centres and blood services; the achievement of the goal of supplying 100 per cent of blood components on time and without fail; the likelihood of a substantial reduction in the use of blood components given the alternatives to blood transfusion which are currently available on being developed; the concerns of health boards and hospitals, including their concerns about the substantial increase in the costs of BTSB products; the achievement of a service that is efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, the chief executive officer and the national medical director of the BTSB are consulting with international transfusion experts. Consultation is also taking place with BTSB staff, relevant hospitals and blood users to brief them on the emerging developments, fully explain the BTSB's enhanced blood safety programme and address the needs and concerns of medical and scientific staff. A meeting has already taken place with members and staff of the Southern Health Board. The BTSB has advised the Southern Health Board that the BTSB is committed to working with all hospitals to ensure that it meets their blood component needs in a speedy, efficient and cost-effective manner consistent with the essential requirement of blood safety. The BTSB has invited scientific and medical input from hospital consultants in Cork to inform its considerations. The newly appointed chairman of the BTSB has also offered an opportunity to the Southern Health Board to make a presentation. The board of the BTSB will consider the outcome of the current assessment at its meeting in July.</P>
    <P>In response to a number of misleading statements that have appeared in the media recently, I want to assure you that the closure of the BTSB Cork centre is not on the agenda of the BTSB or my Department. All that is being considered is a possible change in one aspect of the Cork operation. There is no suggestion of any change in relation to the other scientific and technical services currently carried out at the Cork centre, such as blood grouping, components processing, compatibility testing and ante-natal screening.</P>
    <P>With regard to claims that patients' lives will be put at risk as a result of the proposed changes in the BTSB Cork centre, the BTSB says that there is no evidence to suggest that life-saving operations in hospitals throughout the country would be affected by having one national testing centre. The BTSB point out that there are many <Col N="1099" /> acute hospitals in the country that are a considerable distance from a blood testing centre and this, of itself, does not pose a threat to patient safety. It has been suggested that the removal of testing operations from the Cork centre would delay the supply of blood components to hospitals in the region. The BTSB reject this and point out that, at any given time, 75 per cent of blood stocks are held by hospitals, with the remainder being stocked at the BTSB facilities in Cork and Dublin. There is no proposal to change this policy.</P>

      <P>The result of the review carried out by Beaumont hospital is that of the 198 slides reviewed, 13 slides which were reported by Claymon as negative are now regarded as positive. Eleven were inadequate/borderline, one was C1N1 and one C1N2. Beaumont hospital has been in contact with the doctors responsible for the 13 patients and has been informed that these doctors are taking appropriate action. A further six discrepant cases were reported as negative by Claymon, more recent follow-up smear results were available. In five of these cases the follow-up smears were negative and one case was classified as C1N3. The patient was referred for colposcopy.</P>
      <P>In relation to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital the results of the review indicate that there is a change in status in one case.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group referred to by the Deputy was submitted to the North-Eastern Health Board on 26 April 1999. The board has referred it to the Medical Council.</P>
      <P>The consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist in question is on administrative leave and no caesarean hysterectomies have been carried out at Our Lady of Lourdes hospital, Drogheda since the matter was first brought to the attention of the board last October.</P>
      <P>Since receiving the report, the North-Eastern Health Board has taken a number of steps in support of patients who may have been affected by these events. These include: a helpline is in place to advise any patient, past or present, on any queries they may have; a comprehensive range of support and counselling and support services is being provided for patients and their families. Direct contact has been made by the board with the general practitioners of the patients involved to give them information and advice; and as a precaution, the North-Eastern Health Board has arranged for a systematic look back of all records of the consultant in question prior to 1992.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board and local hospital management are committed to facilitating and encouraging all health professionals to implement all necessary measures to meet the current requirements for quality assurance. To date the following improvements have been or are being introduced by the Hospital: revised protocols and procedures within the maternity unit, and particularly the delivery suite, to ensure best practice. All staff at the hospital are co-operating fully with the North-Eastern Health Board in implementing agreed protocols and procedures, including audits of these procedures; new arrangements commencing in June for the management of antenatal clinics admission protocols regarding assessment and discharge of women who are not in labour; a twice-daily reporting system involving consultants and midwifery staff; improvements in the consultative process regarding the management of midwifery and obstetrical care; and the introduction of customer care satisfaction surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda has been in public ownership since May 1997. The <Col N="1101" /> question of amending the code of ethics that applied when the hospital was in independent ownership does not arise. The ethical code of any medical practitioner is defined by the Medical Council and the law of the land. The clinical care of a patient is solely a matter for the individual consultant concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of compensation in this case would be a matter for consideration by the relevant bodies acting on behalf of the consultant in question.</P>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board is dealing with certain issues in relation to two other consultants in its area at present. Both cases are under consideration by the Medical Council and I do not wish to comment further on them at this stage.</P>

These reviews are conducted against the background of strategic plans for health services in their areas and in the context of their priorities for the development of their services. In due course they make an application to my Department and to Comhairle na nOspidéal for approval of their proposals. The Deputy will be aware that the comhairle is the statutory body with responsibility for regulating the number and type of hospital consultants.</P>
      <P>The number of hospital consultants has been growing steadily. In 1987 there were 1,095 consultants in the public hospital system. In 1999 there are 1,388. In 1998 an additional 61 consultants were appointed.</P>
      <P>The manner in which hospitals are staffed is presently being examined by the medical manpower forum. The forum is looking at several options and I would prefer to await the outcome of its deliberations before making any further comment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>I again express my sincere condolences to the parents of the baby in question. The circumstances surrounding the baby's death in September 1995 were investigated in detail by the North-Western Health Board. The consultant pathologist at Sligo General hospital concluded that the baby died as a result of a severe intra-uterine infection which occurred between two and four weeks before the birth. These conclusions were supported independently by a consultant pathologist and a neuropathologist at two Dublin hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents of the baby later sought a wider investigation of the general standards at the maternity unit in Sligo General hospital. To establish whether there was a basis for a detailed inquiry, my Department sought and obtained specific details from the North-Western Health Board regarding the operation and performance of the maternity unit. The information, which has been reviewed by the chief medical officer of my Department, indicates that: the maternity unit's peri-natal death rate for the last five years has been in line with the average for all maternity units around the country, and in a number of years it has been lower than the national average. The peri-natal death rate, i.e. number of still births plus deaths in the first seven days of life, expressed per 1,000 live births, is regarded as a prime indicator of the quality and performance of a maternity unit; the hospital's approach to quality assurance and related measures at the hospital is satisfactory. The North-Western Health Board provided my Department with details of ante-natal education, epidural services, neo-natal resuscitation, staff development and training and related areas such as health promotion and colposcopy services; the speciality of obstetrics-gynaecology received a total of just 13 formal complaints in the period 1995-97. This compares with a total of 3,648 births in the hospital during the same period. I understand that these complaints were satisfactorily addressed and involved the <Col N="1103" /> hospital's complaints officer and-or the consultant involved.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that a further investigation of the operation of the maternity unit at Sligo General Hospital would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The regulation of dentistry in Ireland is the statutory responsibility of the Dental Council. It has an obligation and a duty to promote the highest standards in the practice of dentistry and to issue guidelines when necessary to support these standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Dental Council published guidelines in booklet form in 1996 on the administration of general anaesthesia and sedation and on resuscitation. The guidelines were circulated to all members of the dental profession. These guidelines were drawn up because of the evidence which had become available to the council, of poor standards of practice in this area. The guidelines lay down parameters which will ensure, in so far as it is possible that general anaesthesia and sedation will be practised safely in dental practice. They set out requirements regarding the use of drugs, the training of operators and support staff, the selection of patients and the standards of monitoring. The most important consideration and the council's principal concern in producing <Col N="1104" /> the guidelines is the welfare and safety of patients.</P>
    <P>The Dental Council is satisfied that the guidelines are appropriate, unambiguous, clear and can be defended scientifically. The council has advised that it has been and continues to be willing to discuss its guidelines with any group within the dental profession and would be happy to address any concerns identified by members of the profession.</P>
    <P>The council regularly reviews its guidelines and would, as part of a review, consider any submissions made by any member, group or other interested parties.</P>

      <P>Of the health care professionals that provide services for children, the profession of social worker has the most direct contact with children, especially in the area of child protection. Due to the recent rapid developments in this area, health boards have experienced some difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably qualified social workers. In order to address this problem, an additional 20 college places were made available for social work students in the 1995-96 academic year and this increase has since been maintained.</P>
      <P>Labour Court Recommendation 15515 recommended the setting up of an expert group to look at a range of issues relevant to paramedical grades in general. Social workers and child care workers are two of the professions being addressed by this group, and the terms of reference of the group include recruitment and retention. Difficulties in relation to this area were outlined at hearings of the group.</P>
      <P>As a means of addressing the issue, health service employers have given a commitment to establish formal links with the training colleges and are prepared to enter into discussions about manpower planning for the main paramedical professions, all of which are directly involved in the provision of health care to children. The relevant professional bodies will be invited to take part in the process. The Higher Education Authority and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance will also be involved, and at present a suitable mechanism is being sought which will allow maximum participation of the interested parties.</P>

      <P>The Government has provided more than £3.5 billion to the health services in 1999. This is an increase of 10 per cent on the 1998 provision, when hepatitis C compensation payments are excluded and is one of the most significant increases received by the health services in many years. These resources have allowed my Department, when determining net expenditure levels for health agencies, to take account of pay increases, non-pay inflation and other technical items and also to invest additional resources in a broad range of service areas.</P>
      <P>Each of the health boards and major agencies have adopted a service plan for 1999 within the approved determination. These service plans specify the quantum of services to be delivered over the course of the year. Progress in the current year would indicate that agencies are operating successfully in terms of both the activity and budgetary parameters underpinning their service plans.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a total of £20 million to the health agencies in respect of elective procedures and waiting list work during 1999. This represents an increase of 66 per cent over the allocation of £12 million for 1998 and an increase of 250 per cent over the amount allocated by the previous Government in 1997. Together with the recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative which I established in 1998, and which are currently being implemented by each health agency, I am glad to report that the numbers on the waiting lists went down by a total of 1887 during the first quarter of 1999.</P>

      <P>In December 1997 the Government established a cabinet committee to oversee the work of an interdepartmental working group whose task it would be to prepare a Green Paper on abortion. Work on drafting the Green Paper is proceeding. The process involves consideration of the constitutional, legal, medical, moral, ethical and social issues which arise regarding abortion. When the drafting has been completed I intend to convene another meeting of the cabinet committee, when it will commence consideration of the draft. Publication of the Green Paper must await a final decision of the Government in due course. I acknowledge that the process is taking longer than expected but I would point out that any dates given by me are at all times indicative, pending final approval by Government. It is the Government's intention to refer the Green Paper, when completed, to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office for National Statistics, London, has indicated to my Department that provisional statistics on the number of abortions carried out in the final quarter of 1998, will be published today. This will enable the number of abortions performed in 1998 on women with Irish addresses to be established. I will forward this information to the Deputy when my Department receives it. Provisional figures for the period from 1 January to 30 September 1998 indicate that 4,473 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in <Col N="1107" /> England and Wales in that period. A total of 5,336 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in 1997.</P>
    <P>I have made an additional £1 million &ndash; 1,269,738 &ndash; available to the health boards in 1999 for the further development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. The health boards have been asked to concentrate this additional funding on measures aimed at reducing the rate of unplanned pregnancy in women aged between 15 and 34 years, as the majority of abortions performed on Irish women involve women in this age group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. In 1998 I approved additional funding of £200,000 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew. As a result, a total of 42 patients are now attending the unit each week.</P>
      <P>I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that the cost of sending 11 patients outside the board's area for dialysis would amount to £222,900 per annum. Figures previously supplied by the board indicate that the cost of providing dialysis services for 12 additional patients at Waterford Regional Hospital would be almost £490,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that further demand for access to dialysis service exists and my Department will continue to work with the South-Eastern Health Board and other service providers in identifying overall needs. In this regard, expansion of dialysis services at Waterford Regional hospital will con<Col N="1108" /> tinue to be considered in the context of the board's competing priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the number of patients on public in-patient waiting lists has fallen by 1,887 in the first quarter of this year. The total number of persons recorded awaiting treatment on 31 March 1999 was 34,996, compared with 36,883 on 31 December 1998. This represents a reduction of 5.1 per cent since December and reverses the upward trend in waiting lists that started when the previous Government was in office.</P>
      <P>The decrease extends across a large number of hospitals and specialities. I believe that it vindicates my approach to addressing the issue of waiting lists in an integrated way, using a combination of short-term, medium term and long-term initiatives to deal with both the immediate problem and the underlying causes that have been giving rise to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have allocated a total of £20 million of dedicated funding to enable hospitals to provide treatments to patients who would otherwise have been <Col N="1110" /> waiting for significantly longer periods. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the funding allocated for this purpose in 1998 and it is 2.5 times higher than the funding given by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have allocated £9 million to services for older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services in 1999 in areas that will help to address the underlying causes of waiting lists. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds for elective work, including treatment of those on public in-patient waiting lists. The Deputies will be aware that the review group on the waiting list initiative identified inappropriate use of acute hospital beds, due to such factors as the shortage of step-down places and facilities for rehabilitation, as a key source of substantial waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>I am committed to building on the success achieved so far this year in reducing waiting lists by continuing the implementation of the recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative in a structured and integrated manner. My Department will continue to work closely with hospitals and health boards to ensure that both waiting times and waiting lists continue their welcome downward trend.</P>
    <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputies is in tabular form and will be forwarded to them.</P>

      <P>The new department will cost approximately £5 million and will include a properly designed spacious waiting area for patients and visitors, provision of 20 assessment cubicles and a dedicated emergency radiology room.

      <P>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. Long-term exposure to very high levels of radon gas in an enclosed area can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer, particularly where other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of radiation levels in the State is carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The institute provides a radon measurement and advisory service to householders.</P>
      <P>The institute has been carrying out a national geographically based radon survey since 1992 and has published two reports to date. A further report is due to be published shortly. The survey identifies areas of greater risk from high indoor radon levels and the results will be used to provide a comprehensive map of those areas in the country most affected by radon.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent survey of health boards carried out by the INOU which showed that the long-term unemployed were having difficulty in securing accurate information and were, in some cases, receiving misleading information regarding entitlement to retain a medical card on return to work; the steps, if any, he will take to ensure that full and correct information is available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The implementation of the 1996 budget provision concerning the retention of medical cards by persons who have been on the live register for at least twelve months who take up paid insurable employment and also to participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed is a matter for health board chief executives, who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the 1996 budget provision took effect a number of problems relating to its interpretation and application in particular circumstances have come to light. To address these issues a joint working group between my Department and the health boards was established to examine the issue and to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for retention of medical cards. In July 1998 the report of the group was approved by health board chief executive officers who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme. The chief executive officers asked the group to prepare revised guidelines based on the report. These revised guidelines have now been agreed by the group and arrangements are being made to have them circulated widely. The report also recommended improved training for staff. In this context, in association with the revised guidelines, a more detailed manual for staff will be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been made aware of the content of a survey carried out by the INOU based on phone calls to a number of health board <Col N="1149" /> offices. Details of the results of the survey have been circulated to health board chief executive officers.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services, including neurology and specialist nurses, is a matter for the health board or the voluntary hospital in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Brainwave, the Irish Epilepsy Association is currently running a pilot project in two health board areas, using a number of health board clinics to provide information, advice and counselling to people with epilepsy, their families and carers.</P>
      <P>As recommended in the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been set up in each health board area. These bring together health boards, voluntary sector service providers and consumers. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committee is to advise on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services. This year £3 million, £6 million full year cost in the year 2000, has been provided for the development of services. The allocation of funding out of this for the provision of clinics to provide advice, counselling and information to people with epilepsy, their families and their carers must be considered by each board in consultation with its co-ordinating committee.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991 in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.26 million is being provided by the health boards towards the service in 1999. The number of places currently funded is 7,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Child Care under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure including the financing and resourcing implications of its implementation. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. The Government has since established an interdepartmental committee on child care chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. This committee has been asked to report within a time frame of six months.</P>

      <P>Under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, the Irish Medicines Board is the statutory authority for the licensing of medicinal products, including Roaccutane and the question of a withdrawal of the authorisation for this product is entirely a matter for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am advised that the availability of the product, which is intended for the treatment of severe forms of acne unresponsive to other treatments, is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a consultant dermatologist. In addition, in recent years both the prescribing data for physicians and the patient information leaflet have been strengthened with additional warnings as to possible reactions, <Col N="1151" /> including suicide and suicide ideation, associated with the product. In these circumstances, the Irish Medicines Board does not consider it necessary to withdraw the authorisation for the product at this time.</P>
    <P>However, as with all medicinal products, the board continues to monitor the safety of the product and, in line with its statutory responsibilities, will take whatever action in relation to the product as it may deem necessary.</P>

It is an autonomous body independent of the board in relation to its day to day operation. Its employees are not employees of the board and their pay, terms and conditions of employment are not controlled by the board.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 25 May, in reply to a similar question, An t-Árd Chláraitheoir has advised that there has been an increased demand for certificates of entries of births, deaths and marriages in recent times. While his office has managed to maintain a normal service to personal callers, the postal and authorisation services are somewhat in arrears. However, additional resources have been provided and the postal backlog in respect of applications for certificates for post 1900 events, in particular, had by that stage been reduced from nine weeks to approximately six weeks. A further reduction has been achieved in the interim and the delay is now five weeks. It is anticipated that a further improvement will be achieved by the end of the week. Priority is being given to these applications, as such certificates are more likely to be required for other services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the special tax benefits that the Deputy is referring to are the capital allowances introduced by way of section 22 of the Finance Act, 1998. Section 22 provides for the granting of capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure on the construction, extension or refurbishment of buildings used as private, registered nursing homes and for such expenditure on the conversion of an existing building into such a nursing home. To qualify for the allowance the nursing home must be registered with a health board under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Section 22 makes provision for these allowances to be clawed back if the building is sold or ceases to be a qualifying nursing home within ten years. This is to ensure that the nursing home will continue in use for a reasonable amount of time. Where a capital allowance is to be clawed back the person who claimed the allowance is obliged to include the clawback in his or her return of income for the relevant year in which the clawback is due.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that claims to capital allowances in respect of such buildings and the continuing entitlement to such allowances are subject to Revenue audit procedures. The audit may be a verification audit, which is confined to verifying a particular item on the return, such as a claim to capital allowances. Alternatively, the entitlement to capital allowances may be verified as part of a comprehensive audit of the taxpayer's affairs. Information coming to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners regarding disposals of buildings would be monitored to ensure that the appropriate adjustments are made.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a tax deduction for expenses incurred by employees is provided for under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Expenses allowable to employees are confined to: expenses necessarily incurred in travelling in the performance of the duties of the employment; expenses wholly and exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties.</P>
      <P>Flat rate expenses deductions are generally negotiated between the Revenue Commissioners and representative bodies of groups of employees, e.g. trade unions, employees association, to apply on a global basis within the sector. This is good administrative practice both from Revenue's and from the particular sector's point of view. Following these negotiations agreement is reached on a global figure which would represent the amount of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by that particular group of employees in the performance of their duties.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have agreed flat rate expenses with the Irish Federation of University Teachers in respect of university teachers and lecturers. No flat rate expense allowance has been negotiated by IFUT on behalf of university librarians.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the interest charge arises because the taxpayer failed to comply with the preliminary tax rules in relation to the 1996-97 income tax year. As the Deputy is aware, the self assessment system for income tax has brought major advantages both to Revenue and to the taxpayer and it is essential that the integrity of the system be protected. One of the crucial elements of self assessment is the payment by the taxpayer of the correct preliminary tax liability by the relevant due date. Concerns had arisen that an increasing number of taxpayers were failing to comply with this requirement and the Commissioners had to address the problem by raising interest charges in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to, an interest charge was considered appropriate because no preliminary tax was paid by the taxpayer in respect of the 1996-97 income tax year. It was also noted that the taxpayer has consistently failed to meet the preliminary tax rules for many years. The effect of this is that much of his tax liability is paid considerably later than it should be paid, nineteen months late in the case of the 1996-97 tax year. The Revenue Commissioners have again carefully reviewed this case. However, they cannot accept that the interest charge should be waived because the tax itself has been paid.</P>
      <P>Prior to the Deputy's parliamentary question, the taxpayer and his agent were in touch with the Revenue Commissioners, and, in an effort to assist, it was agreed to accept payment of the interest charge over a number of months. If it would be helpful, the Commissioners would be prepared to consider the possibility of allowing a somewhat longer time for payment and the taxpayer may wish to contact the Office of the Collector-General, Sarsfield House, Francis Street, Limerick, telephone 1890 20 30 70, to discuss this possibility further.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes received a letter from the tax<Col N="1158" /> payer on 21 May 1998 in which she said that she wished to claim tax relief for medical expenses she had incurred in connection with her daughter's illness. The inspector sent a MED 1 form to the taxpayer for completion.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer subsequently telephoned the inspector and told him that she was a medical card holder. She was advised that tax relief is only available for unreimbursed medical expenses and, as she had not incurred qualifying medical expenses, e.g. hospital charges, cost of medicines etc., on behalf of her daughter, the question of tax relief did not arise.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer did not return the MED 1 form to the inspector.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer may be entitled to claim tax relief of ancillary expenses she incurred in connection with her daughter's treatment, for example, the cost of travel to and from hospital in Dublin. The inspector has sent a new MED 1 form to the taxpayer for completion. On receipt of the completed documentation, the inspector will review the taxpayer's affairs for the 1997-98 tax year and make any refund which may be due.</P>

      <Quest>the reason successful candidates in the open competition for appointment to the posts as clerical assistant typists and placed on a panel in August 1998 for the Waterford area have not been offered employment; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that full-time and permanent vacancies are being filled by FÁS on a temporary basis; if their names are still on a panel; and when they will be offered a position.</Quest>

      <P>The filling of vacancies in the Civil Service is undertaken by the Civil Service Commissioners, at the request of Departments and Offices when vacancies occur. The Commissioners have been requested to fill two permanent clerical typist vacancies in Waterford and are currently considering candidates for these vacancies. Further candidates will be considered for such positions in Waterford as vacancies are notified to the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the filling of vacancies on a temporary basis through FÁS is that during the course of 1998 the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs experienced a build up of clerical staff vacancies in its services in Waterford. This build up of vacancies was exacerbated by difficulties in sourcing recruits through the normal channels. In an effort to alleviate the staffing difficulties, which were approaching critical proportions, the Department decided, with the approval of the Department of Finance, to employ temporary staff on a limited term contract basis. In order to expedite the process of obtaining temporary staff a list of potentially suitable people was obtained from FÁS. Potential temporary staff identified in this way <Col N="1159" /> were invited to apply for temporary posts and, following a competitive process, seven temporary clerical officers were appointed in August of 1998. Concurrent with the employment of the temporary staff the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs continued in its efforts to obtain the permanent staff needed to fill vacancies on an ongoing basis. The contracts of the temporary staff recruited in this manner will expire in August of 1999 and will not be renewed.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy has in mind patients using ostomy products.</P>
      <P>Persons with medical cards receive drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances without charge. Health boards may also make arrangements under the long-term illness scheme for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature who do not hold a medical card. There are 15 specified conditions covered under the long-term illness scheme. The scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of conditions covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines, such as the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drugs refund scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from 1 July 1999 these two community drugs schemes are in fact being replaced by a new scheme, the drug payment scheme, which merges the best elements of both schemes. Under the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for use in that month. For the first time, families and individuals will be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals claim reimbursement on expenditure over £90 on prescribed drugs and medicines for use in a calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and may have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund, which may result in considerable cash flow problems. Under the new drug payment scheme, there is no potential for such cash flow <Col N="1160" /> problems. The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has other distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example, in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new drug payment scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the new drug payment scheme. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribes medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old drug cost subsidisation scheme where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also wish to know that, where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in the light of the arrangements I have outlined, appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State to those with ongoing medical expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The common contract for consultant medical staff was introduced on 1 April 1981. Prior to the introduction of the common contract consultants were, broadly speaking, remunerated under two separate and distinctly different systems of remuneration. In the case of health board appointments, consultants were usually permanent and pensionable employees who were remunerated on a salary basis with limited rights to private practice. In the voluntary hospitals, sessional payments and salaries were sometimes paid to non-clinical consultants but clinical consultants were usually remunerated by way of daily capitation rates which went into a hospital &ldquo;pool&rdquo; to be divided up by the consultants concerned.</P>
      <P>The notion of a contract arose from a series of reports which all referred to the need to introduce standard conditions and rates of payments as well as the Government's decision to extend free hospital care to all sections of the population. A working party on a common contract and common selection procedure for consultants was established in December 1977. It was from the interim report of this committee that the common contract emerged following negotiations between management and staff representatives.</P>
      <P>The contract was last reviewed in detail by the review body on higher remuneration in its report to the Minister for Finance on hospital consultants &ndash; report No. 36. Following lengthy negotiations between the management and representatives of the medical consultants a new contract was introduced with effect from 1 January 1998. The remuneration rates referred to in that report were updated by the same review body's report No. 37 which dealt generally with higher level remuneration in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contract initially emerged from a need to standardise recruitment, pay and conditions of hospital consultants in the public health services generally. Clearly, in devising a contract such as this however, which deals with a wide variety of administrative issues, there is the opportunity to ensure that clinical aspects of care in the public hospital setting are consistent and of a sufficiently high standard. The current contract also makes provisions to protect a healthy balance between <Col N="1162" /> public and private commitments of hospital consultants as provided for in the health strategy &ndash; shaping a healthier future; as well as providing for the development of clinical audit, management functions and continuing medical education of consultants. It also delineates in clear terms the nature of the consultant's role and responsibilities <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of his-her employing authority.</P>

      <P>In 1997, following from the report to which the Deputy refers, the European Parliament voted in favour of the drafting of legislation which would require infant formulae, follow-on formulae and cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and children to be pesticide free.</P>
      <P>EU legislation on infant formulae is set down in Directive 91/321, as amended, and legislation on cereal-based baby foods is set down in Directive 96/5. Arising from the vote by the Parliament, these legal instruments were amended by the Commission to provide for a maximum residue level for pesticides of 0.01 mg/kg in these products. These Commission proposals must be formally approved by the Council and the full European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Directive 1999/39 amending Directive 96/5 was adopted by the Council on 6 May 1999 and was published in the Official Journal on 18 May 1999. This directive will come into force in all member states in July 2002.</P>

      <P>The loan, for a principal of £7 million, was raised in 1981 and was used solely for the new hospital project.

      <P>The loan was approved by Allied Irish Banks Limited to the Beaumont hospital board at triple &ldquo;A&rdquo; rates, repayable over a five year period.

      <P>The implementation of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, which came into operation in October, 1998, provided for the establishment of a central treatment list, imposing <Col N="1164" /> strict controls over the prescribing and dispensing of methadone. In addition methadone could only be dispensed to patients registered on this list who held a drug treatment card. These regulations were necessary in order to prevent inappropriate prescribing of methadone, which, in some cases, was resulting in its availability on the illicit market.</P>
      <P>Leading up to and following the introduction of the regulations a small number of general practitioners, who prescribed to large numbers of patients did not become involved in the methadone scheme. As a consequence, their patients have had to be accommodated at treatment centres around the Dublin area.  The numbers registered in treatment at the end of August, 1998 was 3371, the numbers registered in treatment has continued to rise to 3,829 at 17 May 1999. There are now 100 general practitioners and 155 community pharmacists participating in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Methadone is now provided at 40 Eastern Health Board treatment locations, 19 of which were established in 1998, and through general practitioners. During 1998 the Health Board provided an additional 715 treatment places in its services. Because of the increased availability of treatment locations, the demand for treatment has increased, causing an increase in the waiting list. The waiting list for treatment at 31 August 1998, prior to the introduction of the methadone regulations was 500. Services for these people could only be provided at five locations. The current waiting list is 618, but 11 treatment locations now deal with the waiting lists. The board is presently involved in an exercise to validate waiting list figures.</P>
      <P>The increase in numbers in treatment and the increased participation by general practitioners and community pharmacists demonstrate that the methadone protocol has not contributed to delays in treatment.</P>
      <P>The demand for treatment continues to grow, however, as treatment facilities continue to be developed. The Eastern Health Board's service plan for 1999 includes the provision of additional treatment locations aimed at eliminating waiting lists and providing treatment to people in their own local area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 110, 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are: adults awaiting cataract operation, 2,826; adults awaiting total hip replacements, 1,317; patients awaiting cardiac surgery, 1,187.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, figures are collected on a quarterly basis and these figures relate to the quarter ended 31 March 1999.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the overall number of patients awaiting medical procedures at the end of March this year is reduced from the figure at the end of 1998. This reduction is undoubtedly due to the considerable initiatives I have undertaken since coming into office in relation to the management of the waiting list initiative. These include an allocation of £20 million to agencies for the treatment of patients on waiting lists; the provision of £9 million to services for older people; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list should be operated.</P>
      <P>The number of patients who will receive treatment this year, as a result of the waiting list initiative funding, is currently being collated. The service agreements for 1999, which will specify what procedures health agencies will perform under the initiative, are due into my Department and I expect to be in receipt of all agreements shortly.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these initiatives will continue to have a significant positive impact on waiting lists for the remainder of the year, and more importantly that waiting times for public patients will be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three paediatric hospitals located within the Dublin area, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, The Children's Hospital, Temple Street, and the National Children's Hospital located at the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the relocation of the National Children's Hospital to the new hospital in Tallaght ensures that its patients have access to facilities of the highest standard. I have also granted approval to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children to appoint a design team for the development of theatre facilities at the hospital which is an integral part of that hospital's cardiac surgery development. The Deputy will also be aware that the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street to the Mater Hospital campus has been under consideration for some time by the religious orders who own the two hospitals concerned. My Department supports the transfer of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater campus because of the need to improve the quality of paediatric hospital accommodation and the potential benefits to both hospitals of shared infrastructural support and complementary clinical services.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I approved the appointment of the design team for the Mater Hospital development. Its initial task will be the preparation of a development control plan (DCP) for the entire Mater site, including the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. In the interim it is vital that existing services for children on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard and I have approved funding in the region of £1.6 million for the refurbishment of the accident and emergency department and the provision of new accommodation at that hospital.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision of modern paediatric facilities and I believe that the relocation of the National Children's Hospital and the development plans for both Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, are evidence of this commitment.</P>

The planning and carrying out of the works &ndash; estimated cost £1.55 million &ndash; which involves the general refurbishment of the dwellings together with the provision of bathroom facilities where necessary, is a matter for the local authority. The proposals include certain works to purchased houses and the approval is subject to the normal requirement of the scheme that 50 per cent funding is the maximum which may be provided by my Department towards the cost of eligible works to such houses.</P>

      <P>The free travel companion pass, which is available to certain people who are medically assessed as unfit to travel alone, enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
      <P>In general, a companion free travel pass is only available to persons aged over 66 if they held a pass when they were under 66. Other eligible categories include people who are blind, confined to wheelchairs, those who are 75 years and over who are certified as unfit to travel alone and people who are being cared for by a carer who is in receipt of a carer's allowance. Recipients of invalidity pensions must satisfy one of the conditions outlined above in order to qualify for a companion pass.</P>
      <P>The companion pass is also available to recipients of a disability allowance (formerly disabled persons maintenance allowance) who are certified as unfit to travel alone. This facility is available to this category since 1990 on the basis that this group of people were unlikely to be in a position to pay a companion to accompany them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned, who is 66 years of age, is in receipt of a retirement pension from the Department and did not have a companion free travel pass when he was under 66. He is not wheelchair bound and consequently he is not eli<Col N="1174" /> gible, under the existing rules for a companion pass.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes, including the companion free travel pass scheme, has commenced to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner and the qualifying conditions for the scheme will be examined as part of the review process.</P>

      <P>The deserted wife's benefit (DWB) was replaced in January 1997 by the one-parent family payment. No new applications for the DWB scheme were accepted after that date though it remains available to those who were in receipt of the benefit on 1 January 1997 and will remain payable to them for the duration of their continuous entitlement. At the end of April 1999 there were 13,664 cases still in payment.</P>
      <P>Earnings are dealt with in two ways under the DWB scheme. There is no income limit for persons who claimed the benefit on or before 31 August 1992. Claims made after that date are subject to income limits.</P>
      <P>At present a recipient will receive full benefit where earnings are less than £10,000 per annum. A reduced rate is payable where earnings are between £10,000 and £14,000 per annum. The income disregards which apply to DWB are much more favorable than those which apply to the one-parent family payment.</P>
      <P>The benefit is not withdrawn on a pound for pound basis, instead a percentage of a recipients personal rate is payable at different income ranges as follows:</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have introduced a new staffing schedule which will result in substantial improvements in teacher staffing levels in the 1999-2000 school year. The reduction in the appointment figure for a second teacher to 14 pupils means that St. Mary's national school qualifies for the appointment of a second teacher with effect from 1 September 1999.</P>

      <P>I am aware that my Department does not, as yet, provide a psychological service to all primary schools in County Cavan and I realise that there is a need for all school children to have access to this service. For this reason, I announced, on February 11 last, the decision by the Government to establish a national educational psychological service agency. The sum of £1.5 million was made available in last Decembers budget for the initial phase of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Expansion of the psychological service of this Department has now begun. Advertisements for additional psychologists were placed earlier this month. It is intended to appoint 25 psychologists during 1999. In accordance with the implementation plan for the new agency, it is intended to appoint a further 25 psychologists during the year 2000. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five year period, and it is hoped that there will be the nucleus of a psychological service in every county by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Decisions on the assignments of the additional psychologists will be made later in the year. Priority for the expansion of the psychological service will be given to those areas with a high incidence of educational disadvantage and with little access to other psychological services. My Department is, therefore, currently examining the needs and resources in all areas, including County Cavan, in order to set priorities.</P>
    <P>The national educational psychological service will be organised in close consultation with the Department of Health and Children, whose clinical services will also continue to provide help for families and children.</P>

      <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full-time or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>This application is being considered in the context of my recent initiative. The school inspector has been asked to provide an up-to-date report on this pupil's special educational needs.</P>
