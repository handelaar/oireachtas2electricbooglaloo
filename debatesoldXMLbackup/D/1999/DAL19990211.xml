      <P>It is proposed to take No. 26, the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Second Stage (resumed); and No. 5, the Health (Eastern Regional Health Authority) Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>

      <P>In view of the failure of the measures taken by the Government arising from the Bacon housing report, what proposals will the Taoiseach and the Government bring to the House to ensure that couples can buy a house, given the allegation that they need £200,000 a year to be able to do so? What has happened to the 100,000 sites the Government promised would be available last year and this year for young couples to build their homes?</P>

      <P>Is there legislation promised on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation promised. This matter was debated last week. It is of some satisfaction that we have moved from building 10,000 houses a few years ago to building more than 40,000 this year. We have the Serviced Land Initiative and other measures which were outlined by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not working. People, including gard, teachers and journalists, cannot buy houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Government has attempted to take some measures to deal with the housing crisis, which is not of any one party's making. However, in light of Dr. Bacon's comments this morning and the studies which have recently been published, will the Government consider introducing legislation to ensure that 20 <Col N="522" /> per cent of all land to be rezoned will be reserved for affordable social housing, given that somebody on £20,000 a year cannot afford to buy a house? Unless a specific legislative measure, along the lines the Labour Party has proposed, is introduced, the 100,000 sites will not go to the people who need them most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn knows, that matter is already being looked at by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Deputy Owen's facts are wrong. Published and unpublished data show that the rate of increase in new house prices in the Dublin area fell in the September quarter of 1998 to 2.2 per cent from 10.6 per cent in the June quarter. These figures were published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government some months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who has responsibility for housing, is looking at the issue of additional supply, which we all accept is necessary. Can he indicate to the House that the Minister of State will introduce legislation as a matter of urgency to ensure that local authorities, which are currently rezoning land by public decision, will be empowered to make 20 per cent of that land available for affordable housing? This issue needs legislation now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had unsatisfactory answers to the first matter. Are there any proposals to amend the health and safety Acts, in view of the almost disastrous fire in the mine in County Meath last night where a number of people were trapped underground? Will the Government commission a report on this issue to ensure it does not happen again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no promised legislation but, from the report of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, it appears the safety statement under the Health and Safety Act worked extremely well last evening. I congratulate all those involved in drafting it and in implementing it last night. We could have had a very difficult situation. That legislation and the work that went into implementing it in Tara Mines proved very successful. Of course Tara Mines are investigating the problems with a view <Col N="524" /> to making improvements and they will report in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is a topic of considerable public concern and in the light of the shared interest that all political parties have, would the Taoiseach consider enabling the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to brief environmental spokespersons to get constructive agreement on this measure which affects us all?</P>

However, the Minister says the Bill will not be ready until summer which means that another school year will start without the Education Welfare Bill in place.

      <P>When I spoke on this Bill this day last week I indicated it was not often that I had the opportunity or inclination to praise Deputy Roche's contribution. The speech he made was an important one which should be read carefully by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs and all Fianna Fáil backbenchers. He is opposed to the Government making contributions to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment <Col N="528" /> Facility of the IMF which has had the effect of deepening poverty and the debt of the countries which it is claimed it seeks to help. The Government should agree to withdraw the Bill and argue for the necessary reforms to ESAF before it will consider making contributions to it.</P>
      <P>The Jubilee 2000 Campaign indicates that 1 billion people are trapped under a mountain of debt; that African countries spend four times more on interest repayments on loans than on health care; that spending per person in the world's 37 poorest countries has fallen by 50 per cent on health and 25 per cent on education; that debt fuels the drugs trade as poor farmers turn to growing high value cash crops such as opium and cocaine; that the rain forests are being destroyed to provide timber and beef to earn foreign currency to repay debts; that for every £1 given by rich countries poor countries repay nearly £4 in debt repayments; that an estimated 250,000 jobs have been lost in Europe because countries impoverished by debt have been unable to buy our goods, and that more than 500,000 children die each year because of cutbacks in health services.</P>
      <P>That is an appalling litany in the modern world in which the resources are available to ensure every person has enough to eat and every child can survive into old age. While the contribution Ireland makes is relatively small, it is important to maintain a principled position on how the World Bank, the IMF and other agencies which seek to help poorer developing countries operate.</P>
      <P>The external evaluation of ESAF early last year indicated that its programme was deficient in many critical respects. It has had the effect of making many poor countries poorer by ensuring social, health and education services would have to be cut to meet the criteria established. What is even more galling is that the decision of the Government to contribute to ESAF has resulted in a reduction in the amount paid in direct aid to poor countries. It has been shown that the direct aid programmes operated by organisations such as Concern Worldwide, Trócaire and GOAL are much more effective.</P>
      <P>This is the second U-turn the Government has made on international affairs issues. It has reversed the decision made by the Government of which I was a member which refused to make a contribution to ESAF until such time as it was reformed to ensure it did not impact adversely on developing countries. The Government decided recently to join Partnership for Peace, about which I have spoken. These are ominous signals that there is a fundamental shift in the approach of the Government to international relations. I will return to this aspect on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister argued that to encourage reform we must get involved and make a contribution to ESAF, that this will enable us to advocate certain courses of action. There is, however, no commitment that if reforms are not introduced we will withdraw our contribution. There is a statement by the IMF that it welcomes the external review <Col N="529" /> of ESAF but there are no proposals to introduce reforms. In their report dated 23 March 1998, vol. 27, No. 6, the directors stated that they agreed that it would be desirable to review the effects of the adjustment measures on poor groups as part of the regular ESAF programme reviews and that they had asked management and staff to explore the feasibility of these suggestions, including the availability of the necessary data, and to assess the ability of the World Bank to provide the envisaged services and to come back to them with operational proposals. That is a weak acceptance of the reality as a result of the ESAF programme.</P>
    <P>On a recent programme on Mozambique broadcast by RTE, Myles Dungan made the point to an IMF spokesperson that the debt of poor countries should be cancelled. The response was that it appeared to be a good idea and that he must talk to his bank manager about cancelling his mortgage. If senior IMF officials are of the view that the minor inconvenience of their mortgages is comparable with the appalling deprivation in Africa and other parts of the developing world, I can understand how they can construct programmes which are designed, on the face of it, to ease the situation but which make it worse. They are committed to an ideological stance that nobody should be allowed to get away with debt.</P>
    <P>The poor of Africa are not the ones who took on the debt; it was not their decision that bankers would pour billions of pounds into their countries. Much of it has gone on arms sales. In Mozambique much of the debt was built up in fighting a war generated by the apartheid regime in South Africa to protect its flank. Yet, the people of Mozambique are being asked to pay the price by watching their children die because money is not available for health services, for a clean water supply next to their homes or to educate them about hygiene. People have to walk 50 miles daily to get clean water.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for an Irish Government, which I accept is committed to the idea of ending poverty in the Third World, to pretend the decision to make a contribution to ESAF is of no great importance. It is relatively small in money terms, but the underlying thinking is wrong. Even at this late stage, the Government should withdraw this Bill and insist the IMF reform ESAF before it makes a contribution, not after the fact.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the IMF takes into account all the macro-economic indicators; it looks for growth, balance of payments, debt reduction but it does not take into account the literacy levels in a country and how they can be raised; it does not take into account the infant mortality rates in a country when it assesses its progress and it does not take into account the unemployment levels. For example, the IMF insisted that the Mozambique Government sell off all the companies under its control. This was a purely ideological decision and had no basis in real economics. One hundred thousand jobs were lost because of that decision enforced by the IMF. <Col N="530" /> If the Government had not carried it out, the IMF would not have provided any assistance.</P>
    <P>This is happening with a nod and wink from this Government. I am not prepared to accept that; I am prepared to vote against this Bill on Second Stage. I urge those in Fianna Fáil who have said in this House they do not agree with this Bill to vote against it. I particularly urge Deputy Cooper-Flynn who took a principled stand in this House last night to do the same on this Bill. Lives are at stake; not reputations, but lives. Deputy Cooper-Flynn and the four Independents who support this Government should make it clear to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that they will vote against this Bill if it insists on pushing it through. It is not a question of reputations or us being good guys in Europe, with the IMF or the World Bank; it is a question of seeking to put in place policies which will save lives in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to withdraw this Bill. If it does not, the Independents and the Fianna Fáil Deputies &ndash; Deputy Roche made a strong speech against the Bill &ndash; should stand up and be counted on this issue. It is not right that the continuation of a dogma of neo-liberalism which is rapidly becoming discredited is being used to cause more death and poverty in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to withdraw this Bill and to get its act together once and for all. It should listen to the organisations on the ground who have written to every Deputy in the House, saying this Bill is bad, for example, the Irish Missionary Union, which represents dozens of religious organisations who operate in the Third World. They see the effects of the ESAF programme on a daily basis and speak from experience. I urge the Government to take on board what they have to say.</P>
    <P>I also urge it to take on board what the Debt Coalition has to say &ndash; a body which is representative of many organisations who think it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to deal with the question of debt. It is urging that debt be cancelled to enable these countries to provide health and education services and water, the only basis on which these countries can develop. I appeal to the Government to withdraw the Bill and to the Fianna Fáil Deputies to stand up and be counted when it comes to the vote on Second Stage to ensure this Bill is defeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from going through the list of horrendous circumstances in Third World countries outlined by Deputy De Rossa. Every Member of this House is aware of it and subscribes to looking for solutions; everyone is extremely concerned about the Third World. However, we must look at our options. One is to continue as we have done for years in calling for debt cancellation and other such solutions; or we can do what the Minister for Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs are doing, which is to bring forward solutions which will help, solutions which will cost us some money but which will at <Col N="531" /> least start the process of alleviating the difficulties being faced by these people. I welcome the provisions in the Bill for our contribution to the international task of debt relief.</P>
      <P>The problems of many of the developing countries stem from a time when they were encouraged and facilitated in huge borrowings which were often wastefully invested or defrauded. Democratic governments are labouring under the burden of debt and are often prevented from investing in the type of infrastructure that countries desperately need by the actions of their predecessors.</P>
      <P>However, it is not so long since we had a similar problem; although not to the same extent. We were wasting our energy and finances trying to keep civil control of the country. We were wasting millions of pounds patrolling the Border when people were waiting for health services and educational opportunities. We can understand to a small extent what is happening. We tend to forget, when we outline how these people cannot access education and health services because of their debt burden, that in 1987 we were paying a third of all income tax raised to service our debt. Even now we tend to forget we have a national debt and that we owe £28.8 billion. Despite falling interest rates and the fact that the figure has decreased slightly in the past year, it still cost more to service that debt last year than in the previous year.</P>
      <P>We paid that and witnessed the difficulties of not having the facilities which would have been available if the taxes collected were used in a better fashion. We tend to lecture these countries about how they should handle their problems, but internal strife here cost us; and waste throughout the 1970s and 1980s by Governments and all parties cost us. We are in a position to reach out and help; we should understand. We needed finance from abroad; we got it from European funding and we must repay some of it. Rhetoric is easy and sounds good; it grabs headlines and eases our consciences. I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>We are making a positive gesture. None of us is happy that it is the end of the road. There should be a formal mechanism for raising this issue on a regular basis in this House and in the Seanad. I ask the Minister to ensure, at a minimum, an annual debate on this issue. The countries that stand to benefit from this initiative have problems far greater than ours. I emphasise that before I am compared with the gentleman who wanted to abandon his mortgage. We can understand their plight. It is only through concerted international effort, drawing on the expertise of the World Bank, the IMF, the UN and the European Union that it can be resolved. Decisions will have to be taken in their home countries but they will need help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-1980s we came into the MacSharry era and started to win the battle against poverty. We have to help the people in these countries in a practical fashion, as we were helped. <Col N="532" /> As Deputy De Rossa said, Ireland has an honourable tradition in direct assistance to many countries which have experienced famine and national disasters. To match the commitment of individuals and groups who do good work, programmes such as that contained in the Bill are needed.</P>
    <P>Many friends of mine have laboured abroad and on their return outlined the situation in Third World countries. Debt cancellation is one of the options they suggest. Is that achievable? I commend the debt relief initiative and look forward to further progress in that area.</P>
    <P>A second important feature of the Bill is the provision to enable the Central Bank to accept the one-time allocation special drawing rights by the IMF. I have full confidence that such a draw will not be necessary in the future but it bolsters the case for international solidarity in times of financial crisis. That may impinge on us more than we expect or wish.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued to hear recently that Mr. George Soros, who was once credited with breaking sterling, has in his book, <i>The Price of Global Capitalism, </i>called for greater international regulation of the financial markets. The ability of the financial markets to move huge sums of capital around the world quickly in search of speculative profits causes grave concern to anyone who is concerned about attaining or maintaining real economic growth to benefit society. We have witnessed attacks on our currency and have been vulnerable at certain times during the past ten years. We are a small nation but we must do what we can to support any actions to restrict the George Soros of this world and we have to work with the major bodies in that. To protect the vulnerable countries from speculative attack the greatest solidarity is needed between states of the IMF. It is easy to criticise the larger bodies and say they are not pursuing the correct policies and cancelling debt and that we should plough a lone furrow. Participation will strengthen our hand and allow us have a say. We should continue to do that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to participate in the international support package for Brazil. The stand taken recently by Brazil against the speculators has been a lonely one. It has seen the currency of many of its South American neighbours, as well as far eastern countries, fall victims to huge waves of selling. This is the effect that can be brought about by individuals and corporate bodies. We have to play our part, not through rhetoric, media headlines, or speeches but through positive action. That is what we are beginning to take.</P>
    <P>The crisis faced by Brazil is not a remote problem. Failure to support the Brazilian currency could lead to a renewed global economic crisis considerably worse than that witnessed last year, which sent tremors through the financial institutions. Such a crisis would lead to a round of competitive devaluations which could plunge the world economy into recession. The promised $50 billion support package for Brazil will go a long <Col N="533" /> way to preventing that crisis. We must be seen to support these actions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is further confirmation of Ireland's commitment to international prosperity. Whether in debt relief or currency support, Ireland is demonstrating a willingness to play its part in restraining the world excesses of global capitalism and encouraging international development. We have a proud record mainly of individuals, religious and voluntary groups working in these countries. As the Minister for Finance outlined in his opening speech, it is time to take positive action and move forward.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>We can talk or we can take positive action. In the period 1985-7 when this country was rattled, people could see no way out of the quagmire. That period enables us to empathise with the people in Third World countries. We must be prepared to say where we can help and proceed to do it. The aid workers who have met and lobbied all of us have called for cancellation of the debt. If I thought we could achieve that I would be happy to vote aginst this Bill but it is not achievable in the circumstances. For that reason I support the Bill and wish to see it implemented.</P>
      <P>I repeat my call to formalise a procedure to debate issues such as this not once every three or four years but once a year to document and evaluate our contribution towards these countries, rather than wait for major international change. I welcome the steps taken. I have no argument with those who point out the horrendous situations existing in these countries and call for a different solution. This is costing us little enough money but is a gesture in the right direction.</P>

      <P>The following are the words of a missionary friend:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The culture of debt has got a new life here in Malawi. I am just too tired burying people. The villagers, old and young alike, who need not die, have little time for anything else. The disease is caused by so-called structural adjustments by the international monetary fund and the country's finance ministers working together. Structural adjustment means how tightly can you tighten your belt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What underlines all of this is the decision by the IMF to insist that the Government should not subsidise fertiliser for maize production. This has resulted in a drastic drop in the maize harvest of up to 50 per cent in many areas as small farmers cannot afford to purchase fertiliser. This means six months of hunger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the oil crisis of 1978, great sums of money flowed into the banks around the world. To put them to profitable use the international banks sent their sales people to Third World <Col N="534" /> countries to offer cheap loans. In many cases the loans were used for unviable projects or were siphoned off by corrupt politicians. In the following years, interest rates doubled twice as the value of the dollar increased. The Third World countries were unable to repay the hugely increased sums. Since then, Africa and other Third World countries have carried that overweaning burden.</P>
    <P>Africa spends four times more repaying interest on its loans than on health care. For every £1 given in aid by rich countries, poor countries spend nearly £4 in debt repayments. It is estimated that 500,000 children die each year due to cutbacks in health services in these countries. It is further estimated that cancelling the unpayable debt of the 20 worst affected countries will cost the creditors about £4.5 billion, less than the cost of one Stealth bomber. The cost to this State for settling Army deafness claims has been estimated at £1 billion. This gives an indication of how miniscule, in world terms, is the debt problem of those 20 countries.</P>
    <P>The burden of debt repayment has meant the channelling of resources away from basic services such as education, health care, agriculture, food and water security. The structural adjustments I mentioned earlier are forcing the poorest people in those countries to suffer and die. A new approach is needed to help these countries. The IMF enhanced structural adjustment facility is not that new approach.</P>
    <P>The Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill proposes to authorise this Government to contribute £7 million to the IMF enhanced structural adjustment facility. Is the Minister satisfied this contribution will be used for the benefit of the poorest people of the countries which will get these loans? Has he considered whether that money could be more beneficially used by giving it to aid agencies who are working at the coalface and with the people who are in dire need?</P>
    <P>I accept the debt issue must be addressed, but not at the cost of millions of lives. I look forward to discussing this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage. Ireland is contributing money to the IMF and the World Bank to tackle the problem of debt repayment, but I would like to be reassured that the Government is satisfied the money is being used for the maximum benefit of the people for whom it is meant. We have a moral duty to speak for the downtrodden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I congratulate the Government backbench Deputies who made important and considered contributions to the debate. Deputies Michael Ahern and Roche reflect a view which they reached following representations by various bodies, particularly the Debt and Development Coalition in Ireland and a number of religious organisations. These groups are directly involved in the delivery of assistance in underprivileged <Col N="535" /> parts of the world which have been devastated by disasters.</P>
      <P>It is worth putting on record some of the Debt and Development Coalition's observations on this Bill. The group's main concern is the contribution of £7 million. It is also concerned that the Bill will permit the Minister for Finance to make further payments to the IMF and the World Bank without reference to, or agreement of, the Oireachtas. There is no provision for accountability by the Minister to the Oireachtas on policies pursued by Ireland in the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The coalition opposes the Bill for other reasons. It believes the IMF programmes undermine democracy. They are designed by the IMF in its Washington offices and the IMF deals mainly with finance ministers and governors of central banks rather than with elected members of parliaments. IMF monetary policy does not take into account the human development needs in these countries. The results are seen in reductions in primary school attendance, increases in malnutrition, the collapse of local industry and widespread unemployment. As Deputy De Rossa said earlier, some of the comments of IMF personnel about debt cancellation are disrespectful and include throwaway remarks about mortgages, as if there were relativity between the debts of the world's poorest nations and one's mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>The Bill authorises the Minister to make further payments. No contribution should be made without the agreement of the Oireachtas. Contributions should not be made to organisations which operate behind closed doors. The provisions in the Bill, if implemented, could have a devastating effect on severely disadvantaged countries. The IMF response to the debt crisis &ndash; the enhanced structural adjustment facility &ndash; has created more problems than it has solved. In some countries where the ESAF has been used to reform economies, the debt burden has increased.</P>
      <P>Irish society is open and responsive to debt and financial crises. Irish people are recognised for their generosity, particularly in times of crisis. Our biggest charitable organisations are those devoted to raising funds for and carrying out relief and development work in Third World countries. Irish people have also always understood the need to assist people suffering the consequences of various disasters, regardless of our national debt. We have often disregarded other difficulties such as high unemployment and poverty at home. We have always been extremely generous and have a proud record of intervening and helping in some of the world's worst natural disasters. Irish missionaries and relief agencies were among the first to highlight the level of poverty and suffering which was, and still is, prevalent in the sub-Sahara region of Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Labour Party was in Government I was proud of its record in increasing the State's contribution to overseas development aid. <Col N="536" /> Throughout its participation in Government, the ODA budget increased from 0.2 per cent to 0.31 per cent of GDP. Given a booming Celtic tiger economy, to use a familiar phrase, Ireland is now in a financial position to increase this contribution further towards the UN recommended level of 0.45 per cent of GDP. I regret that when this Government took over the reins a new attitude was adopted. The 1999 Book of Estimates showed some shocking reductions in budgets for relief and development in Third World countries. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who put her position on the line to have the budgets increased, managed only to secure cash limits for ODA expenditure over the next three years. As pointed out in the House by our spokesperson on finance, Deputy McDowell, the reality of setting cash limits means that our overall contribution to ODA will fall from the current level of approximately 0.33 per cent of GDP to as low as 0.225 per cent or 0.23 per cent of GDP. In an economy such as ours, which is set to continue to grow into the next century, this position is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Against this backdrop we know that ESAF can have damaging implications for many developing nations. Where there is a clear will among the people to support developing nations, I do not see any need to support this Bill. Instead of supporting a subscription to ESAF, we, as a national Parliament, should vote to give more of our budget to development and relief work where it is most needed. The tried and trusted practice of donating money and support to countries where there is a genuine crisis should not be scuppered. Ireland has built up a relationship over many years with countries where, because of war, climatic conditions, natural disasters and oppression, there is consistent poverty. There is no reason we should break this relationship by turning to a new form of so-called support.</P>
    <P>In representations made to me by many of the organisations who carry out relief work, it has been brought to my attention that some ESAF programmes are produced without any reference to civil society and are undemocratically negotiated without reference to any elected parliament. Is the Minister concerned about this type of development?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil made a pre-election commitment to the effect that it would continue to withhold funding from ESAF. There is no basis for any U-turn in terms of Government commitment to ESAF and I ask the Minister to clarify the position without further delay in the interests of social justice and the stable development of some of the most disadvantaged nations in the world.</P>
    <P>The Government should reconsider its position on the Bill. As Deputy De Rossa said, it should consider withdrawing it so that there can be consensus in this Parliament on how we should meet our obligations to Third World countries and other countries in need of our assistance. Direct assistance from us might be more beneficial than this enhanced structural adjustment facility of the IMF.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am totally opposed to the Bill and the Government should withdraw it. It seeks to tie in this State with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the major agencies which dictate the terms and conditions of loans to the poorest countries in the world.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a logical outcome of the thinking in the Department of Foreign Affairs for many years. It is not accidental. The White Paper on foreign policy, published some years ago, states: &ldquo;The heavy burden of debt carried by many developing countries is a major issue for the international community which needs to be tackled at global level&rdquo;. It goes on to state: &ldquo;The Government [this was brought in under the Government in which Deputy Spring was Minister for Foreign Affairs] will support the efforts being made by the international financial institutions to resolve the problem through our membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund&rdquo;. That was a clear statement that it is to those institutions one should turn to deal with the catastrophic problem of indebtedness in the poorest countries of the world.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to provide money for multilateral debt relief through the World Bank and the IMF and commit moneys to the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the IMF. What is the International Monetary Fund? In 1994, its managing director likened the IMF to a friendly international credit union. The record shows that the opposite is the case. The IMF and the World Bank, in the experience of the poor of the Third World who have been crushed by the savage conditions imposed along with their loans, would be regarded more as loan sharks rather than the local friendly credit union. They dress up their programmes in fancy names &ndash; the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the IMF. It may sound impressive but what is ESAF? It is a vicious programme of conditions put on the indebted countries as a result of the loans they have from the powerful institutions of the west.</P>
      <P>This programme involves the ruthless reduction of government deficits, savage cuts in public spending and sweeping privatisation of publicly owned institutions. The fancy name of restructuring means a trail of destruction when it comes to the living standards and the quality of life of the poor who are at the mercy of these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South Korea, for example, coincidental with the crisis of capitalism in south-east Asia, was subjected to the tender mercies of the IMF and its restructuring programmes. What was the result? In 1998, unemployment in South Korea more than doubled to approximately two million in a country where unemployment and other welfare benefits are almost non-existent. Tens of thousands of migrant workers who were essential to the economy of South Korea in its Asian tiger phase were unceremoniously booted out of South Korea. They had to go back to the poverty they had previously experienced in Pakistan, India, the <Col N="538" /> Philippines, Vietnam and other poor countries. As far as the working class in South Korea is concerned, it meant dire poverty and homelessness to an acute degree.</P>
    <P>The loans given under the aegis of the IMF to the tune of almost $60 billion were not given in an impartial fashion for the well-being of either the peoples or the capitalists of Korea. Through the aegis of the IMF, the major international banks and industrial conglomerates of the west broke rival companies in South Korea and opened up the markets to American and Western goods. The main interest of the IMF is to defend the interests of the American, European and Japanese banks.</P>
    <P>The IMF insisted on drastically high borrowing rates in South Korea. In January of 1988 alone, it drove 3,000 indebted Korean companies into bankruptcy, thereby creating the conditions where Western companies could take more of the market. It is a ruthless operation which fits in with the nature of global capitalism, serviced by the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
    <P>In October 1998, Oxfam released a report which was a damning indictment of IMF policies in Asia, outlining how it has drastically exacerbated the economic crisis in south east Asia.</P>
    <P>There was a dramatic collapse of 20 per cent in gross domestic product in Indonesia. The victims were the low income workers in the cities and the rural poor. By the end of last year, 100 million Indonesians were living below the poverty line &ndash; four times the total in 1996. Food prices had risen dramatically, hunger had escalated, child malnutrition increased and children dropped out of school in their hundreds of thousands. No wonder Oxfam said the IMF prioritised the claims of commercial bank creditors in the United States over the social and economic needs of Indonesia with devastating implications for poverty. Its priority could not be any clearer.</P>
    <P>The report states that the United States has linked its $460 million to Indonesia to the purchase of American cotton, soya beans, flour, wheat and corn. Australia has provided financing in the same areas, as much to protect its market share as to meet the real needs of the Indonesian economy. This is the real agenda of the IMF, the World Bank and the Western agencies which dominate and dictate the policies of those institutions.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that the White Paper states that this Government will support the efforts being made by the international financial institutions to resolve problems through our membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in spite of the glaring evidence of what those institutions mean for the people of these countries.</P>
    <P>Every country in the developing world has its own story. Oxfam examined the IMF programme in the Philippines, which was described as imposing stringent financial discipline on the Philippine economy. What was the result? Drastic cuts in public health programmes. The prevent<Col N="539" /> ative health care budget for malaria was slashed by 27 per cent, the result of which was an estimated 29,000 extra deaths from malaria per year in the Philippines. The preventative health care budget for tuberculosis was slashed by 36 per cent. That should strike a chord with our people, considering our experience of the tragedy of tuberculosis only a few decades ago. The result was 90,000 extra untreated cases of tuberculosis. The litany goes on: 500,000 children losing their vitamin A supplements, 750,000 not receiving the iodine supplements essential to their health. These programmes impact on the men, women and children of those countries unfortunate enough to find themselves in the grip of the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
    <P>Far from resolving the problems of the Third World, these institutions create more poverty, deprivation and suffering as a result of the harsh terms they implement. Their programmes are causing more and more serious problems. Recently Nicaragua and Honduras endured horrific floods and hurricane conditions. These were explained away as natural disasters. There is an element of natural disaster but the consequences of the hurricane and the flooding are increased one hundred fold as a result of the policies of the IMF and the World Bank, because of the impact on the environment of what the people of poor countries are forced to do to survive. The horrific death toll in Honduras and Nicaragua was increased as a result of the mud slides caused by the deforestation of the countryside as the rural poor were forced to cut down the vegetation to survive. Those two countries are sunk in debt to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>Africa has been ravaged by the west for hundreds of years since the dark days of slavery when its people were dragged in chains to America and elsewhere, the tragic obscenity of colonialism. Now there is colonialism in a new form &ndash; the slavery of debt imposed by the World Bank and its agent the IMF. The foreign debt of sub-Saharan Africa now stands at $235 billion. More goes out in debt servicing per annum than is available to meet the basic needs of health, education, food, water and sanitation. That is blind piracy of resources taken from the mouths of the poorest of the poor to bloat the already bloated profits of Western banks and financial institutions.</P>
    <P>It is not as if these agencies did not know the results of their policies. The World Bank said of Zambia that 70 per cent of the people lived below a line of absolute poverty and yet in Zambia last year, more went on servicing its massive debt than on all health and education programmes combined. In a 1995 survey the World Bank found that 800 million people go hungry daily and stated the figure will increase. On current trends, the World Bank claims that by the year 2000, 1.3 billion people will be expected to survive on less than $1 a day. These are the people targeted by the IMF and the World Bank for the massive interest payments and vicious programme of cuts <Col N="540" /> in the most basic health care and education programmes. These are the poor, leeched on by international financial institutions, to whom this Government wants the State to cause more suffering. The backbreaking labour and poverty of hundreds of millions of poor people go, not to feed themselves or to provide security, shelter or a better quality of life for their families, but to bloat the profits of international institutions. The debt initiatives of the IMF and the World Bank are not intended to alleviate that poverty and suffering; the direct result of their policies is to maintain the enslavement of the world's poorest people. That is shameful in the extreme and not something of which the Irish people would wish to be a part.</P>
    <P>The alternative is the cancellation of the debt, and I stand for that cancellation. We must, however, be realistic. Will the financial vultures who control the international banking system cancel the debt? One might as well ask a hyena to part with its carrion. They will keep their claws deeply embedded in the flesh of the poor people of the Third World until they get every last drop of blood.</P>
    <P>This Bill should not just be booted out of sight; I hope the Minister withdraws it in light of the arguments made. Appeals to the heartless bankers and financiers of the world will not sort out the terrible suffering of the people of the Third World. A revolution of people power from the millions of oppressed and downtrodden against the dictatorships that have abused and enslaved them in this debt is necessary. A dictatorship of global capitalism dictates the debt and its terms. The poor of the Third World should not appeal to the IMF, the World Bank or the bosses of global capitalism. They should appeal to, and join with, the organised working classes and poor of the West, so that we can rise to dictate to Governments and international banking institutions that human need comes before the greed of these institutions.</P>

      <P>This measure represents the most significant change in this country's policy on the developing world for many years. This proposal will officially put this country and the Government at variance with the position of many voluntary agencies and non-governmental organisations that have worked tirelessly over the years to collect money, to send volunteers to the developing world, to develop programmes and to encourage and work with the Government to make a real contribution towards the developing world. It will also put the Government at variance with the policy enunciated for many years by Ireland in relation to the developing world. Remarkably, it is a measure that is even at variance with Fianna Fáil's pre-election commitments to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish people have repeatedly shown interest in, and enthusiasm for, projects in the developing world. They have put their hands in their pockets when emergencies arise and they have a sense of <Col N="541" /> fairness towards those parts of the world which are less developed and less fortunate than Ireland. A large part of our current prosperity rests on their underdevelopment. In this measure, the Government is betraying the trust of many Irish people and is failing to give the leadership that is expected in relation to overseas development aid and debt repayment.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Bill is being taken by the Minister for Finance. It is remarkable that a measure, which is essentially one of development aid, traditionally the preserve of the Department of Foreign Affairs, where it has been handled remarkably well over the years, is now being piloted through the House by the Department of Finance. That shows the commitment this country has traditionally given to gradually increase our share of gross national product for overseas development aid is being abandoned. In the past year the commitment to increase the share of GNP for overseas development aid has been abandoned. The same applies to the commitment given by Fianna Fáil before the election that, in office, it would endeavour to reach the target of 0.45 per cent by 2002.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister for Finance has insisted that cash limits be put on the amount of overseas development aid. The apparent logic is that it is too generous, at a time of economic growth, to commit ourselves to a share of GNP and that increases in GNP for overseas development aid mean more and more money will be given to overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>That is the point of expressing overseas development aid as a share of GNP and was the logic behind the approach adopted by the United Nations which Ireland supported. The logic was that the more prosperous countries would give more generously towards overseas development aid and as a country's prosperity increased so too would its financial, moral and political responsibility towards the developing world. It is shameful that this Government is doing an about-turn on that commitment and is, effectively, reversing the share of GNP that will go towards overseas development aid. Figures were announced earlier this year in response to the spat between the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development and the Minister for Finance. Those figures which superficially appeared to resolve an internal political conflict in the Government will inevitably mean, even with modest economic growth, the share of GNP will gradually reduce.</P>
    <P>By the time this Government leaves office &ndash; if it lasts its full term, which is becoming increasingly doubtful &ndash; the level of aid will be back down to where it was in the early 1990s. For a country enjoying increased economic prosperity and growth, which has always sought to give a certain degree of moral and political leadership in the international community on ODA, that is shameful.</P>
    <P>It is also shameful that the measure before us, which was rejected by the previous Government <Col N="542" /> as a means of addressing the debt problem in the developing world, is being reintroduced by this Government. I strongly support the amendment tabled by the Labour Party to the Second Stage of the Bill. The Government is essentially supporting the IMF approach to debt repayment, which is market driven. Its assessment of the economies of developing and beneficiary countries is made on the basis of conservative and traditional economic indicators. No account is taken by the IMF of the human and social conditions or the extent of poverty in the countries concerned. Essentially, the IMF's objective is to keep the southern hemisphere safe for capitalism, to maintain stability for the global market economy in the developing world, not to address poverty and the underprovision of health and education or to use the resources of the richer part of the world to lift people and enable them to lift themselves out of their appalling trap. Our prosperity in this part of the world is due to a large extent to the fact that we benefit from the exploitation of poor people in developing countries. The economic tools and measures in our prosperous and thriving economies are inappropriate for those countries.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government is doing a <i>volte face</i> on traditional Irish policy on ODA and abandoning the many organisations, NGOs, voluntary groups, and individuals who have worked tirelessly over the years to develop an overall Irish ODA programme and a significant contribution to the developing world. It is a betrayal of the people who have been working in that area. It is also a further demonstration that what Fianna Fáil says on the eve of an election bears no relationship to what it does when it gets the reins of power. In many cases, the party's hope and expectation is that it will get away with it, that a Bill ostensibly introduced as a financial measure by the Minister for Finance, titled in obscure terms, will not attract the attention of the public. However, there is a keen awareness among the people that the measure before the House, which the Government is attempting to slip through, represents a significant retrograde step in our approach to ODA. People are ashamed of it and in the course of time they will let the members of the Government parties know their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the interesting and thought provoking interventions they made on this important legislation. This Bill marks a departure &ndash; it represents the first occasion when the Government of Ireland will participate with its multilateral partners in the provision of debt relief to those deserving countries in the Third World whose development is being constrained by the crippling burden of debt. I have grouped the themes touched on by Deputies and will respond to them under the following headings: policy principles on Third World debt; the performance of the main actors in HIPC implementation; the preferred economic model of the IMF; instruments of debt <Col N="543" /> relief; the process and model of development; EU participation in the HIPC debt initiative; participation and consultation with civil society; focus and volume of Ireland's ODA budget; and specific points of clarification, including the BIS facility, the Cologne debt initiative and aggregation clauses.</P>
      <P>I detect from the House a strong sense that it is broadly supportive of the principles the Government has announced concerning Irish Third World debt policy. It is clear Deputies agree that debt relief should become an integral part of Ireland's overall overseas development aid strategy. Deputies also emphasised the importance of the fundamental goal of poverty elimination, which must be achieved in a manner consistent with environmental sustainability and gender equality. The World Bank itself has indicated:</P>
      <P>debt relief should be seen as an integral part of the broader development agenda, and integrated into an overall strategy of poverty alleviation. A key element of all strategies to reduce poverty must be a well-specified plan of reform in countries, which has broad political support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies stressed their concern that the IMF, in particular, would need to take human development indicators into account in designing its programmes. The Government has already incorporated this concept into its principles on Third World debt and I will continue to advocate these approaches in the course of my ongoing dialogue with the fund.</P>
      <P>The commentaries of Deputies in regard to the main actors in the debt relief process are mixed. It is clear that, overall, this House strongly endorses the type of approaches adopted by the World Bank and, in particular, the International Development Association in regard to the alleviation of debt in the Third World. That social sector expenditures are taken into account in the design of their programmes has been favourably acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By contrast, the IMF is not held in the same esteem. In fact the House has been strongly critical of the fund for a variety of reasons. It is perceived to be aloof, removed, authoritarian, and uncaring in the manner in which it plans, designs, and implements its programmes. This message must be conveyed to the IMF. Even if it is based on an incomplete appreciation of all the facts or false perceptions, nevertheless the clear message coming to me from this debate is that the International Monetary Fund needs to become more customer friendly and more in tune with the needs of developing countries and to engage more effectively with civil society. It is also perceived as being uncaring in regard to the social impacts of its policies, although it should be noted <Col N="544" /> that the deputy managing director of the fund hotly contested this in a recent address.</P>
    <P>The private sector, including the international banking community, is also seen by Deputies as having contributed to the creation of the debt crisis in the first instance. I agree that the international community must find ways to ensure the private sector bears an appropriate share in preventing and resolving future financial crises.</P>
    <P>The IMF has been singled out for criticism for the model of economic development that it pursues. The so-called &ldquo;Washington Consensus Model&rdquo;&ndash; the &ldquo;Milton Friedman Model&rdquo; as it has been characterised in this House &ndash; stands accused of favouring certain types of political and economic ideologies to the detriment of the Third World. I can understand where some of these sentiments come from, but let us not get too carried away by sentiment. There is much in the Washington Consensus Model that has stood Ireland in good stead and should not be decried and dismissed out of hand. To achieve improved economic performance, countries must follow sound macroeconomic and structural adjustment policies, pursue appropriate industrial and inward investment policies, adopt open trading relationships and facilitate the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. It goes without saying that such policies must be underpinned by appropriate social safety nets and social inclusion policies and must be predicated on appropriate consultation with and participation of civil society. Good governance and the rule of law are also critical underpinnings for successful economic and social development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy. However, it is clear that the economic model which the IMF employs must be adapted to take account of local conditions, local cultures and particularly the stage of development of the country concerned. The old fashioned approaches which suggested a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; policy prescription is no longer sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the instruments for alleviating debt, the clear message coming from the House is that the HIPC debt initiative as currently constructed does not go far enough. The <i>cri de coeur</i> coming from the House is well made, well motivated and appropriate in light of the crisis these countries are suffering. There is clear recognition that the debt initiative in itself represents a significant step forward, but clearly it does not extend as far as most Members would like. The Government is <Col N="545" /> prepared to engage in a rational debate on the whole issue of debt cancellation. The full implications of such a move, particularly in relation to multilateral debt, will have to be considered in detail. The particular needs of the middle income countries and the effect such cancellation would have on the funding capacity of the IMF and the World Bank would have to be fully teased out. As far as bilateral debt is concerned, there is growing support for more extensive relief, including cancellation, and I can support this.</P>
    <P>I note, with satisfaction, that the Cologne Debt Initiative put forward by Chancellor Schröder is to be put before the G7 members for approval soon and that US Vice President Al Gore has signalled a shift in US policy on the matter of debt relief. Evidence is now emerging that the international community is actively engaging in the debt cancellation debate and is prepared to move forward from strongly held positions of the past. I will continue to press the international community, the IMF and the World Bank to provide the deepest possible level of debt relief to HIPC countries who are prepared to engage in appropriate economic and social reform programmes. However, it must be recognised that the degree of funding to be provided by donors is the critical determinant of the level of debt relief that will be made available in the final analysis. Hence the need for Ireland and this House to approve the debt relief package contained in the Bretton Woods Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding ESAF, the instruments through which the international financial institutions make their contributions to the debt initiative have also come in for criticism. The ESAF is singled out for particular odium. It is not my intention to stand here in defence of the IMF's programme as such, but equally it is completely unfair to visit all the woes of Africa on the IMF and the enhanced structural adjustment facility. A single factor analysis of the crisis of Africa is inadequate and does not do justice to the complexity and diversity of challenges facing the region. I would also remind Deputies that our contribution to ESAF at this juncture is to endorse and encourage the changes for which we have been calling and which are now being embarked on. For example, in the area of the social impact of adjustment, the external evaluators argued that reform programmes should take into account more detailed and systematic analysis on the likely impact of specific reforms on the poor. In this area, the evaluators suggested that the IMF should rely on the expertise of the World Bank.</P>
    <P>Work is now under way to develop ex-ante social assessments of specific adjustment policies and integrate the findings into programme design, including in the design of well targeted social safety nets. Initially, the focus on this work is on six pilot cases in which staff of the IMF and the World Bank are collaborating closely. Thereafter, the lessons gained could be used to extend the coverage of this work in the design of all adjust<Col N="546" /> ment programmes supported by the ESAF. In addition to this work in pilot cases, IMF staff have been called upon to strengthen their analysis of the social content of all ESAF supported programmes, including the quality of public spending, in collaboration with the World Bank and other agencies. These are welcome initiatives.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke on the myriad of causes that have led to the present difficulties. The 1998 Human Development Report indicated the main causes of poverty in Africa, affecting about 45 per cent of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa are economic stagnation, slow employment growth, increasing income disparities, the lack of socially balanced economic growth, marginalisation from global trade and financial flows, high fertility, the spread of HIV/AIDS, degradation of natural resources, and the consequences of violent conflict, including displacement of people and violation of human rights.</P>
    <P>Deputies have also adverted to gross economic mismanagement and corruption, the excesses of dictators, white elephant infrastructural projects and the lack of well developed democratic structures as being at the root cause of the debt crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that it would be unfair and a misrepresentation to saddle ESAF with the entire woes of Africa. Clearly a multiplicity of actors must severally shoulder the blame.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations in his report to the Security Council on the Causes of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa in April 1998 indicated that Africa had begun to make significant economic and political progress in recent years but in many parts of the continent progress remains threatened or impeded by conflict. The Secretary General's analysis of the historical legacy shows that the colonial history in Africa, the establishment of frequently artificial states drawn from disparate communities, economic production to meet requirements of colonial powers and interference in Africa for ideological reasons have all contributed to the underdevelopment of the continent. Clearly we need to engage with Africa on a wide variety of dimensions. We must adopt a multifaceted approach in partnership with the regions concerned to address the most significant challenges ahead. The best model that we can point to with credibility is the proposed successor to the Lóme IV Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ongoing negotiations regarding successor arrangements for the present Lóme Convention, the EU has made far-reaching proposals for new global partnership with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which include three components; political dialogue, support for development, and economic and trade co-operation. The EU will adopt a supportive role in the preservation of a political environment conducive to peace. The <Col N="547" /> eradication of poverty has to be the central concern, to be achieved through more sustained development and greater competitiveness as well as the development of the private sector, and improved access to social services.</P>
    <P>As regards trade and economic co-operation, the EU proposals aim at progressively transforming the old form of trade co-operation limited to a system of preferences into a real economic partnership. The EU proposal is to negotiate partnership agreements covering free trade areas and an enhanced co-operation in trade related matters, including intellectual property rights, competition policy, investment protection and promotion etc., with such groupings that are engaged in a regional integration process. The EU is proposing to manage the process with a maximum of flexibility. Ireland has been among the strong supporters in the EU for developing a regime for the least developed countries that will mean that by 2000 virtually all imports from these countries will enter the EU free of duties.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been actively engaged with the European Union in the context of its participation in the HIPC initiative. Ireland has strongly pressed for an early engagement by the European Union in the initiative and this is taking place. We also strongly advocated participation by the European Investment Bank in the debt initiative and I am glad to report to the House that the president of the bank has now concluded that there are no legal obstacles in the way of the bank doing so. This is a welcome development. It underlines the multilateral context of the initiative and the importance of ensuring that each actor bears its proportionate share of the burden.</P>
    <P>Other general themes picked up by Deputies are issues of the transparency of the International Monetary Fund, the role of civil society and, in particular, its participation in the development, design and implementation of the IMF and World Bank programmes.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record the substantial progress made by the president of the World Bank under the strategic compact to implement such principles in so far as the World Bank is concerned. The same cannot be said of the International Monetary Fund. It is time that the fund adopted more consultative, participative and co-operative approaches both in regard to the programmes it supports, including ESAF, and also in regard to the wider community of interests which it serves. Free market liberalism without adequate controls and social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable people in society is no longer a viable option.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the question of Ireland's official development assistance, ODA.  Total ODA will rise from £137 million in 1998 to £158 million this year. On the basis of the best estimates currently available ODA will increase in the year 2000 to £173 million and in 2001 to £196 million. Thus, in this three year period ODA will increase by £59 million or 43 per cent. On the <Col N="548" /> bilateral aid programme, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and I have reached agreement on a multi-annual basis for funding the programme through the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. In 1999 the budget will amount to over £104 million. In 2000 it will increase to £136.4 million. In 2001 it will amount to £159.2 million. The scale of the increase is perhaps best appreciated by pointing out that the relevant subheads in 1992, only seven years ago, amounted to £23 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the issue of the Government's intention of reaching an interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP on the way to the ultimate UN target of 0.7 per cent ODA to GNP. We remain committed to both &ndash; to reaching the interim target in the life of the Government and to making progress toward the UN target. However, a priority to which we must also give attention, against this background of unparalleled GNP growth, is the need for our aid to grow in a planned way, in keeping with capacity in our programme and especially in line with our reputation for delivering quality aid. We are committed to delivering substantial, steady growth of ODA, without making any compromises in terms of quality. Ours is a planned, manageable growth strategy.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to note that Deputy McDowell has expressed support for Chancellor Schröder's Cologne debt initiative. This initiative represents a significant step forward for Germany in regard to the issue of third world debt. I am, however, surprised by the inconsistency in Deputy McDowell's position which finds expression in support for Chancellor Schröder's initiative while maintaining a position of opposition to Ireland's debt relief package. The elements of both packages are identical, subject to two important caveats. Germany has bilateral ODA and commercial debts with the third world which it now proposes should be considered for cancellation as part of a group effort under the aegis of the Paris Club. Ireland has minimal obligations under the Paris Club. We have always welcomed and encouraged efforts towards debt cancellation under the Paris Club.</P>
    <P>Chancellor Schröder's initiative corresponds directly with the Irish initiative in that it contains express commitments on the part of the German government to work towards the alleviation of multilateral debt by making significant contributions to the World Bank's HIPC trust fund and also commits itself to funding the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the IMF. I should add that Ireland has always gone beyond Germany in regard to the sale of gold by the International Monetary Fund and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised very specific questions in regard to the continuing justification of Irish participation in the BIS facility in favour of Brazil. EU involvement in the BIS facility was initiated by the Austrian Presidency under the First Pillar of the European Union, acting through the ECOFIN Council, and not under the <Col N="549" /> aegis of the common foreign and security policy. Ironically, the form of participation is inter-governmental rather than being institutionally or European Union based. Individual member states accepts full responsibility for their own participation in the facility, although each is conscious that its involvement was initiated by the Presidency to show European Union solidarity with an external country experiencing economic difficulty. The fact that the Union's procedures are sufficiently flexible and robust to allow for such forms of co-operation must be seen as a strength. However, the Deputy is correct in stating that this development creates a precedent, a welcome one from my perspective, and one which will need to be formalised over time. Participation in the facility by EU member states is still justified on the basis that it is essential that confidence be restored in the Brazilian economy without delay.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised concerns about the inclusion of a number of aggregation clauses in the Bill. The suggestion is that such mechanisms are a ruse to bypass the House. This is a misinterpretation I would like to correct. Such aggregation clauses are frequently used as a control mechanism under various legislative codes to ensure that the relevant Minister must come before the Oireachtas for specific approval to move beyond certain specified expenditure levels. They are intended to provide a degree of flexibility, with the consent of the Oireachtas, but equally to limit this flexibility. They are, therefore, moves in the direction of, rather than away from, Oireachtas accountability. Such provisions should not be misconstrued as efforts to prevent the Oireachtas from availing of other mechanisms to review the activities of the Bretton Woods institutions on a regular basis. I propose to move an amendment on Committee Stage to facilitate the Oireachtas in this important task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche and others spoke eloquently on the need for express accountability to the Oireachtas in respect of Ireland's participation in the Bretton Woods institutions. Their points were well made. My intention is to satisfy this request by moving an amendment on Committee Stage to include an annual reporting mechanism to the Oireachtas in respect of Ireland's engagement in <Col N="550" /> the Bretton Woods institutions. The provision of an annual report would allow the various joint committees the opportunity to review annually the progress being made on key issues affecting the Third World, the newly industrialising countries, proposals to reform the international financial architecture as well as such facilities as the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the IMF.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill allows the Minister to make payments to the ESAF trust and the HIPC debt initiative trust fund. Section 6 allows the Minister to authorise the Central Bank to make payments on behalf of the Government to the HIPC trust. No provision is contained in the Bill to allow the Minister to make a payment direct to the HIPC trust. It would be important to remedy this deficiency on Committee Stage. It is, therefore, my intention to move an amendment to section 4 to allow the Minister to make unspecified payments to the ESAF-HIPC trust subject to an aggregate limit of £10 million. I should add that, while I have no immediate intention of making such a payment in the foreseeable future, an enabling provision would allow the Government to decide to deepen its financial contribution to multilateral debt relief.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the in-depth contributions they made on this important debate. The Bill before the House represents a carefully balanced package of assistance for debt alleviation in the Third World. It is particularly important that Ireland plays its role and shoulders its proportionate part of the financial costs of the international co-operative efforts being made to alleviate debt. These are part of a wider framework of development efforts to secure the economic and social development of the HIPC countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. Deputies were strongly of the view that, given our new-found economic standing, Ireland should use its voice assertively in the international arena on behalf of the developing and less well-off countries. I could not agree more. Such a responsibility can no longer be considered as an option, it has indeed become a moral imperative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is important and far-reaching legislation which puts in place an organisational structure to deliver a more integrated, efficient and patient-focused health service for the people of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The need for radical structural reform in the health services in the eastern region has been recognised for some time. The existing organisational structure is no longer suitable for the size of the region it serves and the scale and complexity of the issues with which it deals.</P>
      <P>In the 30 year period between 1966 and 1996 the population in the Eastern Health Board area increased by 41 per cent. Some 11 per cent of that increase has occurred since 1981 and the population is expected to increase still further in the next few decades. At present, it stands at 1.3 million people compared with the populations of the other health boards which range between 200,000 and 0.5 million people. The size of the board's population, coupled with the fact that most of the acute hospital care in the region is outside its remit, has made it difficult for the Eastern Health Board to achieve a strong sense of identity among the community it serves.</P>
      <P>The years since the board's establishment have also seen a marked increase in the range and extent of social problems, such as drug abuse, child abuse and homelessness, which have become part of its remit. The acute hospital services in the region have also come under pressure over the years with ever-increasing demands for services. High levels of deprivation occur in many parts of the region. It has been predicted that the inner city and the rapidly enlarging and gradually ageing suburban population will make substantially heavier demands on the local health services as we move into the next century. Anyone with a knowledge of the complexity of the health services will recognise that although funding will always be an important issue, throwing money at all these problems is not the full answer. We need to organise the services in a more efficient and effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several expert reports over the years have highlighted the need for radical organisational reform of the structures in the eastern region so that the services can respond effectively to the <Col N="554" /> challenges they face. The core problems identified by successive reports are the absence of a single authority with responsibility for planning the delivery and co-ordination of all services for the region; over-centralised decision-making within the health board; the lack of an appropriate management structure at district level, given the increase in population over the past 30 years; and the need for better communication and co-operation between the voluntary sector and the health board.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to tackle all these problems. Its primary and overriding objective is to achieve real improvements in the health and personal social services delivered to patients, clients and service users in the eastern region. The new authority and the three area health boards established by this Bill will enable the delivery of health and personal social services to be brought closer to the people. Decisions regarding the provision of local services will be made closer to the point of delivery and, through the involvement of local councillors on each area health board, more involvement by local communities in the planning and organisation of their health services will be made possible.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to ensure in a more accurate and accountable way than is possible at present that the £1.2 billion now spent annually on the health services in the eastern region provides the best possible value for money for the taxpayer. Under the terms of this Bill, all service provision within the eastern region, whether the service provider is a statutory body or a voluntary agency, will be on the basis of a written, legally binding service agreement between the authority and the service provider.</P>
    <P>Service agreements will facilitate better planning, better budgeting and more accountability at all levels of the services. They will ensure a degree of continuity and financial security for providers, on the one hand, and will ensure that the use of public funds can be fully accounted for, on the other. The Bill requires the authority and each area health board to put in place systems, procedures and practices to monitor and evaluate all the services provided on their behalf.</P>
    <P>This Bill follows closely the recommendations of the task force on the eastern regional health authority, which submitted its report to me at the end of June 1997. The task force consulted widely with all the various interests involved in the course of preparing its report. Meetings and discussions were held with many of the principal parties, including the members of the board and the management of the Eastern Health Board, the owners and management of the voluntary hospitals, the voluntary agencies and organisations providing services to persons with a mental handicap and some staff associations. The task force is continuing with its work, preparing the ground for a smooth transition to the new structures.</P>
    <P>The new authority proposed by this Bill will replace the Eastern Health Board as the statutory <Col N="555" /> body with responsibility for the health services, but its focus will be significantly different from that of the current Eastern Health Board. It will be required to focus on the strategic planning of services for the region in response to identified and measured need; the commissioning of services from the statutory and voluntary sectors; and overseeing and evaluating the services provided.</P>
    <P>This will be a body charged with examining the health needs of its population as a whole, ranging over all the health services: health promotion and disease prevention; primary care, acute hospital care and community care, including personal social services, in both the voluntary and statutory sectors. It will carry out its functions in the context of the objectives of the health strategy maximising health and social gain; addressing inequalities in health status; tackling the main causes of premature death; promoting good health; preventing disease; treating the sick and helping families and individuals to deal with personal social problems. In its allocation of resources, it will be charged with responsibility for deciding priorities on the basis of those parameters and with ensuring efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority will present us with an unprecedented opportunity to develop a comprehensive, cohesive and integrated health system in the eastern region. It will have the potential to deliver real benefits to the people in the long-term, by bringing about a re-orientation of the services, so that all services are integrated around the patient and are seamless in the perception of the user.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of the sort of improvement I hope this reorganisation will help to bring about. Take an elderly patient who is under the care of her general practitioner, who needs urgent geriatric care in a voluntary acute hospital. On discharge from hospital she might require convalescent care provided by the statutory services, followed by some time in a private nursing home. Finally she may be allowed home, with domiciliary support provided by the statutory services and attendance at a voluntary day hospital.</P>
    <P>Each one of the components of health care received by this not untypical patient is managed, staffed and organised by different sets of people, with different training, protocols and procedures. However, if our imaginary patient can move through the sequence easily, without delay, and if her perception is that she is receiving a unified, comprehensive and seamless service, then the system is working. The positive experience of that elderly patient is the one I want to have available in future to all the people who use the health services in the eastern region. That will be one of the key criteria by which the authority will be judged.</P>
    <P>The delivery of statutory services in the new structure will be the responsibility of the three area health boards established by the Bill. The Northern Area Health Board, the South-Western <Col N="556" /> Area Health Board and the East Coast Area Health Boards will each have responsibility for the delivery within their own areas of the services currently being provided by the Eastern Health Board. They will also plan and co-ordinate all services within their areas, in co-operation with the local voluntary service providers.</P>
    <P>I would envisage these area health boards operating to all intents and purposes as health boards in their own right, but within an overall policy and financial framework laid down by the central Authority. Each area health board will elect its own chairman and vice chairman and will hold its meetings in accordance with the rules which apply to all health boards. Each area health board will have its own chief executive, who will manage the statutory services within the board's functional area. This will allow the area health boards to focus more closely than is possible in the present structure on issues which affect their own local communities.</P>
    <P>A unique characteristic of the health services in the eastern region is that, to a greater extent than elsewhere in the country, a very significant proportion of the services are provided by voluntary hospitals and agencies, at present funded directly by my Department and with no formal links with the health board. It is accepted that this direct funding of voluntary providers by my Department has impeded the proper co-ordination and development of services at local level. In particular, it has hampered the development of linkages between community and hospital services and between voluntary and statutory services &ndash; linkages which are essential to the development of coherent, integrated responses to important health care issues such as care of the elderly.  This Bill addresses that situation by bringing about a major change in the funding arrangements for the voluntary hospitals and agencies in the eastern region. The introduction, under this Bill, of service agreements between the authority and the major voluntary providers means that the voluntary sector will be formally tied into the overall services in the region for the first time. The proposals will allow the voluntary hospitals and agencies to retain their operational autonomy, while making them fully accountable for the public funds that they receive.</P>
    <P>I emphasise at this point, as I did on the publication of this Bill, that there is no intention on the part of the Department or the Government to &ldquo;take over&rdquo; the voluntary hospitals, by way of this Bill or by any other means. The health strategy, published in 1994, made it clear that the independent identity of the voluntary providers would be fully respected in the new structures and this Bill delivers on that promise. As I have said before, the challenge for the authority and its management will be to develop an ethos of partnership between statutory and voluntary providers, with the shared objective of delivering a fully integrated service to patients and clients, and to develop the requisite level of co-operation <Col N="557" /> between professionals and between agencies to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The challenge for the voluntary sector will be to demonstrate, particularly through good governance and management, that it can continue to deliver the required level of services in a sensitive, caring and cost effective manner. I believe the best guarantee of continuing autonomy into the long-term future is the excellence of governance and management in the provider agencies and their ability to participate fully in the planning and review of services.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the main provisions of the Bill. This Bill is divided into six parts: Part I deals with preliminary matters; Part II deals with the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority; Part III with the establishment of the three area health boards, Part IV with the dissolution of the Eastern Health Board; Part V with the establishment of the health boards executive and Part VI with the amendment of other Acts.</P>
    <P>In Part I, section 3 provides that the Minister shall by order appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act, that is, the day on which the authority and the area health boards will come into being.</P>
    <P>Section 5 allows the Minister to amend the First and Second Schedules to the Bill. The First Schedule sets out the boundaries of the three area health boards. The Minister may amend the boundaries after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the local authority concerned. The Second Schedule is a list of the voluntary hospitals and agencies which are currently funded directly by my Department. The Minister is empowered to amend this Schedule, but he must consult with a voluntary body before deleting its name from the list.  I will return to the significance of this provision later.  </P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Section 7 establishes the authority as a body corporate and defines its functional area, which will correspond to that of the existing Eastern Health Board. It provides that any reference in any enactment to a health board shall be interpreted as including a reference to the authority. This is a simple legal device which allows the authority to take on all the legal powers and duties of a health board. Elsewhere in the Bill some of these powers are delegated to the area health boards.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the functions of the authority. These will consist of the existing functions of a health board and the new statutory functions of planning, arranging for and overseeing the provision of all health and personal social services in the region.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the task force's report was that a clear division should be established in the new structures between the funding of the services and their delivery. Accordingly, the authority will not be involved itself in the direct provision of services. Instead, it is required to make arrangements for the pro<Col N="558" /> vision of services with the three area health boards and the voluntary service providers. This section also requires the authority to co-ordinate the provision of services in its region; to put in place systems to monitor and evaluate the services provided and to have regard to the advice tendered by each of the three area health boards.</P>
    <P>The authority is required, in section 8(2)(d), to have regard to the right of voluntary bodies providing services to manage their own affairs in accordance with their independent ethos and traditions. This provision has been included in the Bill in response to the concerns of the voluntary hospitals and agencies providing services for the mentally handicapped that the new structures might in some way cut across their long cherished status as independent institutions.</P>
    <P>There will be no change under the new arrangements in the status or operation of any voluntary provider, whether an acute hospital, a mental handicap agency or other service provider. Their ownership will not change; their governing bodies, whether boards of management or trustees, will remain and retain all their functions, and there will be no change in the existing personnel and recruitment arrangements. Neither will the new arrangements interfere with the close co-operation between the universities and their associated hospitals. What will change is that the voluntary providers will be funded by the new authority instead of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Section 9 requires the authority to delegate its reserved functions in relation to service delivery to the three area health boards. Reserved functions are those functions performed directly by the members of the board. With a similar provision in section 17 dealing with executive functions, this provision will ensure responsibility for service delivery rests at area level. Where the authority decides that a certain function would be more efficiently performed in respect of the whole of the region by one area health board, this section allows it to delegate that function to one area health board.</P>
    <P>This section is an important provision. Its effect will be that the authority must adhere to its strategic functions. It cannot and ought not become a court of appeal or a forum in which operational decisions taken at area health board level are reopened for discussion. The authority's standing orders, which will be agreed by its members on its establishment, will have to reflect this important feature of its operation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 requires the Eastern Regional Health Authority to make arrangements, or service agreements as they are more commonly known, with service providers for the provision of services in its region. These arrangements will apply to the three area health boards as well as to the major voluntary service providers &ndash; that is, hospitals and mental handicap agencies &ndash; which are funded directly by my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The authority is required to make an arrangement with each area health board for the provision, within that board's area, of the services formerly provided by the Eastern Health Board. If it considers it appropriate to do so, the authority may terminate any part of a service agreement which it holds with an area health board and make an alternative arrangement with a voluntary body for the provision of the service concerned. The reverse can also happen, as the section allows the authority to make arrangements with area health boards for services other than those formerly provided by the Eastern Health Board, for example, new services or services formerly provided by a voluntary service provider.</P>
    <P>Every arrangement made under this section &ndash; whether with an area health board or a voluntary body &ndash; must consist of two parts: first, a long-term agreement of three to five years setting out the general principles by which both parties agree to abide and such other standards in relation to efficiency, effectiveness and quality as may be agreed between the parties and, second, an annual agreement specifying the services to be provided in respect of that year and the level of funding to be made available therefor. Voluntary bodies providing services in accordance with arrangements made under this section will be required to keep accounts in such form as may be approved by the authority.</P>
    <P>Under section 10(5), the authority may delegate the making of arrangements to the area health boards, except in cases where the arrangement is with another area health board or with one of the voluntary bodies listed in the Second Schedule. Deputies will recall that, under section 5, the Minister cannot remove a name from the Second Schedule without consulting the voluntary body concerned. This provision acts as a guarantee for the voluntary hospitals and agencies funded by my Department that they will be funded by the authority at central level, until and unless they decide that it is in their best interests to be funded by their local area health board.</P>
    <P>This provision does not mean the voluntary agencies can ignore or bypass the important work of local planning and co-ordination which will be done at area level. On the contrary, the service agreements negotiated by the authority with these voluntary bodies will specifically require them to co-operate with the management of the area health boards and to participate in whatever mechanisms are put in place for that purpose by the area chief executives.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for membership of the authority. In this section, I have followed the recommendations of the task force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority which offered a well thought-out and logical solution to a potentially contentious issue. In this context, the task force was constrained in its work by a number of parameters which had been laid down for it by the previous Government, and accepted by this <Col N="560" /> Government, including the requirement that public representatives hold a majority on the authority.</P>
    <P>This is a principle I fully endorse, because I do not want a democratic deficit to develop in the governance of the health service, a problem which has arisen in health services elsewhere. We must all accept that, once this rule of a majority of public representatives is applied, the scope for substantial numbers of other representatives on the authority is limited, unless we want a body of 100 members or more. This is an important point which has not been given due consideration by commentators.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has 38 members. Given that the inclusion of the voluntary hospitals will provide the new authority with a budget twice the size of that of the Eastern Health Board, the increase in membership from 38 to 55 is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Of the authority's 55 members, 30 will be public representatives, nominated by the six local authorities in the functional area of the authority. The remainder will be made up as follows: 13 members of registered professions &ndash; doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists &ndash; elected by their peers in the same numbers and in the same manner as currently applies to the Eastern Health Board; nine representatives of the voluntary service providers, appointed by the Minister and three ministerial nominees. Of the nine representatives of the voluntary service providers, the section provides that three will be nominated for appointment by persons or bodies the Minister considers representative of the voluntary hospitals, three by bodies representative of the voluntary mental handicap agencies and three by other voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, for a governing body, the size of the authority as proposed in the Bill is large. The challenge for the members of the authority will be to adopt, from the outset, working practices and processes which will take account of its size and which will ensure the overall task is broken down into sensible and manageable parts, enabling full use to be made of all the talents available among the membership. The mechanisms by which this might be achieved are being developed by the task force, so that concrete proposals can be put to the authority on its establishment.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment by the authority of a regional chief executive, pursuant to a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commission. It gives the regional chief executive all the powers of a health board chief executive officer, by providing that any reference in any enactment to the chief executive officer of a health board shall be interpreted as including a reference to the regional chief executive.</P>
    <P>The section provides that the Minister may appoint the first regional chief executive in advance of the establishment of the authority, for a period not exceeding three years. I am taking this power to ensure the planning and prep<Col N="561" /> aration for the new authority can get under way as soon as possible after the Bill has been enacted. The first regional chief executive will be an important influence in achieving a smooth transition to the new authority. A person of the highest calibre with the requisite leadership qualities and experience is required to be put in place as quickly as possible if the transition to the new structures is to be successfully carried out. I intend to make this appointment shortly after the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that the regional chief executive can be required to attend before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for the expenditure of the authority and the three area health boards.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill establishes the three area health boards and defines their functions. Section 14 establishes the boards and provides that they will be known respectively as the Northern, the South-Western and the East Coast Area Health Boards. Each area health board will be a body corporate with the power to sue and be sued and to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property. The population of the northern area, according to 1996 census figures, is 454,088; that of the south-westen area is 515,568 and the population of the east coast area stands at 324,308.</P>
    <P>The functional areas of the three boards will be as set out in the First Schedule to the Bill. The boundaries follow the recommendations of the task force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which spent considerable time examining what might be the optimum division of the region and consulting with the various interests involved. The detailed rationale for the boundaries can be found in the task force's interim report. They follow the local authority boundaries as far as possible. Where the boundaries diverge from the local authority boundaries, they do so for sound service delivery reasons and follow instead local electoral area boundaries.</P>
    <P>Section 15 sets out the functions of the area health boards. They are required to perform the functions delegated to them by the authority; to provide services within their functional areas in accordance with the arrangements made with the authority under section 10 and to plan and co-ordinate the provision of all services in their areas, in co-operation with voluntary service providers.</P>
    <P>This last function, the planning and co-ordination of services at area level, is perhaps the most vital of all the functions of the area health board. The need for substantial improvements in planning, co-ordination and integration of services in the eastern region is widely recognised and was one of the key factors in bringing forward the proposals for new structures in the Bill. The role of the voluntary sector will be crucial.</P>
    <P>Each area chief executive, once appointed, will set about putting in place mechanisms, which will be inclusive of voluntary sector providers, for ensuring good planning and co-ordination of services in their areas. One option for such mechan<Col N="562" /> isms would be the concept of the providers forum, as outlined in the task force report, but other routes could be followed. The legislation is not prescriptive on this point, so as to allow each area to develop its own dynamic and build up the relationships between providers as it sees fit. Voluntary providers in each area will be fully involved in the discussions on the approach to be adopted in their area. My Department is already in discussions with the major voluntary hospitals on this and other issues and I expect that process of consultation will continue and be extended to include other voluntary providers after this Bill's enactment.</P>
    <P>This section also requires an area health board to carry out its functions subject to the general directions of the authority and to co-operate with the authority and the other area health boards in matters of overall co-ordination of services across the region. Where area health boards make arrangements with third parties for the provision of services, they must put systems in place to evaluate and monitor those services.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for membership of the area health boards. It provides that the membership will be specified by the Minister in regulations, subject to certain parameters as set out in this section. Members of area health boards will be appointed by the authority from within the authority's own membership for terms of office of not more than five years.</P>
    <P>At least one member from each of the categories on the authority &ndash; that is to say, public representatives, health professionals, voluntary sector and ministerial nominees &ndash; will be represented on each area health board. Public representatives will hold the majority on all area health boards and the public representatives appointed to each area health board will be from local electoral areas within that board's functional area. Area health boards may make payments to members for travelling and subsistence expenses and may pay allowances to their chairmen and vice-chairmen.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the appointment by the authority, pursuant to a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commissioners, of three area chief executives and their assignment by the authority to the three area health boards. The Minister may appoint the first incumbents prior to establishment day, pursuant to a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commissioners. I hope these three posts could be filled very shortly after the enactment of this Bill, so that the new area chief executives can begin the preparatory work in their areas in advance of the establishment day.</P>
    <P>Area chief executives will hold office on terms and conditions similar to chief executive officers of health boards and shall act as chief executive officers of their area health boards. They will be delegated certain executive powers by the regional chief executive to enable them to manage the services provided within their respective areas and they will be required to exercise their <Col N="563" /> functions subject to the general direction of the regional chief executive.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for keeping accounts by the three area health boards. The accounts of the authority itself will be governed by existing legislation on health boards. This section is an important expression of the stringent accountability which will characterise the work of the new authority.</P>

      <P>Under this section, each area health board is required to prepare annual financial statements in accordance with accounting standards specified by the Minister. These will form part of the consolidated financial statements of the authority and, as such, shall be adopted by the authority. In addition, the accounts of each area health board will form part of the consolidated accounts of the authority and will be audited in the usual way by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Part IV provides for the dissolution of the Eastern Health Board and the transfer of its staff and its assets to the new authority.</P>
      <P>Section 19 provides for the dissolution of the Eastern Health Board on the establishment day and the transfer of its land, property, assets and liabilities to the authority. The authority may, in turn, transfer any land, property, assets or liabilities transferred to it under this section to an area health board. This section also provides for the drawing up of the final accounts of the Eastern Health Board and for the continuation of any legal proceedings, resolutions, orders, notices, rules or regulations made by or involving the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Section 20 provides that the staff of the Eastern Health Board will be transferred to the authority. Except where otherwise negotiated with a recognised trade union, staff transferred to the authority will be subject to terms and conditions not less favourable than those they currently enjoy. Employment contracts held with the Eastern Health Board will transfer to the authority. Staff transferred to the authority may be assigned by the regional chief executive to an area health board and, if so assigned, will be subject to the direction of the relevant area chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff interests will be fully consulted on all the implications of the transfer process. The task force, which has a mandate to manage and oversee the transition to the new structures has made it clear that it will continue the consultation process which has been ongoing with staff interests since it began its task last year. It is also the task force's intention, on the enactment of this Bill, to launch an information campaign which will deal with the concerns of all Eastern Health Board staff regarding the implications of the changes for them and for their work. It is <Col N="564" /> important to bear in mind that only a minority of the 9,000 staff employed by the Eastern Health Board will be affected in any substantial way by the proposed changes. The majority of the staff will continue to work at their present posts, but for a different employing authority.</P>
    <P>Of necessity, the level of consultation with staff interests to date has been fairly low key, as the Oireachtas has yet to give its approval to the proposals in this Bill. However, I expect that, once the Bill has been enacted, the consultation process will intensify significantly. Part V, section 21, establishes a health boards executive. This will be an executive agency serving all of the health boards. It is important to bear in mind that its establishment is an entirely separate matter from the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised for some time now that there is a need for some sort of central agency for the health boards, through which the chief executive officers could jointly pursue some of their common objectives, such as those in the area of health promotion, for example. This provision for a health boards executive will meet that need.</P>
    <P>The executive will have the potential to effect substantial progress on a range of important operational issues which span all health boards. It will provide considerable scope for maximising efficiency and effectiveness across a range of health board functions, both administrative and operational. It may also provide some scope for the devolution of functions from my Department, in keeping with the strategic objectives outlined in the Department's strategy statement, &ldquo;Working for Health and Well-being&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The members of the health boards executive will be the chief executive officers of the health boards including the regional chief executive and the three area chief executives. It will be a corporate body, with the power to sue and be sued, to own land and other property and to employ staff. It will be financed by the health boards and will make an annual report of its activities to the Minister and to each health board.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains amendments to other Acts which, in the main, result from the provisions of the Bill. I draw the attention of Deputies to section 22, which amends the Second Schedule of the Health Act, 1970, in relation to rules of attendance at meetings of health boards. This provision has been included in response to representations made to me by the Association of Health Boards in Ireland. It removes a disparity between local authority members and other members of the boards in relation to rules of attendance at meetings and modifies the rule regarding the disqualification from membership of health boards if more than six consecutive meetings are missed.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill amount to the most significant reform of health service structures in this country since the establishment of the health boards under the Health Act, 1970. Their fundamental aim is to improve substantially the planning, management and delivery of health services <Col N="565" /> to the people of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. They will also ensure that the services are provided in the most effective, efficient and accountable way possible, consistent with the aims of the national health strategy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very important initiative in a series of initiatives which my Department has undertaken in recent years to substantially improve the governance, organisation and management of the health services. It is vital that such measures be taken now, at a time when the economic climate is favourable, so that the services are better equipped to deal with the challenges which will face them in the future.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that the period of transition to the new structures will present a major challenge to the task force, the Eastern Health Board, the voluntary providers and my Department. It will be very important to ensure that the new authority and the other agencies affected by the changes have the personnel, the skills and the infrastructure required to perform the functions expected of them in the new environment. I know the implementation of the proposals in this Bill will take time, patience and perseverance on all sides. However, I am confident everyone will put their shoulders to the wheel in the months ahead so that we can ensure that the health services in the Eastern region can achieve their full potential as we enter the 21st century. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill. I support the concept of putting in place a more efficient health system as it applies to the Eastern Health Board region. The approach proposed by the new Eastern Regional Health Authority may provide a mirror image of changes which may ultimately be applied to other health boards.</P>
      <P>The need for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area authorities is accepted. The huge increase in population in the Eastern Health Board area means individual communities are remote from the health services on which they are dependent. There is a feeling of lack of local accountability for the provision of services and a need to put in place a more responsive system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of technical matters relating to the legislation and policy issues and relevant issues concerning the manner in which the health service operates. The Bill will incorporate voluntary hospitals in a health board structure. They will have autonomy in regard to the provision of services. The matter of annual financial allocations will involve direct discussions with the Department. The voluntary hospitals see themselves as having an independence of the health boards and a degree of flexibility in the provision of services that is not always perceived to be the case in the context of health board managed hospitals. In the various hospitals I have visited, not only in the eastern region but elsewhere, there is a perception that the voluntary hospitals are willing to be more critical of aspects of the <Col N="566" /> health service and of the constraints imposed on their provision of services than health board administered hospitals. I do not say that as a particular criticism of anybody involved in either the medical or the administrative side of the health board hospitals. We are fortunate to have a number of people doing extraordinarily good work in the management of a variety of hospitals, both health board and voluntary.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure the voluntary nature of these hospitals is preserved. There is a degree of concern on the part of some that the new structures may result in a culture developing in which a health authority involved in the direct administration of particular hospitals will tend to have a greater commitment to the provision of funding for the hospitals specifically run by the health board rather than voluntary hospitals. Perhaps the Minister will respond on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is important in the context of the manner in which the regional authority will work that the Minister clarifies how his Department will approach the annual funding provisions at budget time. Will a large sum of money be provided to the regional authority without the Department expressing a view as to where priority should lie? What will be the interaction between the Department and the regional authority on policy issues and who will have the ultimate authority? Will the Minister retain some authority or will the regional authority lay down policy? Will the Minister be accountable to this House? At present, if there is a view concerning a shortfall or a failure to provide a particular service or funding in a health board region, mechanisms such as Dáil questions, Adjournment debates or otherwise can be used to call the Minister to account for his perceived failures. What is the position in this case? Will the Eastern Regional Health Authority, as in the case of other quangos set up in the past, be granted such a degree of autonomy that when difficult questions arise about the capacity or efficiency of the health service in its area, the Minister will disclaim any responsibility or political accountability to the Dáil? That issue is perceived to be more important on this side of the House than on the Government's side. It is about parliamentary accountability for the provision of our health services. It would produce an odd result if future Ministers were accountable to this House for certain aspects of health services, administered by other health boards, but not for areas where they contribute to the decision-making process in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify how the new structure will impact on the teaching functions of the hospitals which come within the relevant region? Will the Department of Health and Children provide funding for teaching hospitals, in the context of their teaching function, separate from the funding allocated by the Eastern Regional Health Authority directly to the area boards which then determine funding for individual hospitals? This is an important issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> A number of the hospitals which will operate under the new arrangement have national specialties. The national specialties are confined to the eastern region. Where will the funding determination originate for voluntary hospitals? There will be particular allocations, as detailed recently by the Minister in the 1999 allocation, for national specialties to different hospitals, whether the Mater Hospital, Tallaght, Beaumont or the Children's Hospital, each of which has a particular specialty of a national dimension. Will the decision concerning funding for those hospitals remain with the Department of Health and Children or will it be determined by the Eastern Regional Health Authority? If so, what criteria will that authority or individual area health boards take into account in determining allocations for the servicing of national specialties?</P>
    <P>What will be the decision-making capacity of the eastern regional health board in determining where national specialties or tertiary services are provided? One can look at the example of a recent controversy, which I do not wish to revisit today. Recommendations were issued by the national cancer forum regarding certain paediatric services for the detection of leukaemia and with regard to whether the main centre should be Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, or Tallaght Hospital for initial diagnosis and treatment plans. Will it be a function of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to make those decisions? Will it be a function of the Minister or the national cancer forum? Who will exercise those judgments and who will be the person or body vested with primary responsibility? The position is not clear from the legislation.</P>
    <P>I support in principle the establishment of new structural mechanisms to ensure greater local accountability for the provision of health services. However, I am concerned about the bureaucratic implications of this proposal, on which the Minister has not enlightened the House. In the context of the current staff in the Eastern Health Board, how does he envisage the devolution of staff as between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three area health boards to be put in place? Will additional staff be required or will current staff be devolved among the different bodies? What mechanisms are to be put in place to do that by agreement and in discussion with the staff unions? Does the Minister anticipate that additional administrative staff will have to be recruited? Will the administrative costs of running the system be expanded by the establishment of a regional health authority and three area boards?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister apply the Department's Tallaght philosophy? It was the Department's view that when three hospitals moved to Tallaght, it was possible to calculate the required funding by totting up the total expenditure of all three hospitals. Is it the Minister's view that the only public expenditure required to provide these new layers of bureaucracy is simply the Eastern <Col N="568" /> Health Board allocation divided into four? The answer is not clear in the legislation.</P>
    <P>If it is more costly, as I suspect it will prove to be, in Civil Service or bureaucratic terms to have one regional authority and three area boards, I am anxious to ensure that the additional costs incurred to establish them do not act to the detriment of the provision of health services and the delivery of health care. If this Government is still in office next year or in 2001 and a judgment is to be made as to what funding should be allocated to this new body, if the base is perceived as the funding allocated to the Eastern Health Board and if the new administrations prove more costly, will there be a run down of health services, particularly services suffering a financial shortfall, with patient waiting lists lengthening as a consequence because the Minister is not prepared to foot the additional bill?</P>
    <P>New structures will not only require a change in the role of the Civil Service, which effectively runs the Eastern Health Board, but will also require new properties and headquarters. The Minister should indicate what research has been done into that aspect of the proposal and what the likely cost will be. Where does he envisage the main centres of each area health board being established? Are buildings currently under construction to establish them and what are the costs of those buildings?</P>
    <P>The legislation does not address one issue. It deals with the composition of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area health boards. However, it does not address the rights of the consumers of health services, be they medical services, child care services, adoption services, social work services and the range of services delivered by the Eastern Health Board at present. These will be delivered by area health boards under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The area boards will have medical and political representatives as detailed in the legislation. However, there is no place for the consumer of health services outside those groups. There should be a place for consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will the public representatives represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a place for consumers outside the representation provided by public representatives. The legislation should provide for a patients consultative committee which would be appointed to report on and be free to criticise aspects of health care delivery by the area boards. It would be something outside the political mainstream and separate from those who are delivering the services to ensure there is a patient focus in hospital and medical services and a consumer focus in the other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a precedent for this. In the Child Care Act, 1991 there is provision for children's committees which are to report to individual health boards on the manner in which children's services are working under that Act. The role of such <Col N="569" /> committees is recognised. There would be a greater role for patients consultative committees. On occasions, the manner in which public representatives might approach health care issues could be determined more by their party view than by particular concerns of patients and, if their party is in Government, it might be dominated by a wish not to embarrass the Minister of the day. A greater role can be played by consumers of the health service than is recognised or provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the composition of the regional authority and the area boards. For once, I might be in agreement with the Minister about an issue. There is a genuine concern about the numbers involved in the authority. I have reservations about the ability of an authority composed of the proposed numbers to deliberate on issues in a workable way. I make that comment as a casualty of Dublin County Council. It functioned extremely well as a council. There were decisions, of which I was then and still am critical, in the rezoning area and issues of other controversy during my membership of the council. However, from 1979 to 1985 the council had 35 members and did its business efficiently.</P>
    <P>Issues were debated, with and without contention, but it got through its agendas and made decisions. That council expanded in 1985 to become a 78 person council and thereafter descended into chaos. It did not work as a 78 person council and that is the reason we now have three different local authorities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I share the concern implicit in the Minister's contribution about the numbers on this authority and I am not sure there is a solution to it. I accept his point that it is important that there is a majority of public representatives on the authority so that there is a degree of political accountability in its workings. We need to give this matter further consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the under-representation of one specific group &ndash; nurses. There is a ratio of one general nurse out of 36 members on the current Eastern Health Board, and this would be altered to one general nurse on an enlarged authority of 55 members. That would effectively result in there not being a general nurse on two of the area health boards. That is a problem.</P>
    <P>We have been slow to recognise &ndash; this is a theme I have spoken about in the past &ndash; that nurses, above all people, are in the front line of the provision of care to patients on a daily basis. They see the good and the bad in the way the health service delivers and they are the direct recipients of what I would describe as the important patient information. If patients believe something is wrong or if they have a problem, they are more likely to articulate that to the nursing staff whom they get to know well in a hospital than to the consultants or other doctors who are important to their medical care and treatment but with whom they have less contact. It is important that there is at least one general nurse representa<Col N="570" /> tive on each of the area health boards and we must devise a mechanism to provide for that. That may require increasing the numbers on the regional authority, and I have already said I am concerned about the numbers on that authority, but we need to value to a far greater degree than we have done over the years, the input the nursing profession can make both in the development and the running of our health services. That difficulty must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how our social work services will be divided up in the context of this new authority? In so far as they are operated through community care or health centres I presume the manner in which the change will work will be relatively straightforward based on where the social worker is employed, but what about our adoption services? There is substantial valid public criticism of the manner in which the adoption service is dealt with in the Eastern Health Board area and the approach taken to many of those who seek to adopt. This problem is not replicated by any of the feedback I have received over the years in respect of the services provided through any other health board. There is a particular problem in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The first issue is in the context of adoption services. What is to happen to them? This is an important issue and it cannot be left on the basis that the regional health authority will decide this at a later stage, which is the simple reply. Is it the view of the Minister that one of the area health boards will effectively provide the eastern regional authority area a service as if it is the speciality of a particular board? If not, is it to be divided between the different area boards? If so, how will that be done administratively? </P>
    <P>Another issue is the need to address the public concerns expressed by a number of people about attitudes displayed by some &ndash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;some&rdquo; because we have some excellent people working in the adoption area in all the health boards &ndash; of the social workers charged with assessing people for foreign adoption and, on occasion, for domestic adoption. Questions are being asked of people seeking to adopt of a nature so intimate as to be irrelevant to determining their suitability as parents. They are a gross invasion of privacy. An ideological approach is being taken by some social workers to people seeking to adopt which suggests that if a couple is seeking to adopt from abroad, there is something dysfunctional about that married couple that the social worker has to come to terms with and analyse. There have been reports that some social workers believe that before a couple's suitability for adoption abroad can be determined, they have to be focused to engage in some type of bereavement counselling for the fact that they have been unable to conceive. That ideology has afflicted social work in Great Britain and is found among small groups of people in Ireland and it is a genuine cause of public concern.</P>
    <P>This problem has not been treated seriously enough by Government. I am aware a depart<Col N="571" /> mental committee is examining the procedures applied in the Eastern Health Board area but we should not dismiss public concerns an increasingly vocal number of people are expressing about the manner in which they are treated.</P>
    <P>There is a great inefficiency about the way the system works. For example, I am aware that people who sought to apply to adopt abroad were put on a long adoption waiting list in the Eastern Health Board area. A year or 18 months later they received a letter to the effect that they have reached the top of the list whereby an assessment might commence, but before it could commence a whole range of documentation was sought from them which could have been sought at the outset when they were put on the waiting list. The assessment that had been awaited for 12 or 18 months was then put back when the people were informed for the first time of a range of documents required from them that may take them another two or three months to accumulate. That is not the way to treat people. That issue should be addressed and the Minister should clarify the manner in which our adoption services are administered under the new system.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister that the new health authority and the area boards will have up to date and efficient information systems which will ensure that there is updated information on the state of waiting lists, the availability of consultants, the length of time people have to wait to see consultants working in particular specialities, to get in-patient hospital care or attend a hospital for day surgery. I want an assurance from the Minister that those information systems will be linked into the Department of Health and Children. The Department is antediluvian in the manner in which it accumulates information. It is a national scandal that in February 1999 we only know the waiting list figures up to September 1998. The Department's information systems are six months behind. That is part of the difficulty with the health service &ndash; the Department does not have up to date information and is not in a position to make immediate decisions to intervene in areas where difficulties have arisen.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if the new area boards or the health authority will have funding flexibility, if it is found that there is an unexpected escalation in waiting lists, so there can be targeted additional financial allocations to ensure that patients in need of care receive it without undue delay?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend a broad welcome to this Bill in so far as it deals with the reorganisation of the Eastern Health Board. Despite its title, this Bill is not just about that reorganisation, although that issue is addressed in its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If passed unamended, the Bill has the potential to shift the balance within the entire health board <Col N="572" /> system in a way which would be at variance with the principles of democratic accountability and transparency. We are going ahead with the establishment of a health board authority for the greater Eastern Health Board region. There is, however, also a new executive proposed which will be unelected, unaccountable and separate from the Eastern Health Board reorganisation. That is a significant matter.</P>
    <P>There was no warning about this proposal. It indicates that we are not discussing genuine devolution of power. These new boards may turn out to be puppet regimes rather than centres of governance. There is a history of tight, centralised control of health care in Ireland and a lack of confidence in the ability of health boards. We all recognise that there are structural problems in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>These problems have been considered by a number of Governments. Ten years ago the Commission on Health Funding identified the need for integration of responsibility for all levels of service within catchment areas. The Eastern Health Board region was identified as lacking such integration. The Kennedy report in 1990 argued for better co-ordination and integration of services. The health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, proposed a new authority in 1994 to co-ordinate the various strands of statutory and voluntary service providers. Since then the Task Force on the Eastern Regional Authority carried out its work, into which the previous Minister had an input, and now the Minister is introducing this Bill to the House. We are debating the results of a considerable amount of work and deliberation by many people. I acknowledge their efforts.</P>
    <P>The project is defined as the establishment of a new eastern regional health authority which will be responsible for the funding of all health and personal social services, both statutory and voluntary, in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. Its purpose is to reform organisational structures to improve co-ordination and integration in the planning and delivery of services. As such it will impact directly on hundreds of thousands of people in the greater Dublin conurbation.</P>
    <P>Apart from reorganising the Eastern Health Board this Bill contains provisions with fundamental implications for all health boards, provisions tagged on to the Bill which have nothing to do with the restructuring. It is not unusual that items are added to Bills, usually as a tidying up exercise, but in this case I have a suspicion it is more than that &ndash; it is a stitching up exercise.</P>
    <P>The proposed establishment of the health board executive is a new, distinct measure which is at variance with the spirit of the Bill. Such a proposal would not have been subject to the extensive discussion, consultation and analysis as the other proposals. This will be an executive made up of all the health board chief executive officers, including those in the restructured East<Col N="573" /> ern Health Board region, which will have wide ranging powers but will not be answerable to the local health board or the health authority of the greater Dublin area, but solely to itself and the Minister for Health and Children. The Minister is proposing to establish a super authority made up of the most senior executive health officers which will meet in secret and make decisions on behalf of health boards. These things happen, we have all been local authority members and know the way in which power is disseminated in this State. It is not always democratic. There are habits learned over the years which must be addressed. The health boards do not have to be informed what the executive meetings decide. The only person they will be answerable to is the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Section 21(4) specifies that this executive shall perform, on behalf of the health boards, such executive functions as may be specified from time to time by the members of the executive and such other executive functions in relation to improving the efficiency of the health and social services as the Minister may, from time to time, direct. This is an executive of unelected officials working on behalf of the health boards but not subject or accountable to them. Solely accountable to itself and the Minister, the executive will be resourced by members of the health board, whether they want to or not, who will not even know about the decisions it makes.</P>
    <P>The powers of the executive might not always be used, but if they are used they are extensive. They include buying and selling property, receipt of gifts, taking on staff and commissioning research. It will not, however, be subject to democratic scrutiny. I do not count provision of an annual report as subjecting it to scrutiny. I have seen enough reports to know that they can be beautifully designed to tell nothing. The meetings will be in private and the local accountability will be nil.</P>
    <P>This measure has not been debated in any public forum. There is a danger that it will establish a shadow chain of authority made up of full-time senior figures referring solely to themselves or the Minister. That negates the spirit of this Bill which is to ensure that there is accountability and that democracy is extended.</P>
    <P>On 17 November 1996, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced the publication of this Bill. His press release did not mention the provision of an executive. He commented in his speech:</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill should not come as a surprise to anyone as they have been formulated and developed by my Department taking into account the views expressed by the task force by all the various interests involved.</P>
    <P>When I read section 21 I was surprised, as were the members of health boards with whom I checked at random. Since he did not do so in his <Col N="574" /> speech when publishing the Bill, the Minister should on replying explain in greater detail what is going on. He should explain where the public demand exists for chief executive officers to be organised on a statutory basis for the first time. If the same basis was provided for country managers, it would not be as easy to slip it through.</P>
    <P>We must look at the long-term effects of such a structure being established. Where is the body of opinion which seeks to centralise power and decision making in this way? The executive will only make executive decisions but there are considerable powers in the ability to make those decisions. Are the chief executive officers seeking this or is the Minister making this decision to keep a tight control? I suspect this comes from senior management in health boards. There may be arguments for efficiency and integration which support this.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, they must be accountable and subject to functioning and effective democratic controls. The Minister should uncouple this provision and use it in a different Bill so that we can concentrate on the matter at hand. That is what I would have liked to have done from the start.</P>
    <P>In considering the central theme of the Bill, it is worth asking what precise change will the reorganisation of the Eastern Health Board mean to the public. The primary aim, according to the task force's report, is the delivery of a high quality, effective, integrated and efficient patient-centred health and social service for the people of the region. That is a lofty objective, and it would be nice to think it could be achieved. Realistically, however, it will not be, unless there is a radical change in the quality and inequality inherent in our acute hospital service in particular. Fundamental questions on how our health services are structured have to be addressed if we are to reach that fine objective.</P>
    <P>Almost 40,000 people are on waiting lists for hospital procedures, and many more are waiting to attend consultants. People are now waiting to wait to attend consultants. How will the elderly woman waiting months for a hip replacement operation or the young man waiting years for a heart bypass benefit from this reorganisation? I was interested to hear the Minister use the rather touching example of an elderly person in hospital. Elderly people waiting for beds in hospitals are often at risk in their own homes because of insufficient supports. I know an elderly gentleman who spent a night on the floor of his home last week because there was nobody to assist him. He needs a hip replacement operation, but will not get one for months, and continues to live at risk in his home. These are individual cases and it is unusual for the Minister to take a specific example of an elderly woman going through the system.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what difference the reorganisation of the health board will mean to that woman's life. As the Minister introduced this matter, I would like to hear how he sees that woman's <Col N="575" /> life being altered in terms of quality of care and equality of access to such care. Will the establishment of four health boards instead of one shorten a waiting list or free up a bed? Will it bridge the deep seated inequality in our acute hospitals between the patients who can afford to pay and those who cannot? There is no evidence it will.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in the Bill will bring the delivery of services closer to people and streamline and integrate services. I hope this objective is met. It is worth mentioning, however, that at no point does the Bill refer to the public and patients, those who receive these services. It would be refreshing to see some mention of them. I know the way Bills are produced and that this is not in the nature of that process, but we need to focus on those who are at the centre of these changes. That does not mean the staff of the health boards, the bureaucracy or the doctors, it means the person who is likely to be sick or the elderly person, which we all hope to be some day.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed structure the authority will have powers to plan and oversee as well as fund statutory and voluntary services. These are to be integrated under one overall authority, which is a worthwhile objective, but I am curious as to why one service provider is not included under the aegis of that authority. I refer to the private hospitals which comprise a growing element in this area, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region. The growing number of nursing homes are now subject to Eastern Health Board regulations, a very beneficial change. However, this authority was presumably designed to integrate all the services and private hospitals are flourishing and providing a service to at least part of the population of the region. They are doing so thanks to the taxpayer in so far as individuals get tax relief for taking out private health insurance. These hospitals are a growing force and their presence distorts the health services in ways we must be aware of when planning and monitoring services. It would be better if a connection were made, although I do not want these private hospitals doing better out of this. However, it is shortsighted to ignore the impact they are having on health services. This may also skew the planning and perspective of any such authority.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I am concerned about the provisions for funding of voluntary hospitals. Up to now this was a straightforward process in that they were funded by the Department. Under the new arrangements they will be funded by the authority, and certain interest groups have expressed concerns about this. Some have been very blunt in their complaints, stating that they feel there is a multilayer of bureaucracy that will stymie them. There have been strong criticisms from the Adelaide Hospital Society that describe an understandable fear that these layers may be created to block the clear line it now has to the Department. I do not have a problem with the principle of transferring that power, <Col N="576" /> but there are difficulties here that may not have been adequately considered.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in the definition in section 7 of the authority's responsibility in its functional area. It is feared this will be too restrictive. Regarding Tallaght Hospital, legal concerns have been expressed about the status of services carried out in hospitals that are beyond the limits of the functional area referred to in section 7. A hospital like Tallaght has a national role and a particular ethos. Other hospitals have particular specialties that give them a dimension outside the functional area of the Eastern Health Board region. Some have roles as teaching hospitals linked to universities, which gives them a national role and profile.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question I asked about national specialist centres in cardiology or neurology, I received a response which stated the Department would tag funds for these specific activities when funds were allocated to the authority. It is not clear from the Bill how that will be done on a statutory basis. It could also mean the authority would become a rubber stamp for what the Department wants or, as was suggested earlier, it could be largely a mudguard to protect the Minister.</P>
    <P>Funding is another concern. Implementation of this proposal will not be cheap and I want to know how much it will cost. Many people are concerned that administration in the health services is eating up too much money. It is easy to find a scapegoat, but there are dangers inherent in this of which I am sure the Minister is aware. As I said earlier, there is also the problem of conflict between the policies of the Department and the authority when strategic decisions are being made. Paediatric services was the example given; one gets the impression that Crumlin Hospital will end up with every paediatric service in the greater Dublin area. I do not know if that is the intention, but Temple Street Children's Hospital and Tallaght Hospital are concerned in this regard. It is vital that paediatric services continue at Temple Street. The community is very dependent on that busy hospital.</P>
    <P>Strategic decisions made at authority level may conflict with those of the Department, and although the Minister may not have all the answers yet &ndash; we may only know when the authority is set up &ndash; I would like that clarified. To quote the Adelaide Hospital Society on Tallaght Hospital:</P>
    <P>To lose its funding for the provision of services, save in the functional area of the authority, will impact on [Tallaght Hospital's] ability to fulfil its functions under the charter. The provisions of section 8(4), although stating that nothing in the Bill should prejudice the performance by the new hospital in Tallaght of its functions under its charter, do not achieve that protection, because they do away with the funding arrangements necessary to ensure the hospital functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> One cannot do something unless one has the money to do it. There is a certain irony in mentioning Tallaght Hospital since it is in the throes of a crisis which arises directly from the failure of the Department of Health and Children to provide sufficient funding.</P>

      <P>There is anxiety that this will create further difficulties at a time when stability and a sound foundation is required.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister about public representatives. The principles lay down that they shall form a majority on all the boards &ndash; that is fine, it is democratic accountability &ndash; but the method whereby the public will be represented by those individuals is so labyrinthine is hard to see how the public will be able to make the connection. The representative will be elected to a local authority, which has nothing to do with the health board, that person will subsequently be selected for the regional authority, which in turn will direct her or him back to the area board, which is similar to what happens at present. I regret bitterly that the Minister did not take the opportunity to develop an initiative for our health boards, which is so badly needed. He could maintain the democratic accountability by having a majority of public representatives on the board but he should consider changing how we elect these people.</P>
      <P>The best way forward is direct election &ndash; let the people decide who they want on their area health board, because it would bring into the system people who have no interest in standing for local authorities. We need new blood, even considering the average age of local authority members, although the scrappage scheme is dealing with that. We need to bring into local government people who have a sense of civic duty but are alienated from the current structure. Many people working in health care on a voluntary basis could stand for election if they felt they were seeking election to an area health board in order to contribute to and represent people in their area.</P>
      <P>I will put forward amendments and, although the Minister may have to consult the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I cannot imagine this creates much difficulty. Such long distance democracy as is proposed in this Bill means nothing to a public which is already fed up with bureaucracy. It has neither connection to them nor meaning for them, and we need to deal with that, not disregard it and follow what the last Minister did because we do not want to get in trouble with councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what can go wrong on health boards and local authorities. We know there can be a gravy train &ndash; we have all seen it. If we are to ensure the presence on health boards of people who are dedicated to the task of representing the public, I suggest a clear, direct mechanism &ndash; let <Col N="578" /> people vote for the person who ends up on the board, and let no one get in between.</P>
    <P>The question of representation is problematic &ndash; if everyone is represented on a board one will never find a room big enough for all of them. However, under Partnership 2000, some 9,000 staff members are entitled to representation in some form.</P>

      <P>It is important to look at the structure. On one side, critics say it is just a bureaucratic cat's cradle which will soak up money and not improve the health services. Others, like myself, believe in devolution of power and think this kind of change, if done properly, can create a dynamic and make things work in a way they have not up to now. However, we should not overstate what is possible or disregard the difficulties and flaws in our health boards. Many matters will not be touched by these structural changes, whether they are to do with good management, training &ndash; not just of staff but of board members if necessary &ndash; accountability, and trust. Mr. Seán Conroy has written an interesting article, and he should know about these issues because he is a health board official:</P>
      <P>All boards at various times recognise they are experiencing problems and most make efforts at corrective action. This action is usually no more than symptom control. Boards get more involved in organisation, multiple committees, endless meetings, agendas packed with operational matters, or [get less involved]: &ldquo;Let the chief executive do the job&rdquo;; &ldquo;Tell us what you want approved&rdquo;. Boards or board chairman elbow the chief executive officer out of the way and assume day to day management, or else retreat into embarrassed impotence: &ldquo;We're only volunteers&rdquo;. Boards decide their role is communicating staff and boosting morale, or else seclude themselves in the minutiae of long-range planning. Boards become inquisitors of their chief executive officers, or high profile fan clubs for their chief executive officers. The same board at different junctures can adopt any of the above stances, usually as a reaction to a perceived problem of the moment, and it is difficult to lead reactively. We cannot afford to continue to sentence well-meaning people to penal servitude on dysfunctional boards, or to sentence organisations to governance without leadership. We can liberate boards to create the energy and vision we know to be probable when groups of individuals act with synergy. Society has long known of the moral power of such activity; we have a jury system in our courts to prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we get this right. I hope the Minister will have an open mind on amendments because the Bill is not complete yet. There are dangers &ndash; the health services are sick, particularly the structures in the eastern region &ndash; but when we administer medicine we should make sure we make the patient better rather than worse. My original point about the executive has not been addressed politically there has not been any discussion: I may be wrong, but my anecdotal experience is that no health board is aware there will be an executive made up of chief executive <Col N="580" /> officers, reporting directly to the Minister. I wonder whether, politically, that is a wise, good, and democratic thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I am not a member of a health board, but, like most Deputies and councillors, I have a good deal of interaction with various aspects of the Eastern Health Board's activities. It is responsible for a vast range of health and social services. The range of services outlined in its most recent annual report is staggering. I compliment its staff and executives on their work. Their task is almost beyond the capacity of the board to deliver.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for a population that is six times greater than the population of approximately 205,000 covered by the Midland Health Board. There are two community care areas in my constituency and either of them would cover a greater population than many of the other health boards. That in itself is a reason for introducing reform at this stage. While only three hospitals in its area report directly to the Eastern Health Board, it is a matter of concern that the other hospitals in that area do not. Under this Bill the new authority will take over responsibility for funding all services in the region to facilitate integrated planning of services and better integration and co-ordination of service delivery.</P>
      <P>This Bill is evidence of the Government's continued commitment to the health sector. There are problems, but an 11 per cent increase in the day-to-day funding of that sector in 1999 was secured by the Minister, Deputy Cowen. A special package totalling £45 million was set aside in the budget to cover services for the mentally handicapped, older people and hospital waiting lists. I cannot let this occasion pass without thanking the Minister who today informed me that he has made a capital grant of £680,000 available for the provision of a long awaited day care centre in the Finglas area. I compliment the local committee who have campaigned for this centre over many years. This is the first time a Minister for Health has given tangible commitment to a project that will cater for the older population in the Finglas area. It should be up and running by this time next year. It will compliment the go ahead given by the Minister for the staffing of St. Clare's Nursing Home in my constituency, which will bring it up to the highest standard. My constituency has a significantly higher older population than many other constituencies.</P>
      <P>A total of £8 million, which is additional to the £12 million already allocated, has been set aside for the waiting list initiative. I know the Minister is committed to meeting the needs of the mental health sector. He has secured £12 million, which is additional to the £6 million that has been provided for this sector. An additional £2 million will be allocated to accident and emergency services. Those increases in allocations are illustrative of the extent of the Government's commitment to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I wish to focus on the deficiencies in the Eastern Health Board's delivery of services. The ability of the health board to deliver services to those affected by substance abuse, particularly drug abuse, has not been well handled for a reason that has not been well explained. That view is shared by many of my Dublin colleagues. The Eastern Health Board seems to have an amazing capacity to antagonise local communities when it attempts to establish treatment centres in communities and it displays an inability to bring people along with it. However, it has done some work extremely well and I compliment it on that. Domville House in Ballymun is a case in point where there has been extensive and ongoing consultation with the local community. The facility has been so successful that with the help of the local community and the local drugs task force it is possible to extend the service provided there, but that is the exception to the rule. At the other end of my constituency where there are up to 600 identified heroin abusers, all that can be provided are 50 places in a methadone maintenance facility and ten places in a satellite of that centre. That provision reflects badly on us all and on the health board's inability to explain the seriousness of this problem. It also raises questions about the commitment of communities to grasp the nettle in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I sit on a monitoring committee of one of the drug treatment centres on which the gard, the health services, Dublin Corporation and the local community are represented. Where there is trust it works, but that is not always the case. We have been looking for a site in Finglas to set up a major treatment centre, but we have not had any success. The health board has not taken up the opportunities provided quickly enough. There are lessons to be learned by the new authority about the delivery of services. Given there will be community representation on area health boards, it is possible and practical to expect a speedier and more responsive delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>We need to expedite the provision of services for older people. There are not enough day care centres or nursing home places, but I compliment the health board on developing community care services. It has become extremely good at providing community care teams who are available almost seven days a week and 24 hours a day to assist families and patients in their homes.</P>
    <P>The medical card application process is of major concern to many people. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on introducing in the budget a vastly improved scheme of eligibility for those over 70. If the response of many of the constituents visiting my clinic is anything to go by, it appears this improved scheme is greatly appreciated. A great deal of bureaucracy surrounds the medical card application process. One usually applies to the community care headquarters and sometimes the application is sent to the local health centre requesting additional information. The form is returned to the community care headquarters and sent to Dr. Steeven's Hospital <Col N="582" /> and it is then passed back down the line again. The process is incredibly convoluted.</P>
    <P>There is also a delay in processing the application if the form is not fully completed or additional information is required. From my experience of dealing with such applications, more often than not the application is lost somewhere along the line, but that is not surprising given the chain of command through which it is dealt. The process needs to be streamlined. I would like a medical card appeals system introduced along the lines of the social welfare appeals system. The Minister has spoken about this. As long as there is a devolved system for dealing with medical card applications, it will be difficult to introduce a centralised appeals system, but the introduction of an appeals system needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Eastern Health Board on its community development work. I have been closely associated with two excellent projects, one in St. Helena's in Finglas. It provides great support to families with young children, speech therapy and a range of other services. Geraldstown House in Ballymun is another example of a good project. That project has involved close contact with the local community and close co-operation with the healthy city project in Ballymun. It is one of the jewels in the crown of the services provided by the health board and I compliment it on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from discussions I had with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and SIPTU, I arranged that my Department set up and facilitate discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing. I am anxious that Irish involvement be increased and sustained over the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I previously stated in the House, there are <Col N="583" /> no powers available to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services by the oil companies involved in offshore exploration activities. The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU regulations. Responsibility as regards employment of workers, the provision of services and related issues are strictly matters for the exploration companies and their contractors.</P>
    <P>With regard to the selection and use of Irish ports, these are also matters for the companies concerned. My Department's sole responsibility in that regard is to ensure that the port meets the necessary criteria, particularly in respect of the required emergency response standards. Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration operations. In that context, Enterprise Ireland liaises with port authorities regarding the development of local servicing for the oil and gas industry in order to maximise successful bidding.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that it is Government policy to ensure that the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister communicate with the petroleum affairs division in his Department? It is my understanding that Enterprise Oil will be drilling again this year and will require a service base location. The Minister will be aware that this was lost last year. A separate contract will be granted in respect of catering which will offer employment for 20 people. I understand that it would not be difficult to win that contract <Col N="584" /> and retain some of the employment on offer in this country. Additional discussions on a discreet basis might elicit a favourable response.</P>

For example, there have been suggestions that the people involved might not be up to date on safety procedures and refresher courses can be provided to remedy that. I am sympathetic to the Deputy's views on this area and I want to see action taken because what happened last year was unfortunate.</P>
      <P>We expect and hope to see further exploration this year with an additional two wells being drilled to delineate the field. The well drilled last year appears to have been successful and the indications are good. However, further exploration is required. We hope this will happen in the current year which would mean that a great deal of additional employment would be on offer in the area.

      <P>Information regarding the various authorisations issued, together with the names and addresses of the companies involved in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, is contained in a report prepared by my Department every three months or so. A copy of the latest report is being furnished to the Deputy. I should add that the names of companies exploring for petroleum are a matter of public record. I report the position by way of a half yearly report in respect of each six month period ending 30 June or 31 December, in accordance with the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960. These reports are laid before each House of the Oireachtas and copies are kept in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent report available covers the period 1 July 1998 to 31 December 1998.</P>

    <P>There is no company engaged in drilling for hydrocarbons in our continental shelf at present. However, there were important developments last year in relation to two hydrocarbon accumu<Col N="585" /> lations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field. Three other earlier discoveries of some significance were the Connemara oil field, the Seven Heads oil and gas accumulation and the south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Corrib, located off the Mayo coast, in 1998 Enterprise Oil and its partners, Saga Petroleum and Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited, drilled and tested an appraisal well, flaring gas on a test at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage; this will only be possible when the accumulation has been fully evaluated. The evaluation process will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years and is expected to include the drilling of additional appraisal wells.</P>
    <P>In May last year a ten year petroleum lease was granted to Providence Resources plc, over the Helvic oil field off the Waterford coast. Published figures indicate that it contains an estimated seven million barrels of recoverable oil together with associated gas. Under the terms of the petroleum lease, the company is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field for my approval by 1 May 2000.</P>
    <P>The Connemara oil field, with an estimated 200 million barrels of oil in-place, was appraised in 1997 by Statoil but the results were such that the company concluded that it could not declare the field commercial. The Seven Heads oil and gas accumulation, estimated to have at least 50 million barrels of oil and 100 billion cubic feet of gas in-place, was offered to the industry last year under a lease undertaking round but no applications were received by my Department.</P>
    <P>The south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field, estimated to contain some 50 billion cubic feet of gas in-place, is not being drained by the existing production facilities. Marathon, the operator, is currently considering the possibility of a programme of development to bring this into production.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing to promote and encourage, to the fullest extent, hydrocarbon exploration in Irish waters in order to enhance the prospects of further commercial discoveries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. Is it conditional on the issuing of licences that the companies are obliged to supply him with regular reports on their activities? Is he satisfied they provide all the information required by the licence? Is he confident that any of the finds are likely to develop and become commercially active?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are regular reports and <Col N="586" /> people are designated to be on the rigs &ndash; they can be vessels or rigs &ndash; while work is ongoing. My officials, geologists and others involved are confident they have the necessary information. They are experts in the field and have been involved for a long time. They would, therefore, be good operators. I am anxious to ensure I have the best possible knowledge of what is happening.</P>
      <P>With regard to the most recent finds, the Helvick oil field involving Providence Resources plc is, unfortunately, a relatively small find. It is commercial, but it will not have a huge impact. We await further developments there.</P>
      <P>A major find last year was the gas well off the coast of County Mayo. There is much confidence about its future. The flow rate of 63 cubic metres of gas on what is termed a 2 inch choke &ndash; if the choke was bigger the flow rate would be higher &ndash; indicates a high pressure rate. At the time, the flow rate was recorded as the sixth best for either the North Sea or here in terms of an individual well. However, it is located well out in the Atlantic Ocean, it is expensive to reach and a field would be required. The question then arises as to what will happen next. The two other wells would delineate the field and show if the estimates of the rest of the gas in the area, which have been derived from geological studies and soundings, are realised. I am hopeful the results will be positive, but until results from these two wells are established it will not be possible to be clear about the situation.</P>
      <P>It is important that these wells are drilled. That the plans are being proceeded with in the current climate is important because investment in this drilling area has been virtually eliminated in view of the very low price of oil. It is a bad period to be engaging in such activities, but it should not last indefinitely. If the field produces the expected results it will be the biggest find here since the Kinsale gas find.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in communication with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the need to clarify the respective roles of BIM and An Bord Bia with regard to the seafood export marketing function and the future strategic relationship between the two agencies. As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, the optimum benefits in terms of the use of resources can best be achieved by defining clear complementary roles for both organisations. <Col N="587" /> To give an exclusive remit to either body would not offer the best results.</P>
      <P>In general, I believe BIM should retain a specialist marketing focus as the integrated development agency for the seafood sector. There are a number of reasons I have come to this view. They include organisational change in BIM itself over the past two years, my analysis of the specific characteristics and needs of the fisheries sector, trends in the EU and global seafood market and the stated preferences and needs of Irish seafood processors and exporters.</P>
      <P>This does not, however, preclude an ongoing important role for An Bord Bia in terms of incorporating seafood into its generic food promotion and trade activities overseas, especially at the top end of the value added chain and in markets where realistically BIM cannot have a presence. An Bord Bia has been doing a first class job for the overall Irish food export sector since inception and the two agencies can work together very effectively as appropriate and without overlap in delivering on their respective and complementary remits.</P>
      <P>Officials of both Departments have been discussing mechanisms for delivering the strategic relationship and I am anxious that matters can be finalised quickly with a view to establishing an overall agreed strategic approach which will clarify and set the way forward for BIM and An Bord Bia in this area. I am pleased that good progress has been made to maximise existing and new markets for our seafood wordwide even allowing for the present global difficulties in the pelagic market which BIM and the industry are working together to tackle. Exports have increased by more than 60 per cent since 1990 and are now worth more than £250 million per annum. There will continue to be exponential demand in the EU and worldwide for high value seafood as well as for the flesh product. Strategic co-operation between BIM and An Bord Bia, reflecting their respective expertise and responsibilities, will deliver the most cost efficient and effective of State resources and networks in the global market and is in the best interests of the Irish seafood sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>BIM recently attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I compliment Mr. Keogh and Mr. Ridge on the good work they are doing with the board. They made an interesting presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions between the two boards have been ongoing since 1994. These have centred on how they complement each other. While I have no problem with BIM retaining the function of promoting the overseas marketing of Irish seafood processors and exporters, it is important to estab<Col N="588" /> lish the nature of the strategic relationship between the two boards.</P>
    <P>Last July the Minister gave a similar reply to a question on this matter. Will he indicate when the discussions will be finalised? Is there a deadline? BIM and An Bord Bia are represented in different locations throughout the world. The purpose of these discussions is to maximise seafood potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Bia was eventually established in December 1994 after much discussion. It is important that both boards work closely together. Many developments have taken place in BIM, especially in the marketing sector in the past 18 months to two years. Both the chairman, Mr. Pat Ridge, and the chief executive, Mr. Pat Keogh, are giving a great deal of attention to the marketing sector. This new drive is necessary. The Deputy may have seen the recent advertisement for people which they are hoping will strengthen it considerably.</P>
      <P>I had discussions recently with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, about developing and finalising a clear memorandum of understanding. Both I and the Minister agree with the Deputy on this point. If an organisation, such as BIM, is not involved in a marketing drive, we are wasting our time because everything relates to the market. Unless we listen to the consumer and feed back those ideas, we will be second or third best. That is why I am anxious for BIM to have a strong marketing sector which will fit in with the work of An Bord Bia. That is what we are trying to agree. I hope to finalise the memorandum of understanding in the near future and to remove any overlaps where they occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>My overall policy objective is to encourage and support the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. The aquaculture sector is playing a valuable role in the provision of jobs and economic activity in coastal areas. There are more <Col N="589" /> than 3,000 people employed in the sector and aquaculture production is worth £60 million per year. The industry accounts for 30 per cent of the volume of fish production and is an increasingly important supplier of raw material to the processing sector.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Fisheries £11 million is supporting investment in the aquaculture sector. Almost £10 million has already been committed to more than 80 finfish and shellfish farms and BIM and the industry is confident that all the available funding will be taken up by the industry in this programme.</P>
      <P>As previously advised to the House, I have appointed consultants to carry out a strategic analysis of future directions and opportunities for the aquaculture industry. This economic analysis will be completed shortly and will provide additional back-up for the case for investment support for the sector post 2000. As we approach the next round of Structural Funds, I will push strongly for significant EU and national funding to underpin the continued expansion of aquaculture. Sustainable growth in this indigenous natural resource based sector will pay economic dividends in terms of job creation, productivity and exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Aquaculture is a sustainable native industry based in peripheral coastal regions. Perhaps the Minister could clarify his commitment to this industry for the six year period from 2000 to 2006. Will he commit at least £100 million to this valuable industry which is not constrained by quotas or dependent on EU price supports? Aquaculture business is operated in a free market where success or failure depends on making sound investment decisions. Is the Minister prepared to invest £100 million in this industry over a six year period, which is approximately £15 million per year? This industry employs 3,000 people, is worth £60 million and has great potential for expansion, but we are only tapping the surface. I hope the money will be provided for its development.</P>

I am sure the Deputy and Senator O'Donovan will be sharing votes at the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy wants to know if I will give £100 million to this industry over the next six years. I <Col N="590" /> assure him that any part of the industry which seeks funding for the next six years will be considered on the basis of its potential economic activity. As the Deputy said, we are only tapping the surface of its tremendous growth. I will visit all areas and encourage people to become involved in aquaculture.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Finucane and Deputy Sheehan for their assistance in bringing important legislation to fruition before the end of the last session. This has helped considerably. I indicated then that I would try to issue 90 licences before the end of January and I am pleased I was able to do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At its final session in March 1997, the intergovernmental panel on forests, IPF, encouraged countries and international agencies concerned to strengthen ongoing activities aimed at sustainable forest management within the framework of national forest programmes, and to promote the technical and scientific examination, testing and adaptation of internationally, regionally, subregionally and nationally agreed criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management.</P>
      <P>In June 1997, the special session of the general assembly of the United Nations established the intergovernmental forum on forests, IFF, to continue the international forest policy dialogue and in particular identify the possible elements of and work towards a consensus on international arrangements and mechanisms, for example, a legally binding instrument on all types of forests, and report to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a member of the CSD, Commission on Sustainable Development, and has been an active participant in the IPF and IFF. The IFF programme covers three years and my Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs have agreed to contribute to the financial running of the secretariat for the period of the programme. The first session, IFF 1, was held in New York in October 1997 to decide on its schedule and programme of work. The second session, IFF 2, was held in Geneva in August-September 1998 and the third session, IFF 3, at which my Department will be represented will be held in Geneva in May 1999. IFF 3 will in the main address the outstanding issues from IFF 2. These are: category I reporting on progress on the implementation of the IFF recommendations; category II (IIa) the need for financial resources; (IIb) trade and environment; (IIc) transfer of <Col N="592" /> technology; (IId) issues needing further clarification; category III future international arrangements and mechanisms, including a global convention on forests.</P>
    <P>In the context of the IFF the above issues are matters of EU competence and are being addressed by the EU Commission. To date only limited progress has been achieved at IFF 2 and consequently Ireland has nothing to date to implement in the context of IFF. However, in a national context, substantial progress is being made in the introduction of sustainable forestry management for forests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made clear to the House on numerous occasions, I am giving every priority to mounting, through strict enforcement, an effective ban on the illegal activities of flagships and all fishing vessels irrespective of nationality in the Irish zone. Our fisheries protection services at sea and on land are co-operating closely to ensure flagship activities in these waters are rigorously monitored and controlled. There are particular enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships. I have been pressing my UK and Spanish colleagues, who have legal responsibilities in this regard, to fully co-operate with us in intensifying their inspection operations <Col N="594" /> and in ongoing liaison and information exchange. This approach is now paying dividends. The success of this joint approach sends a clear signal that illegal fishing will not be tolerated and that the member states concerned are increasingly prepared to work together to ensure compliance with the rules. I also took the opportunity at my recent meeting with the Spanish Minister for Fisheries to put in place new arrangements for bilateral co-operation on control and enforcement. These measures include regular contacts between both inspection services and visits by Irish inspectors to Spain.</P>
    <P>I will continue to take a strong line on the need for a strong Europe wide, strictly enforced, fisheries control regime, as the viability of the resource and the interests of the Irish fishing fleet depend on compliance by all fishermen with the rules. Ireland has been to the forefront in supporting important new developments in the field of fisheries control such as satellite monitoring and real time catch reporting. The Fisheries Council in December 1998 agreed on measures to improve control and enforcement. These measures, which come into force on 1 July, will help to tighten up on the monitoring and inspection of flagships. These new measures, which I pushed for strongly at Council, will help create the much needed level playing field in fisheries control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the objective of banning flags of convenience be achieved? I understand it would have substantial financial and legal implications. It is estimated that the total catch in the Irish zone is 1 million tonnes with an estimated value of £700 million, of which the Irish fishing fleet accounts for £150 million or 20 per cent. In his recent discussions with the Spanish Fisheries Minister, Mrs. de Palacio, did the Minister discuss the possible banning of flagships? I understand there are 115 UK Spanish registered flagships operating in the Irish zone. On the inspectorate, there is a lack of uniformity. There are more than 20,000 fishing vessels in Vigo. This raises serious questions about monitoring and enforcement. There is a strict regime in place here. The Minister is doing his job in conservation but is the pain being shared? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There were important developments at the meeting with Mrs. de Palacio. For the first time Irish inspectors will visit Spanish ports with the full support of the Spanish authorities to discuss landing checks. This should help to ensure a level playing field and allow us achieve the principal objective. It was a breakthrough when my Spanish counterpart agreed to these arrangements. We will continue to be responsible for monitoring at sea. There will also be satellite monitoring in the blue box. From 1 July there will be a requirement to report the quantities of fish caught in each box. This should ensure greater control. A vessel could be inspected but the fish could have been caught anywhere. There would still be potential for that, <Col N="595" /> but it strengthens our position in watching and controlling the operations of those vessels. A few other detailed measures have been taken to try to establish a level playing pitch. That is just part of the package; we will see useful developments. We have offered the Spanish inspectors the opportunity to work with ours. The Spanish Minister and the authorities want to create a fairer regime.</P>
      <P>The EU does a reasonably good job on overall conservation and consequently we are able to stay in business, even though it is very difficult and we have many arguments about quotas etc. We want to regulate the system further to ensure it is fairer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the time is ripe for an end to the flag of convenience policy which was introduced a few years ago to the detriment of the Irish fishing fleet? Has he made any representations to his European counterparts to change this rule and abolish the flag of convenience? It is a licence for marauding our fishing stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We can directly prevent the use of flags of convenience as licences to maraud and attack stocks, which is what we are trying to do. We are being reasonably successful in getting the Community to provide new measures and tighter, more stringent controls. The package which will be implemented from 1 July will go as far as it is possible to go in monitoring vessels at sea. In Norway, vessels can check in at sea. That can be done by a single country outside the Community but cannot be done within it. We have come as near to that as we can, by making ships report as they enter different blocs of the sea. This approach has been welcomed although we have to see it operating in practice.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that for every pound of EU funding received in Ireland, much more leaves in terms of the value of our fish, taken by non-Irish boats from our waters? I agree with him that the enforcement of regulations for flag of convenience boats is important. What will the inspectors do when they visit Spain that will help enforcement? Does he agree that the essence of this problem is the level of resources which can be provided for fishery protection? If spending is diverted from fishery protection to the NATO &ndash; led Partnership for Peace, what effect will this have on fishery protection, given its dependence on the Navy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no diversion from fishery protection. The area of fishing is an old problem. Some countries have wiped out their fish completely, as well as their coastal communities. The EU has been successful and is proud of that success, despite the arguments. I appreciate how important it is to maintain this success. I do not see the problem to which the Deputy referred, certainly not with the Council of Ministers and the EU as they operate currently. The other issue is a separate one. All countries are interested in maintaining the free stocks.</P>

      <P>The Portuguese, French and Spanish were fishing here before we joined the Community. I know we are talking about our waters, but they traditionally fished there up to that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's other question, our inspectors will compare the methodologies of inspection and their frequency with those of the Spanish. One point I forgot to mention is that in future any of these vessels coming into port will <Col N="597" /> have to give four hours, instead of two hours, notice. A problem which was highlighted in an RTE programme was that after the offices had closed, the inspectors checked another port because no other ships were due to come in; however a fax was sent in after the office had closed stating that a ship would be coming in two hours later. This has been extended, at our request, to four hours which makes it more difficult to operate that type of system. The inspectors' visit is to ensure that what is being done here will be done on a similar basis in Spain and if it is not we will want to know why from the Commission. There is no point in us carrying out surveillance if others are not doing it honestly. This arrangement is a breakthrough and it will be helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 45 together. The Department has an extensive list of proposals on hand for fishery harbour infrastructure development. Proposals have been submitted over recent years by fishery harbour users, including fishermen, processors and the aquaculture industry as well as local authorities. In addition, the Department has identified upgrading and developmental projects at key centres of fisheries activity around the coast. It is estimated that the total investment cost of these proposals would exceed £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just over £8 million was allocated towards the development of fishery harbour infrastructure and facilities under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-9. This funding has supported much needed investment in infrastructure and ice plant facilities at the fishery harbour centres and other priority locations. To the end of 1998 approximately £7.6 million has been invested in fishery harbours under the Operational Programme. The demand and need for infrastructu<Col N="598" /> ral works has been significantly in excess of available funding to date.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 1999 Estimates I have secured an exceptional increase in funding for priority fishery harbours development works. Capital funding for the programme has been increased by 148 per cent to £7.35 million. I have also committed, with the agreement of my colleague the Minister for Finance, an additional £3 million expenditure this year on small fishery harbours and landing places around the coast. The funding available for fishery harbours development in 1999 represents an increase of more than 300 per cent over previous years. I have already indicated the immediate priorities for investment are Killybegs, Burtonport, Greencastle, Dingle and Castletownbere as well as some smaller works in fishery harbours. The overall Fishery Harbour Capital Programme 1999 is being finalised and I will announce full details shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious there is a huge gap between the available and the necessary resources to implement this programme. The Minister indicated the overall cost is £50 million while only £8 million is provided under the Operational Programme. While extra funding has been allocated in the 1999 Estimates, it still falls far short of what is required. When is it envisaged the programme will be completed in these important harbours? What is the position in Killybegs, which the Minister visited during the summer of 1997 when great plans were announced for its development? When will that port be developed and reach its full potential for the fishing fleet and offshore activities which may be in the pipeline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coopers and Lybrand report which has been published shows the need for development and some important remedial works. The total estimated cost of these works and of the new berthage facilities is of the order of £20 million. Killybegs is of crucial importance as a fishery port, leading to some 3,000 jobs in the region. The work is ongoing and will continue. Work on the steel piles, which is expensive, will continue on the existing piers which were in a dangerous condition. Site investigations are under way and the necessary money has been provided. We are looking also at the possibility of a public and private partnership in relation to the new berthage facilities. I appreciate the importance of providing facilities for any future developments out into the Atlantic. Killybegs is well placed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the smaller harbours, Donegal County Council has carried out an assessment and has put forward various projects. It wishes to undertake improvements in a whole range of harbours from Portnablagh to Rannagh Pier, Moville, Woodquarter Pier, Bruckless, Ballysaggart, Maughergallen, Ballywhoriskey, Bunagee, Portmore, Rathmullan Pier. All this work cannot be done immediately. Out of the extra money <Col N="599" /> provided I hope to consider some of these as part of the 1999 programme.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister of State's reluctance to say too much about this matter.

The situation in the last few years, particularly this year, is becoming critical. In previous years up to 1,600 people were employed in onshore processing, but only a fraction of that number is now thus employed. That has serious implications for the economy of south west Donegal.

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable incremental progress since I tasked the Central Fisheries Board with the implementation of the water quality action plan. Last year saw a welcome investment in new equipment for water sampling analysis by the Central Fisheries Board. The CFB and regional boards also worked assiduously to improve dialogue and co-operation between the boards and the other relevant State agencies as well as the farming organisations. The publication of codes of practice by the IFA on silage effluent control and phosphate usage was a welcome and important initiative.</P>
      <P>Last summer, I authorised the regional fisheries boards to take on a team of temporary environmental officers during the critical &ldquo;fish kill&rdquo; period. These temporary teams were deployed in surveying river stretches in their area with a bad history of pollution incidents and liaising with farmers to encourage and assist them to prevent pollution. This proved a practical and effective initiative on the ground.</P>
      <P>Last autumn I approved the appointment by the Central Fisheries Board of an environmental and catchment management co-ordinator for 12 months to drive and co-ordinate delivery of the water quality plan and the catchment management pilot projects. The co-ordinator took up the appointment in early January. The inland fisheries forum on water quality representing all relevant interests is scheduled to hold its first meeting in the first quarter of 1999 and will serve as a platform for information exchange, strategy review and co-ordination between all the players.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> Arrangements are in hand in the Central Fisheries Board to establish the mobile emergency response unit which will assist in the co-ordination and mobilisation of resources in responding to fish kills. A free phone system on pollution awareness will also be set up for the 1999 season in the Central Fisheries Board. The co-ordinator will also review and make recommendations on the penalties for pollution related offences. We must ensure such penalties have the maximum deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>The level of fish kills due to pollution incidents in 1998 was the lowest since the 1980s. There were 29 fish kills reported last year, involving approximately 23,000 fish, compared with 39 fish kills in 1997, involving 200,000 fish. Last summer's bad weather and high water levels were contributory factors, but I am also satisfied that the action we are taking to raise awareness, tackle problems and improve co-ordination of pollution prevention and response is paying dividends.</P>
    <P>I have continuously stressed the importance of close co-operation between the fisheries boards, local authorities and all other relevant agencies and farming organisations. I am confident the level of co-operation and co-ordination achieved in the last 18 months can be further enhanced and that continued implementation of the water quality action plan will contribute significantly to the national effort to prevent, as well as respond effectively to, pollution of our rivers and lakes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the positive steps to improve water quality. Does the Minister of State agree many farmers will have to invest considerable resources in farmyard pollution measures but, given the CAP reform proposals and the present climate in farming, the resources might not be available? Does he agree it is fundamentally important to secure as much finance as possible for the control of farmyard pollution scheme to encourage farmers to make the necessary investment?</P>
      <P>The number of fish kills in 1998 indicates a welcome trend. However, the Minister of State must also be concerned about the role of large industries. There was a major fish kill recently which was linked to a successful company. The measures and controls are operated by the regional fisheries boards which have a good working relationship with the farmers who live on or near river banks, the ICMSA, the IFA and other farming bodies. That is good. However, are the same controls and restrictions applied to industry to ensure the mechanisms they have in place do not lead to the type of pollution we saw recently? What measures are in place to deal with industrial pollution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with the Deputy's remarks and I thank him for his compliment on the water quality action plan. It is in everybody's interest to improve water quality. A total of 23,000 fish is still too many. There were contributory factors in the improvement from 1997. I will <Col N="603" /> not pray for a bad summer this year, but I hope even fewer fish will be killed.</P>
      <P>Being a farmer, I am aware of the implications of CAP reform. It is vital that farmers are given assistance to provide a pollution control enterprise on their farms. Without an incentive it will be difficult to encourage them to do so because there is no profit for the farmer in pollution control measures <i>per se</i>.  We have to encourage them and the way to do that is to provide some incentive. I will talk to the Minister about that and, as somebody with first-hand information, the Deputy can be assured I will make a strong case.</P>
      <P>There is little we can do about the natural occurrences in 1997. The Deputy suggested that industries may not be monitored properly or that they are not taking sufficient care, and that this was widespread across all sectors, including farming. In Wexford County Council there is liaison among the council, the ICMSA and the IFA and that is working well. Closer liaison should be established between the industries and the various organisations and that should be monitored on a continuing basis. The majority of industries are very responsible. They do not want to get a bad name for whatever reason because it will reflect on them regardless of their product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate even though I come from the southern part of the country. I welcome the Minister's initiative in setting up this new body. For many years it appeared to outside observers that the health care area in Dublin and the surrounding area was chaotic. There seemed to be a total lack of co-ordination and, in many cases, co-operation between the voluntary sector and the health boards. This initiative, therefore, is long overdue and I welcome it. Action was needed to provide the best possible service to the public in the most efficient and value for money fashion.</P>
      <P>Matters extraneous to the Bill were referred to today. In complimenting the Minister, I welcome some changes which the Minister has facilitated through the Finance Bill. An issue that has troubled me for a long time is that of medical cards for the elderly. I welcome the change which will double the income levels allowed to facilitate people over the age of 70. In the Southern Health Board that will mean that most of the additional 10,000 people in Cork and Kerry over the age of 70 will automatically be entitled to medical cards. That is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Bill we are talking about a very large area with more than 1.3 million people but the principles are the same in regard to efficiency, co-operation and co-ordination. I have been chairman of the Southern Health Board on numerous occasions over the past 12 years. That health board caters for half a million people and we try to maximise the benefits of the funding and the personnel available, not for the <Col N="605" /> health board, Ministers or Deputies but for the patients. That has not always been the case in the Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    <P>Much disquiet has been expressed about the Eastern Health Board by people in other health board areas and this was never more apparent than when we examined the question of the appointment of consultants. It appeared to those of us outside the Eastern Health Board region &ndash; the Southern Health Board found itself short of 46 posts four or five years ago &ndash; that cosy relationships existed in and around the Dublin area which resulted in a greater number of appointments being made there than in other health board areas. I welcome the co-operation that will be introduced under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter broadly welcomed the Bill but referred to some areas of concern to him. The allocations to the voluntary hospitals was one such area. My experience in the Southern Health Board is that the single funding agency has been in vogue for the past year and a half and has worked successfully. This is an area from which lessons can be learned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the numbers on the board, I would be concerned that this might make it unwieldy. The board I chaired had 33 members which was a sufficient number to enable it to work in an effective manner, particularly at public meetings. I emphasise that one or two disruptive members can cause chaos on any board, regardless of its size, but the question of the number of people on boards should be examined.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy McManus, and was amazed at her opening attack on one of the initiatives of the Minister of State, namely, the setting up of the health board chief executive officers' executive. I do not know if Deputy McManus has been working in the health area in the recent past but she should be aware that this grouping has existed for many years on a voluntary basis. The eight chief executive officers meet on a regular basis and bring forward recommendations which are worked on by the Department and the Minister. One of the initiatives they produced was the health gain unit and they also set the guidelines for medical card qualification. This grouping is in place and Deputy McManus and others should be aware it has been working efficiently.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus seemed to be trying to create a scare in regard to buying and leasing property and other issues dealt with in the Bill. This is a standard requirement when a body is being set up. I presume it is office space, etc., that is being referred to and I am sure the Minister will deal with that question. That aspect concerned me because I had worked for a number of years to get greater co-operation among the chief executive officers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy McManus is not suggesting a return to the bad old days when chief executive officers did solo runs and tried to gain the edge for their own regions. We cannot return to that. <Col N="606" /> We want a standard of health care which will apply equally in Donegal, Cork or Dublin and qualifying standards on other issues should be dealt with on that basis. That is the reason the co-operation of the eight chief executive officers is necessary.</P>
    <P>In that context it should be pointed out that the new legislation introduced by the Minister for Health and Children has placed enormous responsibility on the chief executive officers both in terms of financial accountability and in other areas. They need support and a proper working relationship to deliver on the demands for accountability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transparency which the Bill offers. These people can be brought before the Public Accounts Committee and are responsible to other bodies. That is a change. We should continue on that route, not go back to the days of eight boards doing their own thing.</P>
    <P>I worried the Minister might back off from establishing this executive. There was a reference to non-elected personnel. We deal with these people every day. They are highly efficient, competent and professional and now they are accountable as well.</P>
    <P>The health boards have stepped back from policy decisions. The new format requires them to present a programme of services for the year before the budget is allocated, but the boards do not prioritise their services within that budget. Most of the public meetings are held up by trivial matters rather than discussing policy and priorities. That is the function of the boards and they have shied away from it. The Minister should be mindful of that when looking at the composition of the new board and ensure that it spends its time deciding on the best policy approach and the priorities.</P>
    <P>The elderly and the handicapped have been left behind. They found that they and their consultants were competing with modern costly technology and specialties. They lost that battle in the general scramble for funding at all levels and did not get the opportunity to state their case like some of the more high profile specialties. The Minister is targeting funding for these groups and the new board should continue in that fashion. We know that the elderly and those suffering from Alzheimer's disease will need greater support in the future. If we do what we have done in the past and give the funding to the existing specialties, there will be nothing extra done for the elderly. The Tallaght solution is the easy way out. Those of us who stayed within our annual budget want to ensure that the favourite son does not get the lion's share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy will not be surprised to hear me say that there were some of us who felt that the Southern Health Board had not done too badly and that sometimes it was at the root of some problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the result of the work done by the Task Force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority which was set up by my colleague, <Col N="607" /> Deputy Noonan. The report of that task force became available shortly after the 1997 general election. Today we are looking at what the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has done with the report. My colleague, Deputy Shatter, has given it a qualified welcome and he is justified in doing so.</P>
    <P>Something is lacking in the approach. I am aware that a particular need was identified in the eastern region but I wonder if everything is perfect in the other health board regions. Is there a need to look at their structures with a view to achieving the same objectives as the Minister has set out for the eastern region?</P>
    <P>The Minster spoke of the need for radical structural reform in the health services in the eastern region and mentioned the core problems which had been identified in discussions of that need. He spoke of the absence of a single authority with responsibility for planning, delivery and co-ordination of services, over-centralised decision making and the need for better communication and co-operation. Those are all things with which we can identify but are none of those problems to be found in the other health board areas? </P>
    <P>The Minister contends there is a recognised need for radical reform of the structure of the health authorities as set out in this Bill. I can see the advantages if they work in the way they are supposed to work. There is also the new executive. This is not just a question of co-operation between the chief executive officers. They have a more crucial role in the operation of the system than simple co-operation. There is a question mark over that. Do we need to institutionalise that executive in the manner set out in this Bill in order to achieve the objectives?</P>
    <P>There is another question which has not been addressed. There is the structure of health boards, a new structure being proposed for the eastern region and the Department of Health and Children. In many ways we have two parallel administrations in the health system. Without wanting to criticise anyone, that parallel administration system has not served us well. The hepatitis C problem was not detected or prevented in spite of the two parallel administrations.</P>
    <P>So that people do not feel I am picking on the health sector, the same problem can be seen in defence. Again there are parallel administrations &ndash; the General Staff in Army Headquarters and the Department of Defence, one of which is more equal than the other, and one of which tries to second guess the other. This causes difficult things to happen. The parallel administration did not prevent the emergence of the major problem of hearing impairment claims, which will cost us dear.</P>
    <P>This is an area where one thinks that having a belt and braces approach would be safer but both defence and health have had problems with parallel administrations and each has proved a very <Col N="608" /> difficult nut to crack. It is time that issue was addressed, particularly as the Minister has articulated his objective of providing local services closer to the point of delivery. The Minister's objective for the new structure of more involvement from local communities in the planning and organisation of the health services is laudable. I am not sure that can be done efficiently and effectively with two parallel administrations still in place. That is not addressed here, but it should be. I hope it will be debated before too long.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Eastern Regional Health Authority, area authorities and bodies delivering services must also be addressed. Provision is made in the Bill for a direct relationship between the authority and a list of bodies in the Schedule. Many of those bodies will be familiar to Members, but there are other bodies which provide very important services that are not included. The bodies included in the Schedule have a relationship with the Department, while other bodies have different relationships with the health boards. The Minister should think again about the number of bodies in the Schedule. The Bill allows the Minister to change his mind about the bodies included in the Schedule, but he has an opportunity now to amend the Bill to achieve a certain result.</P>
    <P>That result relates to four bodies which work in the general area of handicap that provide sterling service. I will be forgiven for mentioning the Kildare Association of parents and friends of handicapped people, KARE, first. Cheeverstown House, Sunbeam House and Peamount Hospital are the other organisations involved. I know KARE particularly well and the others perhaps less well, but they all provide a very valuable service. They are increasingly involved in meeting what appears to be a growing demand.</P>
    <P>There are three reasons for the growth in that demand. As the population expands, almost inevitably the number of people who need these kinds of services tend to increase. The second reason is independent of population increase. As more and more people become aware of the services available, people who had not previously looked for a service begin to seek it. The third factor is that improvements in the general health of our population mean a great number of people who suffer from various handicaps and disabilities now have an increased life expectancy. We all welcome this, but it means the extent of the problem with which we have to deal in a given population is increasing.</P>
    <P>All these factors have produced extra demand for services and the provision of those services by Governments and public service agencies has not kept up with the demand. That criticism applies to Governments generally over a long period, I am not making a particular point of it so far. These other organisations have stepped in to fill the breach and find themselves under increasing <Col N="609" /> pressure. They often have to provide levels of service in excess of what they have agreed with public authorities and fund those services from their own resources. I am not arguing that they should receive 100 per cent funding for everything they do. There is a case for saying that, although there is a limit to the extent of the public purse. However, in some cases they provide services that come within the remit of public policy but which are not funded publicly. They are funded from private resources and other fundraising activities carried out by these organisations. These bodies need assurance that they will be able to continue to provide this service. Some currently have a relationship with the Department of Health and Children; I understand they are the organisations listed in the Second Schedule. Others have relationships with the health boards and are not included in the Schedule. I understand these are the bodies the Minister may add to the Schedule. I urge him to include the bodies I have mentioned in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>The four organisations I mentioned provide a service in the same way as those mentioned in the Schedule. They have undertaken serious obligations and should be treated in the same way as those included in the Schedule. I mention those four bodies deliberately because of the nature and extent of their activities. KARE, for example, has a budget of £3 million per annum and is a very substantial organisation. Do not discount anything I say because that organisation is near where I live; I speak in genuine admiration of it. We get extremely good value for money for that £3 million. I know the same can be said of organisations in other health board areas, but KARE gives us very good value for money. These organisations are very effective and a large part of their work is voluntary.</P>
    <P>I make the case, therefore, that they should be treated in the same way as the organisations listed in the Schedule. Some of the organisations listed in the Schedule provide services from their own resources that match the services for which they are publicly funded. They meet a demand the public purse does not stretch to cover and all of them have this in common.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill for dealing with these organisations. Unless I misread it, similar considerations apply to organisations included in the Schedule and those that are not. They must have a two part service agreement with either the Eastern Regional Health Authority or the area health authority. The first part consists of a long-term agreement of three to five years which sets out the general principles relating to standards of efficiency, effectiveness and quality by which the parties must agree to abide and the second is an annual agreement that specifies the service to be provided in respect of that year and the level of funding to be made available therefor. Why does the agreement have two parts; one relating to <Col N="610" /> principles and standards of efficiency over five years and another relating to funding on an annual basis? The Minister said these agreements would ensure a degree of continuity and financial security for providers.</P>
    <P>I take that with more than a grain of salt. The part of the agreement that provides for standards of quality and efficiency over five years will certainly provide an element of continuity, but annual budgeting does not provide the kind of continuity that these organisations need. I propose we align the two and provide budgeting for these organisations, both on and off the schedule, over a period of three to five years, similar to the quality and standards provisions of these agreements. I suggest this because these organisations also must be able to plan how to provide their services, including the continuity of a service which comes within the remit of the first part. It is often the case that if they undertake to do something new or additional in the first year, the requirement for it will grow in subsequent years. Limiting them to annual funding means that once a year every year they must have a long and difficult discussion with the other party to the agreement, which also may have difficulty in forecasting its funding over a period. Particularly in regard to services for disability and handicap, we need to be able to look to the future in the provision of services to ensure we do the kind of job we all want done in this sector. I urge the Minister to align the two parts of the agreements and put the funding on the same multi-year basis as the agreement on standards, quality, etc.</P>
    <P>Another matter related to the transition between the present circumstances to the new position which the Bill sets out to provide is the accumulated deficits of these organisations. I have not been privy to the discussions between these bodies but I understand they feel that part of what is proposed in the implementation of the Bill is that these accumulated deficits would be written off when the transition is made. Perhaps the Minister could confirm whether that is the case. For the four organisations I mentioned, and no doubt for others, that would be a major boost to their morale and would seriously ease the burden on them in considering what activities they will carry out over the next few years. It is difficult for any organisation in this field to start the year with a substantial deficit to which it may add over the coming year, not through extravagance or carelessness but because once it is involved in the provision of these services, there is a vacuum effect which sucks it along, and it is impossible to deny a service to people who so patently need it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware &ndash; although it may not be relevant to him &ndash; that there is one problem for people with disabilities which he could easily solve. There is provision in our current practice for a domiciliary care allowance for children with disabilities but it is not paid for the <Col N="611" /> first two years of a child's life. A small number of families have a major difficulty with profoundly handicapped children and get no assistance for the first two years of their child's life &ndash; and, unfortunately, these children often have a short life expectancy. Several times in the past year the Minister told me he was reviewing the position; I ask him to decide now to make the domiciliary care allowance for the first two years of those children's lives, thereby to provide some psychological and small economic help to parents who find themselves in a tragic position.</P>
    <P>Lest it be thought I agree with her, I have serious reservations about Deputy McManus's proposal that local representative members of these structures should be directly elected. We should look at that in the wider context of reform of local government. If, as I hope we do, we restore real powers to the people we elect on 11 June next, they should be involved in the provision of health services, and for that reason the idea of separate elections to these authorities does not commend itself.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined his reasons for the changes in the Bill, among which was changing demographics &ndash; the population on the east coast has increased significantly. He said these changes would return decision making to the lowest effective level and powers would be devolved. When I hear about devolution and decentralisation I am reminded of the experiment &ndash; that is what I call it &ndash; of splitting up Dublin local authorities, so that we now have Fingal, South County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, and Dublin Corporation. We must ask ourselves, in reference to Deputy Dukes' remarks, whether we did decentralise, whether power was returned to local authorities or whether we merely created an extra layer of bureaucracy. I hold the latter opinion, and unfortunately I see the same thing in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motto of the Department of Health and Children has never been &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;, rather &ldquo;big is beautiful&rdquo;, as we have seen most recently in Tallaght Hospital, which has eaten money. We will see this more often. The Minister said he wanted value for money and mentioned we were spending £1.2 billion in this region. If that is the case, and the Minister is serious in stating that service provision will be on the basis of a service agreement, we must examine how the Department of Health and Children tenders out projects, because we could get value for money in that area. I have not been happy with that process. In hospital waste management, for instance, <Col N="612" /> we do not have value for money, nor have we examined the most environmentally friendly options.</P>
    <P>Likewise, when the Minister talks about changing demographics and bringing services closer to the point of delivery, there is a prime example in my constituency of this not being done, and we have seen a total lack of forward planning and strategy. Two hospitals in the area were closed, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street, but they are now required because of changing demographics; many new families with children are moving into the area but they have been left without services because everything has been moved to Tallaght. I do not suggest that Tallaght does not deserve a hospital but we do not need a super hospital consuming huge amounts of money while the population of the inner city is increasing but is without acute hospital services, which we need in Dublin South-East and the inner city. That oversight has resulted in waste.</P>
    <P>This is ultimately a question of vision and attitude. We can change the structures, but it is difficult to change the mindset. The mindset of the Department is based on too much bureaucracy. We need to move away from the concept of a Department for illness. It is not so much a Department for health as a Department for illness.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question I was told that one of the reasons there are fewer nurses in Dublin is that it is a less attractive place to live. Given the traffic gridlock and the price of houses, many nurses are more inclined to live in the country, but this is symptomatic of a wider problem. I tried to address this problem this morning when Mr. Jerry O'Dwyer attended the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I asked him about the Department having a wider remit and not focusing only on the symptoms but the need to examine the root causes of many of our health problems.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of degenerative cancer and cardio-vascular diseases in Dublin and other parts of the country. How do we tackle them? We seem to home in on the health dangers associated with smoking. I agree it is a serious problem, but there are also other problems. It is ironic that the problem of traffic gridlock is being put forward as one of the reasons there are fewer nurses in Dublin, but that problem is also associated with the incidence of cancers. The WHO stated that 80 per cent of cancers are environmentally linked. While we are concentrating on curbing smoking, advertising of tobacco products and where people can smoke, in many polluted cities of the world children are smoking the equivalent of two packets of cigarettes per day by breathing in air pollution. There is a serious problem in Dublin where the level of air pollution breaches <Col N="613" /> the limit set by the WHO, but there are no curbs on car advertising.</P>

      <P>It is all very well to talk about change, but there is a problem concerning the Department's attitude. Some systems could be easily changed; if not, their impact will cost a good deal of money in the long-term. Cancer care costs a great deal of money. We need to examine the root causes of the problem. There has been talk about antibiotic resistance and the increasing problem of MRSA in our hospitals. We could cut down on health care expenditure if we promoted more home births. These issues need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I was told at the committee this morning there is an inter-agency approach and that the Department of Health and Children is communicating with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, but I do not see that. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is spending a mere £20,000 on tackling the problem of air pollution in this city while that problem is giving rise to many more cancers. It is also affecting the elderly and there has been an increase in the rate of morbidity. While all of these issues count, such issues are put to one side because of the way in which we compartmentalise the health issue. Therefore, our approach to these issues needs to be examined. I agree I may have digressed slightly.</P>
      <P>People on the front line identified that a problem with the Bill is that voluntary hospitals in the Dublin region, Tallaght, Beaumont, the Mater, St. James's, previously negotiated directly with the Department for their funding. With the introduction of the regional health authority, such negotiations will be with the new health authorities, but this will create another layer of bureaucracy and more barriers. The provision of regional cancer centres was promised, but I doubt if that promise will be delivered on. These buzz words, &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;devolution of power&rdquo; have been used in connection with this Bill, but that will have to be tested because I do not believe that is ensured in this Bill. I hear the rhetoric, but it will be interesting to see what transpires in practice. It will also be interesting to see how much money we will save. I suspect we will end up spending much more.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> This Bill seeks to reorganise the structure of the health service authorities in the greater Dublin area, Kildare <Col N="614" /> and Wicklow. A reorganisation is necessary, but I am not convinced by the proposals in this Bill. The Minister has lost an opportunity to bring innovative thinking to bear on how the health services should be structured and run in the eastern region. This Bill provides for a carving up of the Eastern Health Board area into smaller areas using the old style structure and the establishment of an umbrella body. It is regrettable much more radical thinking was not brought to bear on the organisation of the health services in the eastern region with a view to providing a health service that would be much closer to people who use it, allowing them to have an input in its organisation structure. On a related issue, I regret the Bill does not refer, in a radical sense, to the funding of the new structures.</P>
      <P>The eastern authority will consist of members of registered professions, doctors, dentists, nurses and pharmacists, representatives of the voluntary service providers and ministerial nominees of whom 30 out of 55 will be public representatives. I question the time honoured arrangement by which local authorities nominate members to health boards. I witnessed the election of these representatives over many years, but the manner in which this arrangement operates is a rather cynical exercise. Eastern Health Board nominations are viewed as a sinecure or something allocated in the divvying up of various positions to which local councils elect people. They are not based on any consideration of the qualifications required by those who serve on a health board.</P>
      <P>Specific elections to health boards directly by communities in the catchment area should be seriously considered as well as a method by which the local resident organisations, various caring organisations and those who use the health services could be democratically elected to the co-ordinating boards. It is regrettable that the Minister has not made provision for the representation of patients or potential patients on the overall board or the three local area boards. Surely that would be in line with current thinking in respect of those for whom the service is provided and it should have been included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is open to question is the fact that, if this structure is put into place, we do not know how it will operate without having foreknowledge of the funding proposals that will be put in place by the Minister and his Department in regard to these three areas and the overall regional authority. People who use the health services in these catchment areas will be apprehensive about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 34,000 people awaiting elective surgery at present. Some of them have been on waiting lists for a number of years and there are many cases of people, particularly the elderly &ndash; whose later years could have <Col N="615" /> been made more comfortable through elective surgery &ndash; dying before their turn arrived. That created terrible trauma and bitterness on the part of the families, relatives and loved ones they left behind. Difficulties with waiting lists should have been related to the restructuring process because the question of resources and funding is indivisible from that of restructuring.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have witnessed the scandal of people, the old and the sick, lying on trolleys in Dublin hospitals because wards have been closed down. All public representatives could quote many tragic and difficult examples of this from personal experience. I recently made a strong plea to a consultant surgeon at a prominent Dublin hospital on behalf of a constituent who needed urgent neurosurgery. I will not mention the names of those involved but I will quote from the letter the surgeon sent to me in reply to my request. He stated:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are fewer neurosurgeons in public practice now than there were in the 1980s and this has led to the accumulation of very long waiting lists. An additional difficulty is that there have been ward closures during the summer and we have now entered a period where there are insufficient theatre staff. This has led to a 25 per cent reduction in the theatre facilities available to me for November, December and January and I suspect it may well prove that the difficulties will continue after that. Seventy three per cent of the admissions to the National Neurological Centre last year were emergencies and the 25 per cent theatre cutback effectively means I am only treating emergencies at present.</P>
    <P>That is the stark position which obtains. The reason for it is that the percentage of GDP spent on health in this country, relative to other EU countries, has been steadily declining and falling behind. On the frequent occasions when he refers to the large amounts of money being invested in the health services, the Minister tends to forget that.</P>
    <P>Dr. Miriam Wylie, head of the health policy research centre at the ESRI, in a recently published book pointed out that while Sweden and Germany ranked as the biggest spenders on health throughout the 1980s, the Irish Estimates show that the rank occupied by Ireland was progressively declining. She further stated that the proportion of GDP devoted to health in Ireland ranked joint fifth relative to the other member states in 1985 and 11th in 1990. The question of funding is inseparable from that of structuring and that should have been addressed in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The move to abolish duty free within the European Union is a reflection of the sort of rigid and inflexible decision-making processes that make many people throughout Europe cynical about the European project. Someone somewhere in the European bureaucracy decided that the concept of duty free is incompatible with the principle of the single market and, therefore, it must go, irrespective of the implications for jobs, the impact on the cost of air and sea travel and the consequences for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>As an island on the periphery of Europe with a high level of travel between here and other European countries and a tourism industry that is crucial to our economy, the proposal to abolish duty free was clearly a matter of vital interest. The Taoiseach is justifiably regarded as a shrewd operator with his finger on the political pulse. However, his decision as a member of the Council of Finance Ministers in 1991 to agree to the abolition of duty free must rank as one of the greatest political errors of his career. Make no mistake, the damage was done in 1991 when Deputy Bertie Ahern went in with his hands up and surrendered without a struggle. Since then we have been fighting an uphill battle to recover ground.</P>
      <P>I accept that in the past year the Government has at last begun to realise the potential consequences of the 1991 decision for Ireland and, along with the Governments of a number of other countries, it began to seek support to have that disastrous decision reversed. However, it now appears that a report requested by European leaders at their summit last December from the European Commission will reject pleas for any reprieve for duty free facilities. The Government must not allow this to happen. This is a matter of significant interest to the people of Europe and the final decision should be taken by their democratically elected Governments, not by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why any Government or international body, such as the European Union, would deliberately put people out of work. Sometimes Governments have to make difficult choices that can lead to job losses but it is shocking that any institution could to take a decision, purely for dogmatic reasons, to jeopardise what some sources in industry claim could be as many as 11,000 jobs here and 140,000 in the wider EU. Even the Commission report, which wildly underestimates the level of job losses, accepts that there will be 20,000 job losses <Col N="617" /> throughout the European Union, 1,200 of them in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Duty free has been an important element in air and sea travel for almost 50 years. It has stimulated trade, created jobs and helped to keep travel costs down. As night follows day, its abolition will reduce trade, jeopardise jobs and increase travel costs.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is one of Ireland's most successful and go ahead companies. Its expertise is in demand throughout the world and it operates airport shops in the most unlikely places. However, its core business is running Irish airports. Duty free sales account for approximately 40 per cent of Aer Rianta profits. If that revenue goes it will have to be made up in some other way.</P>
    <P>The same is likely to happen in ferry travel, an area where much of the travel is for leisure purposes, often day trips. Ferry companies estimate that every 10 per cent increase in fares leads to a decrease of approximately 10 per cent in the numbers travelling.</P>
    <P>The knock-on effects in the tourism industry are likely to be dramatic. The Irish Duty Free Association has estimated that the abolition of duty free sales could lead to an increase of 30 per cent in travel costs and a consequent loss of 760,000 visitors to Ireland each year. Some £50 million worth of goods were sold by Aer Rianta duty free shops in Ireland and the total Irish duty free sales market is double that. A huge proportion of this consists of Irish made products. For example, 20 per cent of Irish Distillers whiskey sales are made through duty free shops.</P>
    <P>The free movement of people is one of the cornerstones on which the EU is supposed to be built. Is it not a great irony that the EU is now proposing to do away with something that makes travel cheaper and more accessible to the majority of people? The Government must challenge the Commission on this issue. The Taoiseach should immediately lobby for support to have the Commission report rejected and should use the opportunity presented by the Berlin summit to lobby each Head of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach played a primary role in gaining an extension of duty free sales to 1999. It was disingenuous of the Deputy to suggest otherwise.</P>
      <P>This House continues to show a great interest in the question of duty free and tax free sales to EU travellers, after June 1999, with this Adjournment debate. On the basis of decisions already taken, duty free sales for EU travellers will end at end June 1999 unless another agreement is reached. We believe that is wrong and unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing debates both here and in the Seanad, where the issue has also been raised on several occasions, testify to the continuing and <Col N="618" /> unique efforts of the Irish, especially the Government, to have the decision on duty free sales reversed and to support the efforts of those employed in the affected sectors to get this decision put on hold or dropped altogether.</P>
    <P>Ireland has raised this issue at various levels over the years. We were the first to raise it, and many derided us for our persistence when at first we got no support. We continually called for an EU wide study, which the Commission would not undertake then and we have also called for a basic rethink of the decision and for an extension of time.</P>
    <P>Ireland has raised this issue so often at all levels and at various EU Councils, including at the European summits over the years, that we have been recognised as the leaders of the campaign. Not only this Government but its predecessor in office has raised this matter in EU fora.</P>
    <P>I welcome the bipartisan interest in and approach to this topic that has always been shown in the House. The Irish transport workers, airport and ferry staff, who of necessity have great interest in this subject, have helped greatly in altering the minds of people in Europe on this topic. They have lobbied vigorously and used their links with workers in related businesses in the other EU states to mobilise cross-frontier opposition. It has been a special form of partnership between Government, trade and employee interests.</P>
    <P>We have raised this question at all levels with the relevant Commission officials, including the President of the Commission, Mr. Santer, with individual Commissioners and with officials of the EU institutions. We have not neglected the European Parliament either.</P>
    <P>The 1991-92 decision to end duty free sales was confirmed by the Commission at ECOFIN on 19 May 1998 and supported by the majority. The Commission was then strongly supported by a number of member states, who did not wish to see the original decision revisited. At the 19 May meeting, however, a number of countries gave support for the first time to the Irish call for a study. More recently we seem to have seen large scale conversions to our view.</P>
    <P>With the change of Government in Germany, the Minister for Finance immediately wrote to his German colleague on this matter, as he did to several other EU Finance Ministers. The Taoiseach contacted the leaders of the other member states also. The Minister has received a letter from the German Minister for Finance, Mr. Lafontaine, today which confirmed German concern about the employment aspects of the decision to end duty free sales. I am sure it will influence his handling of the issue at ECOFIN.</P>
    <P>France has recently redoubled efforts to get a change of mind. Last summer Mr. Capet reported to the French Prime Minister. He represents the Pas de Calais region and he suggested that the decision be revisited. That report brought France <Col N="619" /> on to our side. The French have also reopened debate at the ECOFIN Council. I was delighted to see them row in fully behind our efforts by launching their own efforts to have the decision reversed.</P>
    <P>Last November the EU Commission issued a document to explain the scope of the existing Community measures capable of offsetting, regional, local or social difficulties which may arise from the abolition of duty free sales as from 1 July 1999, in accordance with the unanimous decision adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1991 and in the context of Community assistance. It was widely felt that this document was not an adequate response to the problem, and that an extension of time was essential. At the Vienna Summit the EU Heads of State and Government considered this issue in depth. I was there with the Taoiseach and have the highest regard for the direct way in which he dealt with this issue. This led to a mandate to ECOFIN Ministers and to the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to the decision of 1991 on the tax-free sales for intra-Community travellers, the European Council asked the Commission and the ECOFIN Council to examine by March 1999 the problems which could arise with regard to employment and to address on the basis of proposals from the Commission possible means of tackling these problems, including the possibility of at least a limited extension of the transitional arrangements. On the basis of a report from the Commission, expected shortly, ECOFIN will again discuss this topic at the March ECOFIN meeting.</P>
    <P>I hope the Commission will not merely restate earlier responses when it considers this matter formally in the near future. It should certainly note that the mood across Europe is moving the Irish way, for the retention of duty free and tax free shopping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter in response to a number of complaints I have received from concerned constituents. One such letter I received from an expectant woman on 23 January states:</P>
      <P>Dear Jimmy,</P>
      <P>As one of your local constituents I am writing to voice my horror at the lack of an epidural service in Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a first-time expectant woman with a baby due this month. Based on this my husband and I were faced with the choice &ndash; do we travel to Limerick or Cork where this basic service is available in January or do we opt for the choice of a 17 mile journey where the epidural may or may not be available depending on the day of the week. Surely in this day and age <Col N="620" /> these choices should not be put to any woman. The thoughts of childbirth are daunting enough without adding this unnecessary worry to any expectant woman.</P>
    <P>I am asking you to do whatever you can to make this service available as it should be on a full-time basis in Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>In the discussion document on developing a policy for women's health published in June 1995 the State's inadequate maternity service was highlighted as follows:</P>
    <P>The maternity services have been criticised for a number of reasons. Concern has been expressed about the lack of respect for the experience of giving birth, the poor continuity in medical and midwifery care for public patients, the absence of appointment systems in out-patients departments of maternity hospitals, the lack of choice for women as regards accommodation, birthing positions, pain control, unnecessary procedures, visiting times and the choice of companion during labour: As women have fewer children, they attach greater importance to the unique experience of childbirth for themselves and their partners. The vast majority of births are normal and without the complications which require medical intervention. There is a clear need for maternity hospitals to respect the unique experience of childbirth for each mother and father by giving parents as much choice as possible and by simulating a domestic environment for those with a normal labour and delivery.</P>
    <P>This choice is not available at all times in Tralee General Hospital for expectant women. On 27 January, in response to an oral question I put on this matter, the Minister stated that he was advised by the Southern Health Board that there were ongoing discussions between hospital management, the consultant anaesthetists and the consultant gynaecologists regarding the further development of the epidural service in Tralee General Hospital and that he looked forward to the conclusion of these discussions. Is there a time limit for these discussions and when will they be concluded? If discussions are not fruitful, is the Minister prepared to outline the stumbling blocks?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said he had provided an additional £1.487 million in 1999 to meet the cost of service developments, including improved midwifery staffing costs at Tralee General Hospital. My information is that extra staff for midwifery cover have not been provided recently because of midwife shortages in the hospital.</P>
    <P>One in three Kerry women go elsewhere for maternity care, including Cork, Limerick and Dublin in some cases. In an article in <i>The Kerryman</i> recently a local general practitioner, commenting on the services in Kerry, stated that a <Col N="621" /> child was delivered on the road to Cork because the mother could not have this service in Kerry. That is unacceptable. There is also the cost factor for families who have to travel to clinics in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere for pre-natal care and childbirth. It is also an emotional time for many women who must leave the comfort of their families.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take an interest in this matter. If there are problems with providing a proper epidural service in Tralee General Hospital, they should be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to this debate on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to address the House on the development of epidural services in Tralee General Hospital. The provision of epidural services is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The Minister for Health and Children is committed to the development of services in Tralee General Hospital in line with the priorities identified by the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of 1998 the Minister has provided more than £500,000 in additional funding for the development of services in the hospital. These developments include improvements to the medical and nursing staff levels in the accident and emergency departments, the appointment of an extra radiologist and associated paramedical staff to bring the new CAT scanner fully into service and an increase in the level of midwifery staff to improve services to mothers attending Tralee General Hospital. Approval was also granted for the appointment of a registrar in the obstetrics department at the hospital. The Minister will continue to provide further resources for the development of services at the hospital in line with the Southern Health Board and national policy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a limited epidural service available in Tralee General Hospital at present. The development of this service and obstetric services generally has been identified as a priority by the management of the hospital. The Southern Health Board is committed to upgrading the availability of epidural services in Tralee General Hospital. The Minister understands from the board that there are a number of issues surrounding the arrangements for the enhancement of the service which need to be agreed locally before the expansion of the service can take place. Discussions with clinical staff are currently under way to resolve a range of medical issues associated with the expansion of the service. In anticipation of the resolution of the relevant clinical issues, two anaesthetist senior house officers have been upgraded to registrar level with effect from 1 January 1999 to facilitate the availability of an epidural service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> The Minister looks forward to the conclusion of discussions with the relevant clinical staff and the Southern Health Board. He will consider any further proposals the Southern Health Board may make following the conclusion of these local discussions with a view to developing the epidural service at Tralee General Hospital. The Minister has been advised by the Southern Health Board that it is hoped to bring these discussions between hospital management, the consultant anaesthetists and the consultant obstetrician and gynaecologists about further development of this service to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, for coming here to respond to this debate.</P>
      <P>It is timely to review the effectiveness of local government in the city and county of Dublin given that it is the 100th anniversary of the establishment of local government and that almost 50 years have passed since the basic framework for local government, the City and County Managers Act, came into effect. At that time Dublin was a relatively small city contained within the two canals. However, it is now a major European capital. It needs a modern system of local government appropriate to a city with a population in excess of one million. Without a proper responsive system of government, Dublin's problems will continue to dominate the political agenda.</P>
      <P>An elected lord mayor would have to present a policy platform relevant to the needs of the capital as part of his or her election programme. That does not happen at present. A publicly elected lord mayor would have a mandate to tackle the city's problems which the present lord mayor does not have. If a lord mayor was in office for a five year term, he would have a reasonable chance of making progress on implementing his election programme. That does not happen at present.</P>
      <P>The housing crisis, traffic gridlock and planning incoherence will continue to dominate Dublin's political agenda unless there is a fundamental change in local government in Dublin. An identification of the problems besetting the capital will be futile unless an effective mechanism to deal with them is established.</P>
      <P>International experience shows that an elected lord mayor with real power and responsibility for policy to develop the capital is the best means for the development of a modern, progressive city that is worthy of the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elected mayor should have responsibility to a greater Dublin council which would also be elected by the public. A publicly elected lord mayor and city council is the best way to provide a framework to replace the capital's local government structure as set out in the 1955 Act. This <Col N="623" /> Act is grotesquely offensive to the citizens of Dublin. It embodies the assumption that the people of Dublin cannot be trusted to elect their own lord mayor and city council to provide leadership for the city and to be responsible for its implementation.</P>
    <P>At present, real power rests in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and in an unelected bureaucracy of four local authorities which control the local government of the city. It is ridiculous that issues, such as housing, planning and traffic in the greater Dublin area, are dealt with in an incoherent and piecemeal manner by four independent councils instead of one metropolitan council with a lord mayor who would have an overview of what the entire city requires. It is ridiculous that one side of a road, such as Cromwellsfort Road or Kimmage Road, is in Dublin Corporation's area, while the other side is in the county council area. The people of those communities go to the same churches and engage in the same activities, yet they are in two different areas.</P>
    <P>The message from cities such as Barcelona and New York is that elected lord mayors can get things done, reform infrastructure and greatly improve the lives of the citizens. For example, the Lord Mayor of New York is on top of the ball. He deals with the citizens' concerns as they appear on a daily basis. Barcelona is a wonderful European city which is primarily influenced by the work of its lord mayor who has been in office for a long time. Municipal Government is central to the standard of living of the one million people who live in the capital. It determines the effectiveness of the infrastructure such as transport, the standard of the environment in matters such as litter prevention and is hugely influential on the quality of life of those who depend on the local authority to provide them with the basic necessities, such as housing provision as well as in the maintenance of the housing stock. The time has come to treat the people of Dublin as citizens of a wonderful old city who are capable of taking responsibility for the control of Ireland's capital. I know there are people in the political system who fear that an election would lead to somebody outside the political class being elected lord mayor. If that is the public choice, so be it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government reform is happening now. The wide range of measures in train form a coherent programme underpinned by the following principles: implementation of a proper funding system and efficient delivery of quality ser<Col N="624" /> vices; development of local authority decision making along partnership lines; widening the role of local government and enhancement of the role of the democratically elected member.</P>
    <P>On the financial side, the new local government fund established by the Local Government Act, 1998, is in operation. This fund provides a secure income source for local government, comprising the proceeds of motor tax and a guaranteed amount from the Exchequer, which must take account of increases in local authority costs and any additional functions. A range of other initiatives to promote the efficiency agenda is under way. A new financial management system is being developed which will bring local authorities in line with private sector practice and improve flows of information to all concerned. A needs and resource study to determine equitable distribution of the local government fund among authorities is also under way.</P>
    <P>Capital investment in roads, water supply and sewage treatment is at an all time high in 1999. The 1999 provisions for local authority housing will bring the local authority housing programme to its highest level since 1986. Dublin Corporation, being the largest local authority in the country, is a major beneficiary of this increased investment.</P>
    <P>Partnership is becoming a reality in local government through the strategic policy committees which involve sectoral interests and through the work of the task force on local government and local development. Implementation of the task force report will bring local government and local development closer together. It will also provide local government, via the proposed county development board, with a strategic focus to bring together the various public sector agencies and social partners active in their area to articulate a common strategy for their city or county. Implementation of this renewal programme will not take place without the dedication and commitment of both local authority staff and elected members. The whole area of human resource management is being reviewed along with training and information support for councillors to ensure the system can meet a challenging agenda of change.</P>
    <P>A local government Bill is being prepared to underpin the renewal programme and to modernise and consolidate local government law. It will provide a sound and modern context for local authorities to deliver their services efficiently. The position of the cathaoirleach of a local authority is under consideration in the context of this legislation. Under present law she or he, and to date it is usually he, as many Members would regret, is elected annually by the members of the local authority concerned. In practice this has meant a one year term of office for the post. Almost by definition such an annual turnover is unlikely to enhance democratic leadership and <Col N="625" /> responsibility. Among the options being considered to enhance the democratic mandate are the election of the cathaoirleach directly by the people or a continuation of the present system but with a longer term than one year. Both options would see a non executive cathaoirleach within the general council-executive model. A cathaoirleach who would be in a far better position to provide leadership underpinned by an enhanced democratic mandate and supported by the SPC chairs. The legislation to be published later this year will set out the proposed arrangements as well as other measures to underline the distinctive status of local authority membership.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to ward councils. Many local authorities are now moving towards a more developed form of local area presence, with local area offices for council services and in some cases public services by other agencies also provided from the same location. This serves to bring local government closer to its customers and to improve public service delivery generally on the one stop shop principle. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will be allocating £6 million as a contribution to local authorities who are reaching out to their customers in this way.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are in effect decentralising their services supported by area committees of the council with greater potential for community engagement. While the Department of the Environment and Local Government has actively encouraged these developments, it is primarily a matter for local authorities to reorganise themselves in this way. I understand Dublin Corporation is moving in this direction and is implementing a major programme to modernise and improve its services. It has set up major area offices in both Ballymun and Ballyfermot which are aimed towards a more integrated customer oriented delivery of service to the public. These offices are having a positive impact on customer service enabling people to identify more closely with their local authority and to access services more easily.</P>
    <P>I have referred briefly to some of the measures in progress as part of the local government renewal programme. The local government Bill to be published later this year will provide a fuller opportunity to discuss the many issues arising including those raised by Deputy Upton this evening.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me to raise the unsatisfactory conditions in Clonmel Garda station. I am seeking nothing more than the public entitlement. Clonmel is the biggest inland town in the State, yet the Garda station is totally unsuitable and inadequate for the enormous amount of work <Col N="626" /> carried out there. It should be borne in mind that the structure is sound but the layout and overall facilities of the building are inadequate. The main reception area is small and dreary, overcrowded when three or more people are present. There is no sense of privacy, something to which everyone is entitled. Staff have to work in offices which to all intents and purposes are boxes, one leading from the other. There is absolutely no logical sequence to the series of box offices and stairs and this prevents the workforce from carrying out their work in the way they would like.</P>
      <P>The cost of necessary renovations would not be exorbitant but the value of any such investment would be enormous. It is unfair to expect the Garda and the staff to continue to work in these conditions. They deserve to be complimented for their patience and endurance in maintaining their work to the highest standards while working in an unsatisfactory environment. I understand that new computer equipment is due to be installed in Clonmel Garda station but the question is where to put it. I ask the Minister to show due acknowledgement of the Garda's work by providing the finance to carry out the necessary renovations of Clonmel Garda station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this important matter. The district headquarters at Clonmel was examined in 1994 and it was decided that the building is large enough to house all of the facilities necessary at this location. A maintenance programme was put in place and a number of maintenance issues have been addressed since then.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the canteen facility was relocated and upgraded and the entire building was externally painted. In 1996 the cell block was upgraded bringing it up to a proper standard and some additional external painting was undertaken. Electrical work was undertaken to upgrade the light fittings. In 1997 further electrical work was undertaken to replace light fittings and the inside of the building was painted. Last year more than £16,000 was spent on upgrading the fire alarm system and emergency lighting. In total, more than £50,000 has been spent in the past four years on maintenance issues.</P>
      <P>It is planned to convert the top floor to provide in-service training facilities. I understand the Garda housing officer has no requests in hand for specific maintenance work. He has, however, undertaken to visit the station in the week commencing 15 February when he will inspect the building and report on further issues that need to be addressed. The points raised by the Deputy will be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much work has been done in recent years in improving standards of accommodation at Garda stations. It is a largescale operation. The pro<Col N="627" /> gramme of improvements has a high priority with the Minister and the Government. Last year more than £7 million was expended on maintenance. A further £7 million was expended on capital projects. This year more than £10 million has been allocated between new building and maintenance works. There are 704 Garda stations as well as married quarters, large complexes such as Templemore and Garda headquarters and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied are old RIC and DMP stations designed for a different era.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Much work has been done in recent years to improve the situation. Members will be aware of examples of improvements to Garda stations and new stations built in recent years. When the Garda housing officer completes his report following his visit to Clonmel the issues identified will be addressed in line with overall priorities and the availability of finance.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 February 1999.</P>

    <P>The growth in freight traffic illustrated by Stena Lines throughput at these ports reflects the economic buoyancy of the economy generally.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, despite unprecedented economic growth over the last few years, the number of freight units travelling through Dun Laoghaire is only marginally higher than 1994-95 figures whereas Dublin Port Ro/Ro throughput has nearly trebled over the same period.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that representations have been made to me expressing concern in relation to traffic congestion and I have brought these concerns to the attention of the harbour company. I advise the Deputy, however, that Stena Line does not anticipate that the number of freight units using the harbour is likely to exceed the current market levels.</P>

      <P>The Corrib system or &ldquo;western lakes&rdquo; development project has been receiving funding under the tourism angling measure, TAM, of the Operation Programme for Tourism since early 1995 with the import objective of rehabilitating the Corrib, Mask and Cara Lakes as prime brown trout fisheries for domestic and tourism angling. The amount of funds allocated for each of the years of the project is: £1,035 million in 1995, £0,220 million in 1997 and £0,800 million in 1998. This brings the total investment in the western lakes project to over £2 million and is nearly 12 per cent of the total funding available over the whole period under the tourism angling measure. As with all such projects, contract staff are employed on a project specific basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the TAM is to develop the national angling product to best international standards and significantly increase the number of tourist anglers visiting the country. Angling has tremendous benefits from the tourism perspective <Col N="631" /> as a year round activity, often in non-traditional tourism locations, delivering significant local economic return as well as contributing to the tourism sector overall. The main flagship investments under this measure have been in the west.</P>
    <P>I am advised that an application for a further £4 million funding, based on the surveys of rivers and streams carried out on the Corrib, Mask and Cara has been submitted to the TAM unit in the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>The CFB advises that all available TAM funding under the tourism angling measure 1994-1999 has been committed at this stage. The extent to which the western lakes project and other additional applications might receive funding depends on the level of any funding decommitted before end 1999.</P>

      <P>Definitive statistics for landings in 1998 are being finalised. They indicate that total landings by the south west whitefish fleet of whitefish, nephrops and tuna into the main fishing ports in the region were over 18,000 tonnes valued at £23.9 million.</P>
      <P>A comparison of these 1998 landings with recent years shows a progressive increase in the annual value of these landings by the south west whitefish fleet over the period 1995-1998. The volume of total landings is showing the same trend. I am advised that the take-up of key whitefish quota species in the south west, including monkfish, hake and sole, was close to 100 per cent of quota catches. Other quota species such as whiting and plaice were not fully utilised while the landings statistics also underline the important economic contribution which the tuna fishery makes to the south west whitefish fleet where catches in 1998 were worth over £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More detailed comparative analysis of all landings data and underlying factors and trends in 1998 and previous years is needed and at my <Col N="633" /> request a joint working group of the fishing industry and the Department under the auspices of the sea fisheries liaison group is undertaking this analysis.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant EU Regulations, the monitoring inspection and control of fishing activity is first and foremost the responsibility of the member states. The Commission is responsible for ensuring and verifying that member states carry out those legal obligations in an equitable and effective manner. The Commission carries out verifications of member states' controls through on-the-spot inspections and cross-checking of databases on vessels, catches and landings. The Commission can also request member states to provide information on specific matters relating to fishing activity of its vessels or other aspects of the control regulation.</P>
      <P>The Commission undertakes a number of inspections each year of Irish fisheries monitoring and control in Irish ports and at sea. Ireland has also complied with requests by the Commission for information on mackerel and horsemackerel catches, landings and exports which were also addressed to a number of other member states. The Commission is currently in correspondence with Ireland and other member states with queries about the possible overfishing by fishing vessels in 1995 and 1996 on several quota species, where there are technical differences between quota utilisation figures adduced by the Commission and those of member states.</P>
      <P>My Department co-operates with the Commission in supplying data on request and facilitating inspections and the Commission itself acknowledges this. I fully expect other member states to be equally co-operative with the Commission to ensure a level playing field across the EU in fisheries control.</P>

      <P>Licensing decisions are governed in particular by section 61 of the 1997 Act, which specifies key factors to be taken into account in the decision making process including existing and potential alternative beneficial uses of the areas concerned, the likely ecological and environmental effects of the aquaculture project, the likely impact of the aquaculture operation on the economy of the area in question and the effect or potential effect on the heritage value of the area.</P>
      <P>The licensing framework now in place for aquaculture therefore is firmly geared to ensuring that all such development takes place on a sustainable basis and is compatible with other interests and local economic activity including tourism.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 26, 47 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium identifies as a key priority &ldquo;transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities&rdquo; in the context of securing and enhancing the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on the sea for their future. Partnership 2000 commits to &ldquo;review the strategic options for the future development and management of declining commercial regional ports&rdquo;. The strategy statement 1998-2000 of the Department commits as a key objective &ldquo;to facilitate the restructuring of the roles of sub-regional ports&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Within these contexts consultants have been contracted to undertake a review of State regional ports and harbours with a cargo throughput of less than 250,000 tonnes to develop a general strategic framework for these ports and harbours, having regard to their differing conditions and potential, and to recommend generic and port/harbour related models and options which will best deliver the objectives of the strategic framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of these 16 State regional ports around the country includes Baltimore, Arklow and Wicklow harbours. The regional ports and harbours covered by the study currently operate <Col N="639" /> under the structures of the 1946 Harbours Act and range from those with busy commercial traffic to others catering for a mix of uses including seafishing and marine leisure as well as some which have experienced a severe decline in terms of commercial and seaborne trade. The intention is to chart the way forward for these ports and set out a long-term, coherent and sustainable development plan for their future and for the people whose livelihoods they support as well as identifying the best development options, including local authority control in terms of ownership, financing and activities/operations.</P>
    <P>Consideration of any development proposals and options for future ownership and management, use of assets and activities and operations of the regional harbours will follow the outcome of the consultants review, which is expected to be completed in a matter of months. An extensive consultation process has been undertaken as part of the review to incorporate the views of all interested parties prior to determination of the nature of restructuring of the ports concerned.</P>
    <P>I have also instigated a review of the operation of the 1996 Harbours Act, in conjunction with the Irish Ports Association and the port companies. The intention is to establish whether the legal framework under which the major State ports operate, is constraining in any way their ability to deliver on their commercial mandate both now and in the future. The review will also address the rapidly changing international picture of ports development and modernisation to establish if lessons can be learned from the experience of others. We need to be satisfied that port managements at the nine commercial State port companies are not being organisationally constrained by the present legal framework and also that private sector involvement and investment is not discouraged by it.</P>
    <P>The management framework for ports must be conducive to the most cost effective use of port facilities. It must look to complete openness in provision of port services and define new partnerships between public and private sectors in investment financing and assets management. Ideally we need to take a fresh look at what the respective roles of the public and private sectors should be post-millennium. The ports industry has a catalytic role to play in maintaining the competitiveness of our external trade and in improving links between transport modes and must be best positioned to do so.</P>
    <P>In relation to ports ownership including the privatisation issue raised, I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the review of State regional ports under the Harbour Act, 1946, and the review of the operation of the Harbours Act, 1996, under which the commercial State port companies function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was corporatised on 3 March 1997 Dublin Port Company has been statutorily responsible under the Harbours Act, 1996, for the management, control direction and development of the harbour as a commercial State company. Freeing up the port from direct State control gave it the commercial freedom needed to operate as a modern, customer oriented service industry, while enhancing accountability for operational and financial performance. Co-financing of infrastructural development at Dublin Port comes through my Department, from the EU via the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999, the Ireland &ndash; Wales Maritime INTERREG Community initiative and the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To determine the needs of the ports industry, including Dublin Port, my Department com<Col N="641" /> missioned independent consultants last year to complete an EU national seaport capacity study. As part of this study a comprehensive physical investory of existing seaport capacity, including that of Dublin Port, was completed. The expert consultants have determined the future demand for seaport traffic handling capacity by mode and consequent infrastructural and organisational improvements which will be required to cater for future traffic. The study is a significant tool in ensuring the development and maintenance of adequate infrastructural capacity at strategic Irish ports to cope with economic growth and to underpin future development plans to deliver that capacity and his identified requirements up to 2007.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port is a multimodal port catering for all cargo modes, as well as passengers. In terms of capacity the throughput in 1998 amounted to some 18.6 million tonnes &ndash; a record year which demonstrates the capacity of the port company to handle increased traffic.</P>
    <P>Based on the examination of the port industries' importance to the economy and of its development needs over the period to 2007, I am advised that a substantial investment programme for ports is required. This programme will comprise a number of complementary measures which will seek to maximise the use of existing facilities and infrastructure, and ensure sufficient new infrastructure is added as demand grows. Dublin Port has identified its requirements and this is being considered for co-financing in the context of whether there will be available funds under the next national development plan and the capacity of the port and possibly port users to fund such new infrastructure as well as the cost of existing facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concerns of Deputies about fishermen whose fishing activities have been seriously hampered in recent weeks. I heard at first hand the real hardship which some fishermen were enduring during a two day series of meetings with fishermen's representatives from around the country. I was particularly concerned about those fishermen who operate out of smaller inshore boats, dependent on catches of white fish for their regular income. These are the most vulnerable people in the fishing communities as they are most affected by weather conditions. My priority was to devise a structured response that <Col N="644" /> will protect the livelihoods of fishermen during periods when they are unable to fish and have low incomes. The Deputy will be aware that EU state aid rules for the fishing industry rule out aid packages for income loss due to periods of bad weather.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to meeting fishermen's organisations I met with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Following detailed discussions with the Minister, the agreement of Government was secured to the introduction of a new scheme to be known as fishing assist which will benefit low income self-employed fishermen. The legislative basis for the scheme is provided in the Social Welfare Bill, which was published last week.</P>
      <P>The new scheme includes changes to the income support arrangements for fishermen as follows: 80 per cent of all income from self-employment will be assessed, rather than 100 per cent as has been the case heretofore; child related income disregards of £100 per annum for the first two qualified children and £200 per annum for the third and subsequent children; and relaxation of signing on arrangements.</P>
      <P>It is expected that over 500 low income self-employed fishermen will benefit from the fishing assist measure which will cost up to £1 million in a full year. This scheme provides a structured response to a long-term problem and tackles the situation of low income fishermen in the whitefish and inshore fleets who are particularly vulnerable to prolonged periods of bad weather which interfere with fishing activities.</P>
      <P>Following a series of meetings with fishermen's representatives I have established a working group to assess the extent of serious short-term problems in the fishing industry. The group, comprising representatives of the fishermen, my Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara will report back to me shortly. In the meantime fishermen affected by bad weather will now receive support under the new fishing assist scheme which the Government has approved.</P>

      <P>From the outset the Scottish Office has been supplying information on the outbreak and it has also assured my Department that EU legislation on the placing on the market of farmed fish in the event of an outbreak of this kind was being enforced and that every effort was being made to prevent the disease spreading to non-affected areas. Officials of the Department, BIM and the Irish industry met with representatives of the Scottish Office in autumn 1998 to examine at first hand the details of the measures being undertaken to combat and prevent the spread of ISA.</P>
      <P>The IFA fish farming section has developed a code of practice in co-operation with BIM and the Department for the sector as well as for fishermen, vets and fish processors.

      <P>The production and placing on the market of shellfish is regulated in accordance with the European Communities (Live Bivalve Molluscs) (Health Conditions for Production and Placing on the Market) Regulations, 1996 (SI No. 147 of 1996) Inspections, checks and sampling are carried out by my Department and health boards in respect of a range of processing facilities, including shellfish production areas, processing plants, etc. The aim of this detailed programme of surveillance and control is to ensure that shellfish products placed on the market are in full conformity with the prescribed health criteria and do not pose a risk to human health.</P>
      <P>As an additional safeguard to public health the Marine Institute, with the co-operation of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and Irish shellfish producers, co-ordinates a national monitoring programme for the detection of toxins in shellfish. Samples are tested on a weekly basis throughout the year, and the harvesting of shellfish is prohibited if toxins are detected at an unsafe level. The ban on harvesting is lifted after thorough analysis of samples shows that the shellfish are fit for human consumption. The level of monitoring has recently been intensified and an enhanced level of testing for diarrhetic shellfish poison, DSP, toxins has been introduced.</P>
      <P>Notifications have been received concerning alleged problems arising from the consumption of Irish mussels from the French authorities. This notification arose from two limited outbreaks of illness in France last September in which the symptoms were reported as being consistent with those caused by DSP.</P>
      <P>My Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute is following up on these alleged incidents with the French authorities and the EU Commission to establish conclusively the association, if any, of Irish mussels with these food poisoning outbreaks.</P>
      <P>As a precautionary measure, and pending completion of the current analysis and crosschecks frozen Irish mussels produced in the summer of 1998 were temporarily withdrawn from the market. This is standard operating procedure of all shellfish processors in line with product quality and consumer health standards.</P>
      <P>Irish mussel exports to France and other markets in live and processed form are unaffected.</P>

      <P>The EIS was available for public consultation for a period of one month from 30 June 1998.

      <P>The position in relation to the Corrib Field is that Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum and Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited drilled an appraisal well last year and produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The licensees are not able to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage and they will not be able to do so until they have fully evaluated the accumulation. The evaluation process will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years and is expected to include the drilling of additional appraisal wells and Enterprise Oil have indicated that they are planning to drill a further appraisal well in Comb this year.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of Irish workers and goods and services in offshore exploration activities, it is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from such activities within the constraints of EU legislation. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy indicates that employees in one company were made redundant and became, on the following day, employees of the new owners. I understand that the Deputy wishes to ascertain if the interests of the workers in relation to pension entitlements were adversely affected as a result of their having been made redundant prior to the transfer of the business.</P>
      <P>I assume that the pension scheme referred to by the Deputy was a private scheme. Where there is a transfer pursuant to the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, 1980, the rights and obligations arising from the employment contract are transferred to the new employer. However, there is no obligation to ensure continuity of the pension scheme in a change of ownership situation, although the interests of the employees under the previous pension must be protected. It is a matter for the new owners to ensure that these interests were, in fact, protected.</P>

      <P>The possible loss of 100 jobs is a serious setback for Charlestown and for the surrounding region of north Mayo. I sympathise with the employees who are facing the threat of redundancy.</P>
      <P>Although I have not received any communication from the Charlestown Development Association, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to liaise with all appropriate development bodies at local level in response to this setback. I understand that a receiver has been appointed to the All-Fresh Bakery and is having ongoing discussions with a number of parties. Enterprise Ireland is already providing advice to those interested in trying to get the plant back into operation as a going concern. I consider that the most appropriate course of action is for the industrial developments agencies to continue to work in harmony with the local community.</P>
      <P>It was in recognition of the special needs of this region that I established the north Mayo enterprise initiative in June 1997, in the wake of the closure of the Asahi plant in Ballina. That initiative continues to have a significant beneficial influence on employment prospects in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> However, with regard to Betatherm Ireland Limited, the company closed its plant in Ballinrobe, County Mayo with the loss of 37 jobs in November 1998. I decided that an inter-agency task force should be established under the chairmanship of Mr. Des Mahon, county manager, Mayo County Council, to formulate an adequate response to the closure. The task force had its first meeting on 18 January 1999 in Castlebar and identified a range of priority actions. FÁS and the Local Employment Service will undertake a skills assessment of the 37 workers involved. This will also ascertain how many of them have obtained alternative employment. Efforts will also be made in conjunction with local employers to see if any employment activity can be generated at community level.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is actively marketing the former Betatherm plant in Ballinrobe. I am satisfied with the progress being made by the inter-agency task force.</P>

      <P>While neither my Department or its agencies has funds available for private counselling, FAS provides a guidance and counselling service. in relation to career/vocational choice for job seekers. This involves an assessment of aptitudes, abilities and experience primarily in relation to employment. Candidates might subsequently be referred to FAS training and/or employment programmes. In certain circumstances, the placement officer will maintain contact with the job seeker both through the career path activity and subsequent employment.</P>
      <P>The Local Employment Services, LES, which is currently located in 18 areas, provides more in-depth guidance and counselling for job seekers who are experiencing severe difficulty in accessing labour market opportunities, that is, long-term unemployed people. This is provided on a small case load basis, and allows for much more intensive interaction, including follow-up, with job seekers.</P>
      <P>These counselling facilities in FAS and LES are primarily aimed at people who are unemployed and ready for and seeking work. Where it is considered that the job seeker has other, non-work-career related problems, he/she would be referred to an appropriate agency, for example, the health board as neither FAS nor LES has the expertise to deal with such issues. In general, companies assist their own employees to access training or other necessary services where they are related to their own employment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Government has also established, under the aegis of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, 13 drug task force areas, 12 in Dublin and one in Cork.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall goal of my Department's policy for the shipping sector is to support and facilitate the development of a competitive Irish flagged and owned shipping sector, while maximising employment of Irish seafarers and ancillary shorebased personnel.</P>
      <P>The key objectives I am seeking to achieve are: to increase market share for Irish shipping services; to increase demand for, and supply of, well trained Irish seafarers; and to maintain and increase the Irish pool of maritime expertise because of its spin off benefits for the marine sector generally. The strategies I am employing include: the application of a competitive fiscal regime for the Irish shipping sector and seafarers, support for the training of seafarers, and ongoing review, in close consultation with the shipping sector, of the development/employment potential of the sector, taking account of the report of the task force on seafarer training and employment which I set up last year.</P>
      <P>On foot of the task force's report I secured the agreement in principle of the Government for a new national maritime college, which was the key recommendation of the task force. Arrangements are in hand to establish a high level interdepartmental working group which will be charged with examining the costings, financing and timing of the establishment of the new college with a view to submission of a fully developed proposal for implementation to Government at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also secured a special £200,000 allocation in my Department's Vote for 1999 to advance work on the costings and scheduling for the new college. This special allocation will kick start the project by supporting the interdepartmental group in its work. I will also launch a major new promotional campaign shortly to encourage young people to take up careers at sea, as recommended by the task force. This special £150,000 <Col N="657" /> three year programme, co-financed by the shipping industry and involving their active participation, will generate interest in careers at sea among our young people.</P>
    <P>A range of other measures have been introduced in support of the shipping sector. Following representations which I made to the Minister for Finance, a new £5,000 seafarers income tax allowance was introduced in the Finance Act in 1998. I am hopeful that this allowance, in conjunction with the existing corporation tax and PRSI concessions enjoyed by the sector, will help the Irish shipping industry expand both the fleet and Irish seafarer employment. The question of strengthening existing fiscal alleviation measures for the industry is the subject of ongoing review having regard to what is permissible under the EU Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport.</P>
    <P>The specific sectoral statistics sought by the Deputy are not available from the Central Statistics Office. Departmental officials have been considering ways in which such information can be collated, on an ongoing basis, to underpin future policy development of the shipping sector.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that a consultancy review has been commissioned to examine the feasibility of developing the marine services area and increasing the size of the fleet. My Department is working closely with the consultants and the shipping industry in this study task, which I am advised is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>While no court proceedings have yet been taken under the 1997 Act, consideration is being given by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, to initiating court proceedings in cases of serious interference with public navigation or other rights or with licensed aquaculturalists where no other remedy will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the regularisation of aquaculture operations in areas where operators proceeded without licences or ignored licence conditions, because of delays in updating the licensing legislation, is proceeding with on site <Col N="658" /> visits and surveys and dialogue with operators and the processing of long standing licence applications. Enforcement via court proceedings under the 1997 Act will be resorted to where warranted.</P>
    <P>An important new legal provision which I have introduced against illegal aquaculture is section 4 of the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Act, 1998, which prohibits any person making an application for an aquaculture licence on or after 10 December 1998 from commencing aquaculture operations until duly licensed. A breach of that prohibition will cause the application to fail.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 62 and 63 together and will deal separately with oil and gas and with other minerals since different legislative provisions apply to them.</P>
      <P>As regards offshore petroleum exploration, there were important developments last year in relation to two hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field. Three other earlier discoveries of some significance were the Connemara oil field, the Seven Heads oil and gas accumulation and the south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gasfield.</P>
      <P>In the case of Corrib, located off the Mayo coast, in 1998 Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum and Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited, drilled and tested an appraisal well, flaring gas on test at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage, this will only be possible when the accumulation has been fully evaluated. The evaluation process will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years and is expected to include the drilling of additional appraisal wells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May last year a ten year petroleum lease was granted to Providence Resources Plc over <Col N="659" /> the Helvick oil field off the Waterford coast. Published figures indicate that it contains an estimated seven million barrels of recoverable oil together with associated gas. Under the terms of the petroleum lease, the company is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field for my approval by 1 May 2000.</P>
    <P>The Connemara oil field with an estimated 200 million barrels of oil in place was appraised in 1997 by Statoil, but the results were such that they concluded that they could not declare the field commercial.</P>
    <P>The Seven Heads oil and gas accumulation, estimated to have at least 50 million barrels of oil and 100 billion cubic feet of gas in place, was offered to the industry last year under a lease undertaking round but no applications were received by my Department.</P>
    <P>The south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field, estimated to contain some 50 billion cubic feet of gas in place, is not being drained by the existing production facilities. Marathon, the operator, is currently considering the possibility of a programme of development to bring this into production.</P>
    <P>I would add that the Government is committed to continuing to promote and encourage, to the fullest extent, hydrocarbon exploration in Irish waters so as to enhance the prospects of further commercial discoveries.</P>
    <P>Prospecting or exploration for minerals or ores may only take place under and in compliance with a prospecting licence (PL) issued by me under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995. The information gathered from previous exploration under PLs is made available by me to holders and potential holders of PLs through the Geological Survey of Ireland which also provides bedrock and other specialist maps. Whether a find is judged commercial is a commercial decision by the explorationist who manifests that decision to me by applying for a state mining facility (SMF) under the Acts. I have forwarded to the Deputy a table showing which minerals are being produced and where significant deposits have been found.</P>
    <P>For more than 35 years Ireland has been recognised as a major zinc-lead country, with considerable potential for new discoveries in the limestone areas of central Ireland. There have been many discoveries, and Ireland is ranked in the top two countries in the world in terms of zinc and lead discovered per square kilometre. Some 80-90 per cent of current exploration expenditure in Ireland is focused on zinc and lead.</P>
    <P>Ireland also has significant potential for economic gold deposits in the older rocks that border the central limestones e.g. in counties Longford, Mayo and Wexford. A number of deposits are known, and exploration is continuing.</P>

      <Quest>the role which can be adopted in conjunction with other neutral States to ensure the solution of the conflict in Kosovo does not simply reflect the interests of the most powerful States.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3949/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 66, 67 and 68, inclusive.</P>
      <P>I remain extremely concerned at the situation in Kosovo. The increasing pattern of breaches of the ceasefire over recent weeks, compounded by the terrible atrocities which outraged the world, again underlines the importance and urgency of finding a political solution and bringing the suffering of all of the people of Kosovo to an end.</P>
      <P>I have made known in the House and elsewhere my outrage at Serbian atrocities and, together with my EU colleagues, I continue to insist that, in compliance with Security Council resolutions, the authorities in Belgrade allow the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal to carry out investigations, and that those responsible be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that international efforts to find a solution to the Kosovo problem are centred on the talks currently taking place in Rambouillet, outside Paris. The urgency of these talks is made clear against the very real threat of a resumption of large-scale violence, which otherwise could take place in a few weeks time, with the end of winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process now under way has been welcomed and received the support of the United <Col N="662" /> Nations Security Council, and of the EU. I should mention that the EU's Special Envoy to Kosovo, the Austrian Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch, is playing a central role in this process, with the full support of the Union.</P>
    <P>If the current efforts to bring about peace are to succeed, then it is essential that they should enjoy the widest possible support from the international community as a whole. I would envisage that in Kosovo, as previously in Bosnia, a number of international bodies will need to be involved in a mutually reinforcing way. I attach particular importance to the continued involvement of the United Nations Security Council, and also of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and of the EU.</P>
    <P>This broader-based support, with accompanying concrete actions, is spelt out in resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, in decisions of the OSCE including to establish the Kosovo Verification Mission, and in decisions and conclusions of the EU's General Affairs Council. Such an approach is not based on the interests of the most powerful states but makes possible the involvement of a very wide range of countries of all sizes, including the European neutrals. Irelands' views have been, and will continue to be, put forward very actively in all those fora in which we are members.</P>
    <P>Another way in which we can continue to make a contribution is, as the Deputy suggests, the provision of Irish personnel with experience in conflict prevention and peacekeeping. Irish personnel &ndash;  be they military, police or civilian &ndash; who are engaged throughout the entire region with various missions of the United Nations, the OSCE, the EU or others, repeatedly demonstrate a particular sensitivity to the local situations and a capacity to deal with them. This is also acknowledged and appreciated by all concerned, and I intend to see that this pattern of contribution is maintained.</P>
    <P>As regards experience with Northern Ireland, I would be somewhat cautious about drawing too close parallels with any situation in the Balkans, which constitute an extraordinarily complex region, consisting of a large number of smaller areas with divergent histories and characteristics.</P>

      <P>Under the 1998 ewe premium scheme the person named applied for payment in respect of 50 ewes. The Department inspector called to the farm to carry out an inspection of the flock on 21 April 1998 but due to the non co-operation of the person named he was unable to do so. Two Department officers called again eight days later to carry out the inspection but on this occasion the person named said that he had sold the sheep. The sale of the sheep was not recorded in the sheep register which is a requirement under the scheme. On 23 July 1998 the person named was asked to submit acceptable documentation regarding the sale (copy of cheque, bank statement) to the local office in Cork to verify that the sheep on which he claimed were maintained on the farm throughout the retention period (i.e. 10 January 1998 to 19 April 1998) to enable his application to be fully processed. To date this documentation has not been submitted by the person named.</P>

      <P>When the applicant first applied to join REPS in November 1997 grazing rights of the nature held by him were not eligible for inclusion.</P>
      <P>On 10 November 1998 my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands announced interim arrangements for the implementation of commonage framework plans in order to facilitate the early acceptance of applicants into REPS in NHAs and commonages, including grazing rights.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, I announced details for the implementation of the new package of measures for NHAs-commonages-grazing rights. This required the revision of the scheme terms and conditions and the accompanying specifications.

      <P>The facade of the National Museum of Ireland building in Kildare Street had seriously deteriorated within 30 years of its construction date which is given as between 1885 and 1891. The stone used was face-bedded rather than end-<Col N="667" /> bedded and the masons involved used the softer rather than the harder face as a front.</P>
      <P>The building maintenance service of the Office of Public Works, which has the expertise available to undertake specialist projects on prestigious buildings, undertook the complete restoration of the exterior stonework of the National Museum building. The project, which commenced in 1995, is the largest of its kind in Europe. The work involves not merely the cleaning, but the reconstruction of large areas of the carved stone mouldings and details, which have been corroded by pollution over the years.</P>
      <P>The stone facework is cut back or keyed, using a grinder, hammer and bolster. Then layer after layer of specially formulated mortar is built up before being moulded into the desired shape. For larger pieces, templates are made up on site and transferred to be made into moulds which are then cast off-site.</P>
      <P>The cleaning of the facade involves the use of sandstone cleaner chemical 100 which is used for the removal of dirt and grime from sandstone, unpolished granite, brick and terracotta. It will remove iron stains from masonry and contains agents to prevent iron stain formation on the stone face. Calcium carbonate which contains fine carboniferous limestone granules is also used. The product is crushed and screened several times, then air classified to produce a material of high purity with a controlled level of fines. It is dried to give a very low moisture content. The cleaning of the facade also involves the use of oligomer siloxane solution with additives for water repelling impregnation of cementitious building materials. This product was especially developed as a water repelling treatment for natural stone.</P>
      <P>The cleaning products and the cleaning method conforms to BS 6270. In effect, the whole facade of the National Museum building is being restored or cast anew under this ambitious project. These works are due to be completed in 2001 at which stage, a similar project for the National Library building will be undertaken.</P>

    <P>The Commissioners have also informed me that the best indicator of the number of persons currently benefiting from the scheme is the number claiming, on an on-going basis, the relief from excise duty on fuel. That figure is 5,400.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The cost of the scheme has risen from approximately £4 million in 1994 to £11.8 million in 1997 and £14.4 million in 1998. These amounts do not include the cost of road tax which is remitted by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>For a considerable period of time beneficiaries have been allowed claim repayment of VRT-VAT on a car every two years. This provision was put in place originally on the basis of a case made by organisations representing the disabled who maintained that, because disabled persons may have a higher than average car usage and are particularly reliant on their cars for transport, they require newer, more reliable cars than may generally be the case. Once the two year retention period has expired, the car in question may be disposed of by the beneficiary on the open market without any tax liability arising. Residual tax is not repayable when a vehicle is disposed following the two year period.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's proposal concerning a possible extension of the scheme &ndash; to be paid for by increasing the two year period for retention of the car &ndash; will be taken into consideration when the scheme is next reviewed. I should point out, however, that organisations representing the disabled are likely to be opposed to any extension of the period during which a beneficiary under the scheme must retain the car.</P>

It is a condition of the approval granted to Repak Limited under article 15 of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, that the company submits an annual report not later than 31 March of each year in relation to its activities in the preceding calender year. Repak Limited commenced operations in July 1997. The company reported that in the period to 31 December 1997, member companies nationally arranged for the recovery of 30,000 tonnes of packaging waste arising on their own premises, and Kerbside Recycling Dublin and Rehab Recycling Partnership, which receive significant funding from Repak Limited, diverted some 21,000 tonnes of packaging waste from the domestic waste stream for recovery. I await the company's annual report for 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department's priorities for future investment in water supplies to serve the Dublin region is guided by the strategy set out in the greater Dublin water supply strategic study. This study has made a series of <Col N="672" /> recommendations aimed at ensuring that the demand for water will be met and that satisfactory levels of service and standards will be complied with over the next 20 years. A copy of the study is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A major investment programme has been put in place to ensure that the needs of the expanding Dublin area can be met. The programme consists of the expansion of the Leixlip water treatment works, a major water conservation programme and a number of other projects to upgrade and refurbish treatment works, reservoirs and the distribution system. The Dublin schemes represent an investment in excess of £110 million and include the following projects from the 1999 water and sewerage investment programme: Bohernabreena spillways &ndash; to advance through planning;Dublin water conservation &ndash; under construction; Leixlip water treatment plant &ndash; under construction; Lucan water &ndash; to advance through planning; reservoir works at Stillorgan, Vartry and Ballyboden &ndash; to advance through planning; and Roundwood wavewall &ndash; to start construction. In addition, under the serviced land initiative, schemes submitted by the Dublin local authorities, costing £11.5 million, have been approved to extend water supplies to development land for new housing.</P>

Construction is expected to commence in late 2000.</P>
      <P>In view of the urgency attached to this scheme, my Department is participating with the local authorities concerned in a special steering group to expedite planning and construction.

      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements in the South Eastern Health Board region has increased substantially over the last five years.

Expenditure on mortgage interest supplements fell in 1998, compared to 1997, reflecting more favourable economic conditions, especially lower interest rates and lower unemployment.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to correct the situation whereby part-time workers cannot get social welfare benefit for periods when they are out of work in spite of the fact they are available for work and seeking similar part-time work, particularly for periods when work is not available to them.</Quest>

      <P>The statutory conditions governing the award of unemployment benefit or <Col N="674" /> unemployment assistance payments require that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking suitable work.</P>
      <P>In so far as part-time workers are concerned, they must therefore be available for and seeking work for the periods in which they are not employed in order to qualify for a payment. For instance, a part-time worker who works three days per week must be making efforts to find work for the other days of the week, or full-time employment elsewhere. Unemployed persons are required to provide information regarding their availability for and their efforts to secure full-time employment.</P>
      <P>A claim for an unemployment payment will not be approved if the deciding officer is not satisfied that the claimant is available for and making reasonable efforts to find suitable employment. In making this determination the deciding officer will have regard to, among other things, the availability of employment or other suitable opportunities in the area. A deciding officer may revise his decision if the claimant subsequently demonstrates that he or she satisfies the statutory conditions for receipt of an unemployment payment. Furthermore, if a claimant is not satisfied with a deciding officer's decision regarding availability and efforts to find work, he or she may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as to certain people with disabilities and people receiving the carer's allowance under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes, free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free TV licence, are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. In addition, widows-widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for these free schemes is that the applicant must be living alone or living only with certain excepted people. Persons who are disabled may qualify as excepted people. However, people in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance do not qualify as excepted people for the purpose of the free schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes commencing, in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>To be entitled to unemployment benefit a person must, in addition to satisfying the contribution conditions, be capable of available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment. A person who does not, in the opinion of a deciding officer, meet these conditions is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In addition, a person may be disqualified from receiving payment for a period of up to nine weeks if he or she is deemed to have left their employment voluntarily and without just cause.</P>
      <P>The person in question made a claim for unemployment benefit on 12 September 1997. Following consideration of her case a deciding officer imposed a disqualification for a period of nine weeks from 12 September 1997, to 12 November 1997, on the grounds that she had left her employment voluntarily and without just cause.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer also disallowed her claim on the grounds that she was not available for or genuinely seeking employment. Following further consideration of her case the deciding officer allowed the claim from 13 November 1997. Payment was made to her up until 29 November 1997 when she ceased to sign the unemployed register. As she is in receipt of a one parent family payment, she was entitled to a payment of £33.80 a week, half the weekly personal rate of unemployment benefit otherwise payable in her case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She appealed against the decision in relation to the nine week period of disqualification and an oral hearing of her case was held on 18 February 1998. An appeals officer, on the basis of the facts before him and the evidence presented to him, reduced the period of disqualification to six <Col N="676" /> weeks and allowed her claim from 24 October 1997 to 12 November 1997.</P>
    <P>Arrears due for the period 24 October 1997 to 12 November 1997 were offset against payments of supplementary welfare allowance made to the person concerned pending a decision on her claim.</P>
    <P>An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    <P>The number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit in 1998 averaged 68,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>During that year some 800 persons in receipt of unemployment benefit were formally disallowed on the ground of not genuinely seeking work and some 1,800 on the ground of not being available for work. These figures do not include persons who cease signing of their own accord following interview or other review of their claim, the number of whom would be significant.</P>

The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need an additional financial incentive to return to the workforce. It is, therefore, a requirement of the scheme that an applicant must apply prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 30 March 1998. He applied for the allowance on 18 January 1999. Under the rules of the scheme his application was refused as the claim was late and he had already returned to work.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, defines a refugee as a person who &ldquo;owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it&rdquo;. Each application is considered on its own merits and where the above definition is met the person is granted refugee status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> In accordance with our international obligations in the asylum area, people entitled under international law to protection are given protection. All applications are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
    <P>There are occasions where the criteria for the granting of refugee status are not met but good reasons exist where the person in question should not be returned to his or her country of origin at the particular point in time. In such an instance, consideration is given to allowing the person temporary permission to remain in the State. I will continue to exercise my discretion in such circumstances in keeping with our international reputation and humanitarian traditions in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department, and to Bus Éireann which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. I am pleased to confirm that Bus Éireann, with the support of my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, Minister of State, this week launched a high profile safety campaign aimed at pupils who travel by bus to school each day, and at other road users. This followed my recent announcement in relation to escorts and safety harnesses for children with disabilities who travel on school buses. An amount of £3.4 million has been committed to improve these services over two years, starting this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the carrying capacity of school buses, I should explain that this is regulated by Department of Environment and Local Government legislation. Under these regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils to every two adult seats, without an upper age limit. The position is, therefore, that a 52 adult seater bus can carry 78 pupils. Great care is taken to ensure that loadings do not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity.</P>
      <P>The vehicles used in the school transport scheme meet all statutory regulations as required by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of the Environment and Local Government tests in regard to roadworthiness. Bus Éireann's policy of continuous fleet replacement facilitates the improvement in the quality of vehicles used for school transport, and provides a better standard of service for pupils availing of school transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing public and passenger transport are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The transport Bill referred to by the Deputy is in respect of freight, and is being brought before the Dáil by the Minister for Public Enterprise. However, there is a commitment by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, <Col N="683" /> in liaison with my Department, to develop a strategy for safety on school transport in the near future. My Department has requested Bus Éireann to consider the wide range of safety issues associated with the operation of the school transport scheme, and to assess the operational and financial implications of these proposals. My Department's response on the matter, when finalised, will be taken into consideration as part of a comprehensive review of road safety in general in the context of the Government's strategy for road safety.</P>

This condition may be waived by the local authorities in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness. Furthermore, candidates who hold a national certificate or diploma and are progressing to a degree course are eligible for grant assistance.

      <P>The position is that an application was received in my Department from a local group, An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, regarding the provision of an all Irish second level school in north east Dublin. The proposed location of the school was a site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin in Artane.</P>
      <P>An examination of the need for such facility was carried out by the planning section of my Department. The result indicated a significant level of demand arising from increased all-Irish provision at primary school level in this area in recent years. An assessment carried out by the technical staff of my Department revealed that, at 1.2 acres, the proposed site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin would be totally inadequate as a location for a permanent school building.</P>
      <P>I accept that some pupils in north east Dublin may experience inconvenience in terms of distance to an existing all-Irish second level school. My Department will continue to work with An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin VEC to develop an appropriate response at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The guidance and counselling services funded by my Department are confined to the support of students engaged in full-time study in schools and colleges, and as such generally excludes those in employment. In addition, a sum of £728,000 is being provided in 1999 for a joint guidance, counselling and psychological service for early school leavers in youthreach and traveller programmes and in FÁS funded community training workshops. The measure is implemented locally by the vocational education committees, FÁS and the training centres concerned. Young people with drug problems are included among the groups catered for on the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time options will be developed on these programmes during 1999. In addition, vocational education committees, schools and youth services are also involved in a range of specific projects with area based partnerships under the operational programme for local urban and rural <Col N="686" /> development. The initiatives involved may include counselling services. The programme is co-ordinated and administered by area development management limited and funded by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. A number of projects promoters in local drug task force areas are also in receipt of funding under the Governments £10 million drugs initiative in respect of drug education and prevention programmes.</P>

      <P>The minimum academic qualification for the position of special needs assistant in a special school is a grade D, or pass, in Irish, English and mathematics in the junior certificate or in an examination of equivalent standard. My Department will occasionally waive this requirement where the board of management of the school concerned requests such an exemption and can demonstrate that the candidate proposed for the post of special needs assistant in the school is the most suitable for the position even though he or she may not have the minimum academic qualifications.</P>
      <P>Candidates must be between 17 and 65 years of age on 1 September of the year in which they take up appointment. Candidates' health must be such that they are able to carry out the duties of a special needs assistant in a regular and efficient manner.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of each board of management, through the principal teacher to organise and participate in the effective supervision of pupils during breaks, lunch periods, assembly and dismissal. It is a matter for the authorities of each individual school to make any necessary arrangements to discharge this duty of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the organisation of the school transport system, buses are normally required to operate a number of runs. This provides a basic level of service while achieving optimum value from the buses in use. To facilitate the operation of these <Col N="687" /> services, children are often required to wait some time, morning and evening, for their service.</P>
    <P>Primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child should have more than one hour and 30 minutes travelling and waiting time each day. The service to Scoil Raifterí operates within this guideline. As the vehicle in question also serves another pri<Col N="688" /> mary school, the pupils attending Scoil Raifterí are collected at 8.17 a.m. and arrive at the school at 8.35 a.m. However, overall waiting time is kept to a minimum, as these pupils are collected immediately after school finishes in the afternoon and brought home without delay. Since the service is within my Departments guidelines therefore, it cannot be regarded as unacceptable in the overall context of the scheme.</P>
