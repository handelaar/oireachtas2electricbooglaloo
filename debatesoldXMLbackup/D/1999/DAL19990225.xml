      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of vital national importance, namely the refusal by EUROSTAT of the Government's application for Objective One status and the need for the Government in the light of this decision to publish the correspondence received from EUROSTAT and the application that was submitted to EUROSTAT and the need for the Government to immediately reapply for Objective One status for the west, midlands and Border regions with proper regional structures in place.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I said the ESB should be far more conscious of the structures it puts in place, particularly in urban areas. These are crude structures that need to be integrated into the landscape in some way. Many power lines throughout the country can be described as seriously injurious to the landscape. The most recent one stretched from Moneypoint through County Galway and across the midlands to the east coast. It is one example where there has not been any sensitivity to the landscape. It goes across amenity areas like the Slieve Aughty mountains and right through the midlands. The planners in the ESB should be more sensitive about the installations in urban areas. In addition, the jury is out on the safety and health risks associated with high voltage power lines, which are often placed next to residential areas or individual houses in rural areas. I hope the controversy in Cork is not repeated. The ESB seems insistent that pylons will be located in Cork harbour. The associated power lines will be very intrusive in the area's visual amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of competition into the generation of electricity should mean cheaper prices for the consumer. However, if demand continues to grow at the current rate of 6 per cent per annum, it is unlikely the consumer will get cheaper power. If the ESB is partially privatised, control will be lost. Governments will not be able to act as previous Governments have on many occasions in asking the ESB to hold back on price increases unless the Minister retains the power of pricing for the ESB. That would be a severe blow, <Col N="267" /> because if profit is the motive for those buying into the service, they will seek price increases. It is worth pointing out that as oil and coal prices have levelled off recently &ndash; and substantially reduced in some cases &ndash; the ESB has not passed on a subsequent reduction in price to the consumer. Great vigilance is needed to regulate price increases if privatisation is to take place.</P>
    <P>What is the situation regarding job losses, particularly with the electricity generating stations in the midlands which are coming to the end of their lifespans? What safeguards are there for the workers in those plants, who have given sterling service over the years to the ESB? I pay tribute to the ESB at all levels for the excellent service provided through the years often during unsocial hours and in dangerous conditions, particularly last Christmas when the west experienced severe storm conditions. Due to the efficient service provided by the ESB most areas were not without electricity for more than one or two hours. Will that level of commitment continue in the event that certain sections of the ESB are handed over to outside interests? If we are about to dismantle the present structure we must be careful about what will take its place.</P>
    <P>New electricity connections in rural areas are very expensive. When supply has to be provided to a new house, the ESB refurbishes existing transformers and replaces the old power line. The cost involved is passed on to the new customer, usually a young couple. In addition to the high price of a new house the young couple have this extra expense which cannot be financed through a housing loan and they are indebted twice over to some lending institution for the high cost passed on. While the ESB gives an undertaking to refund the original applicant some of the cost if further supply is needed in the immediate vicinity, that does not always happen at the appropriate time. I wonder whether the ESB would consider introducing a charge which could be included in the billing system to alleviate the hardship caused by the initial cost of connection.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned the potential for renewable resources. I have referred to wind farms in the rural landscape, which are obtrusive and a cause of concern to many isolated communities. Has the ESB investigated the potential for wave or tidal power along the coastline, which is extremely long relative to the size of the country? There must be some location where electricity could be produced from wave or tidal power. This source of energy would be renewable, economic and eliminate the concerns of many people regarding the continuous burning of fossil fuels. The burning of such fuels has been a source of concern to many people concerned with health issues, particularly those living in the vicinity of Moneypoint. I am aware from my contacts at Moneypoint that the ESB has spent enormous sums in upgrading its facilities for the treatment of emissions from the plant into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>An elderly friend in County Wicklow cannot <Col N="268" /> understand why a location such as Laragh, County Wicklow, is not investigated as a potential site for a hydroelectric power station. It is a natural valley which has many inbuilt and ready made characteristics suitable for the development of such a power station. That would be a valuable asset and would eliminate the need for the burning of fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>The public has legitimate fears that if the ESB is privatised certain areas will lose out. In the past CIE provided a rural bus service. When the more commercial aspects of the company were highlighted, slowly but surely it withdrew from the non-profitable routes, leaving many areas without a service. I fear a new operator will apply double standards, that urban customers will be prioritised while the rural isolated areas will be ignored. In the past, the ESB has treated all its customers equally. I would be seriously concerned if that practice were to change.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill. I welcome the fact that from February 2000, 28 per cent of the Irish market will be open to competition. This is the era of competition and liberalisation in the market. It is the first step along the road of change in the ESB. The uncertainty is beginning to be lifted and a way forward has been mapped out by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have referred to the rural electrification scheme. Hand in hand with rural electrification was the concept of group water schemes. Those two innovations were important for rural Ireland, leading to economic growth and a demand for increased power supplies. As a Deputy elected in the mid-1970s, I know it was difficult to complete rural electrification. Places like Ballycastle, County Mayo and the Black Valley in County Kerry were unable to get a supply because it was so expensive. Various Ministers and Governments and the ESB worked hard to ensure rural electrification extended to the whole country.</P>
      <P>Another welcome development was the introduction of a grant system to provide electricity to rural homes and for farming activities. That scheme was one of the best available and helped to keep farm families in rural areas. I am glad the ESB has continued to improve its service in rural Ireland, as there is even more need for electricity supplies.</P>
      <P>On the costs of the new regulations and commission, Mr. Ken O'Hara said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB starts off with a number of basic cost disadvantages. It has a range of public service obligations, most particularly the obligation to maintain peat fired and alternative energy stations. It also suffers from a number <Col N="269" /> of historical disadvantages, in so far as it has a range of older generation plant, much less efficient in many cases than the modern equivalent which a new supplier can start off with.</P>
    <P>I was glad Mr. O'Hara mentioned costs at peat fired stations because, as a rural Deputy, I am extremely interested in those stations. There are hundreds of acres of bog in the Galway-Roscommon area but turf cannot be cut from some of them because they are designated as special areas of conservation. The turf and milled peat harvested in those areas have been transported to various power stations and briquette plants in the midlands. Last year, 50,000 tonnes of milled peat were harvested in the Derryfadda bogs of Galway and Roscommon which I understand are to go to Lanesboro. In the past, milled peat from those bogs has been transported to Shannonbridge power station and Blackwater, County Offaly. Will milled peat from Derryfadda be brought to the new peat fired station which has been promised for the midlands? In many ways I hope the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, because I would like to see a peat fired station in Derryfadda, where a site is available, with a new road and lighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be an ideal location for a peat fired power station but if that does not happen the site is available for industry. That issue should be addressed by the Government.</P>
      <P> I pay tribute to the dedication of ESB workers at all levels. For the last two Christmases, when we experienced severe storms and flooding, the outdoor workers came off Christmas break to provide a service to people whose supply had been cut off. As a public representative I have been in touch with the ESB about these matters and have been told that transformers have broken down or are out of order, or cables have blown down. I am sure other Deputies have heard the same.</P>
      <P>This raises the question as to why we have so many overhead cables. In many towns and cities there are moves to install underground wires, a development which has been favourably received by the National Tidy Towns Committee. It may sound simplistic but we should move from overhead cables to a more modern system. In many towns which are installing sewerage systems or where Telecom Éireann is working, underground cabling is being installed at the same time. This is welcome because I do not advocate the wholesale digging up of roads in our towns. A lot of money is spent on roadworks and water and sewerage schemes. Surely underground cabling could be laid then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned renewable energy resources. Those involved in small hydro-powered or wind-powered schemes wish to know how to feed into the national grid, and they should be helped. There are difficulties with wind turbines in high amenity areas. Deputy Burke mentioned <Col N="270" /> that in south Galway, there was concern about the erection of 69 turbines in a rural community. The development was granted planning permission by the county council and upheld by An Bord Pleanála, but wind turbines should be located away from populated areas. Many people live in rural Ireland because of the peace and quiet. Noisy, unsightly wind turbines should not be near houses and centres of population.</P>
    <P>Wind turbines are about as popular as communications masts or superdumps, which leads me to the topic of incineration, part of the waste management strategy. Three places in east Galway are mentioned as possible landfill sites. As part of the process an incinerator will be provided near Galway city; it is argued that the incinerator should be near an industrial centre because the energy provided by waste incineration can be used in industry. Every county has a waste management strategy and the EU is considering regional strategies for waste disposal. Incineration is also part of the energy question and is promoted in every country in Europe but we lag considerably behind.</P>
    <P>There is also emphasis on recycling &ndash; some houses in Europe have three or four bins for separate disposal of bottles, cans, paper, etc. This exists on a small scale in parts of the country. In New Inn, County Galway, pig farms have a heating system which runs on methane gas from waste. This is not new, but we are looking at other issues which impinge on energy.</P>
    <P>Competition is most important. Mr. Aidan O'Regan, the head of regulatory affairs in the ESB, said that in many EU countries domestic consumers subsidise business users. The opposite is the case in Ireland. The challenge we face is ensuring that the cost of domestic electricity supplies remains low.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of energy provision throughout the island. There should be North-South co-operation in this area. This issue is particularly relevant now given that it arose when we discussed the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and her counterparts from the United Kingdom have had many discussions on this matter and I hope it will prove a practical way to bring people, North and South, together. We also face a challenge in respect of the cost of electricity supplies North and South.</P>
    <P>The ESB is one of our best run State companies. However, it would be the first to admit there are too many breakdowns in the service. I refer to the difficulties which occurred during last Christmas and the Christmas before when small dairy farmers, in particular, suffered a great deal. I am baffled that if a transformer breaks down the entire surrounding area can lose electricity supply. The ESB is aware this problem must be tackled. People who operate larger farms may have their own generators and can continue with their work during a blackout. However, that is not the case for small dairy farmers who are dependent on the ESB for their electricity supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> With regard to renewable energy, an issue to which Deputy Burke referred, we should carry out further research into the use of wave power. This country may not get adequate hours of sunshine to promote the use of solar energy and, as already stated, there have been difficulties in respect of wind farms, both from the point of view of planning and the construction of structures to withstand strong winds, but wave power is available on all our coasts. It may be difficult to harness this source of energy but its viability should be researched and developed.</P>
    <P> I have already complimented the staff of the ESB, particularly those who work outdoors. I also compliment the staff of ESB International. Three years ago I travelled to Tanzania with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and visited some of the projects on which ESB International had worked. I was amazed by what I saw. For example, ESB International was involved in many agricultural projects in Tanzania. It has been involved in projects in Croatia since 1995 and in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where it has five contracts, since 1996. The company has worked with a range of contractors from across the globe in the latter location. Many of its consultants have returned to Ireland and become involved in consultancy work. The company is widely known and its work, particularly in developing countries, is to be commended.</P>
    <P>In the past the ESB trained apprentices and I hope it will continue to do so. The education and training it is providing in Third World countries is second to none. I will conclude on that point to allow Deputy Michael Ahern to contribute. I welcome the Bill, I congratulate the Minister and I applaud the ESB for the work it is doing to facilitate the establishment of the new commission and the regulator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board has served the country well over the years and has brought light into the darkness. I praise the company's staff, with whom I have direct contact, who have given outstanding service to the country. This was evident during the past two winters when their selflessness and bravery was witnessed by all and sundry.</P>
      <P>During my time as a Member of this House, my dealings with the ESB have been friendly and fruitful. Its officials have always been receptive to representations in respect of problems experienced by customers. They always made every effort to solve those problems. However, times are changing for every sector in society and the ESB is no exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers that held sway in the ESB a number of years ago foresaw the onset of change and prepared the company for diversification. Deputy Michael Kitt referred to the work of ESB International but the company also saw that telecommunications and information technology would be important driving forces and influences in the years ahead. I understand the ESB invested more <Col N="272" /> than £200 million in establishing a system throughout the country to prepare it for the telecommunications boom. It was successful in doing so and found a suitable strategic partner to further its aims.</P>
    <P>One of the few complaints made to me in the past regarding the ESB relates to its attitude towards planning. People believed they were not treated fairly by the company when it decided to erect supply lines in certain locations, irrespective of the views of the general public.</P>
    <P>At present, a large problem is looming in my constituency in respect of the erection of approximately 49 pylons on the 11 to 12 mile stretch from the station at Aghada to Rafeen. The new line will run from Aghada to Saleen, across the island of Cobh and the River Lee, to Monkstown and on to Rafeen. The area is already well serviced by ESB lines &ndash; between six to eight of them already transverse the island of Cobh. The planning for this began six years ago but it only came to the notice of the general public and local landowners two years ago. Since then there has been a great deal of opposition to the plan. Many meetings have taken place between local representatives, Deputies and councillors, and a local group which is opposing the plan. The previous Government refused to meet the local opposition group. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is to be congratulated, however, because in her first week in office she travelled to east Cork and met the group. She met its representatives on a second occasion in Dublin and the Taoiseach also met them. On behalf of my constituents, I thank the Minister for the help she has given within the limits under which she operates. I also thank the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>An independent investigation was commissioned by Cork County Council, the findings of which supported the view that the cost of placing the line under land and water would be prohibitive. The ESB is willing to place it under water but would like the Government to pay for it. That would have a knock-on effect throughout the country. The ESB has sufficient funds; it spent between £200 million and £300 million on putting a telecommunications system in place. Was it allowed to do this under the relevant statute? Should it have used the money on the service it was established to provide? </P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide a regulatory framework for the introduction of competition in the generation and supply of electricity. I have heard on the grapevine that there are a number of bodies interested in providing an alternative generating station in the Rafeen area of Cork South-Central. This would remove the necessity to erect pylons from Aghada to Rafeen. I do not know the reason this project is not proceeding. Is it being blocked by forces which do not want competition? I understand the bodies concerned are reputable and have the necessary funding and expertise.</P>
    <P>Last week an attempt was made to erect the pylons, but the ESB was ejected from the site on <Col N="273" /> which it was working. I do not know the up-to-date position, but there is a considerable number of people &ndash; responsible, respectable and upstanding members of the community &ndash; who feel so strongly about the issue that they are willing to go to jail. There will be severe trouble in the area if the ESB proceeds. A solution acceptable to both sides has to be found. The solution might be to allow the bodies mentioned to proceed with the provision of an alternative generating station.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill which provides for the introduction of competition. There is a need for a regulatory framework to ensure no section of society is left in the dark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The ESB is the last monopoly in the State. This is now being broken in accordance with the terms of the EU directive. During the years it blackguarded young couples building their own homes. In 1973 when I was in a low-paid job I was asked for £900 to erect a transformer on a site I had purchased. I was informed that I would get some of this back within seven years if somebody else sought connection. I am still waiting. The ESB has not treated its customers with respect. It did and charged what it liked. Whenever a reduction was sought for young couples it gave the two fingers. It will now have to compete in the marketplace. The sooner competition is introduced the better. Industry has also been impeded in terms of the prices charged for electricity.</P>
      <P>On a positive note, I compliment the ESB on the work it did during the Christmas period to repair the damage caused by the severe storm in the west. The people of Erris suffered more than most, they were the first to lose power on Christmas Eve and the last to have it restored. This was followed by further cuts as a result of a less severe storm. I have as a consequence asked the ESB to place lines undergound. It cost it a small fortune to transport staff from other areas during the Christmas period. It has had to do this for three years in a row. It would be more cost effective to place lines underground on a phased basis. I know the Minister will do everything in her power to help.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of competition. I am aware of cases, the details of which I have sent to Deputy Currie, where the ESB asked young couples for between £6,000 and £8,000 to provide a service. Once the Minister announced the introduction of the Bill there was a new ruling and the charge was reduced to £700 or £800.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill because there must be competition in the marketplace, although I hope there will not be &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; following its introduction. I was in business for many years and saw how that operated, especially among the big players. I am glad it is coming out into the open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> The ESB was not a friend of rural people nor of young couples because it did not assist them in any way. I am not very popular with it because I have told it what I think of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The voters have to pay. It is terrible that a young couple who, after buying a site and building a house, get a bill and are then told the ESB can do nothing for them.</P>
      <P>It is wonderful what competition can do. The ESB will undergo many changes when it has to compete in the marketplace. Initial competition will be introduced in 2000 and more will follow in 2003. It is also welcome that prices will fall over a short period. Industries have been calling for this move because they have suffered at the hands of the ESB. Competition will make a difference.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister could examine the position in Erris. Is there a possibility that the board could put some of the infrastructure underground? I do not expect it all to be done in one year, but if a commitment were given it would make many people happy. The people of Erris have suffered, even in the summer time, because when there is a storm the ESB has to be called out. They have received a very poor supply of power over many years. Like myself, the Minister will pursue a matter if she takes it on. I know, therefore, that if she agrees to take up this matter with the ESB she will do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I also welcome competition in this area and the disappearance of another monopoly. The ESB, like others, will have to compete in the marketplace. It knows it can no longer charge what it likes. Those days are gone. The sooner the new structures are implemented the better.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Bill; it is long overdue. When I was first elected to the House the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, was attempting to regulate the ESB, especially with regard to its retail outlets where there is unfair competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>By all means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One positive aspect of the ESB is the way its crews have worked over the past couple of winters to restore power following bad weather in the south-west and north-west. They returned <Col N="275" /> supply to these areas often in terrible weather conditions.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the introduction of competition because the ESB has enjoyed a monopoly for far too long. My family and I are involved in the business of selling white goods and electrical supplies. The ESB has an unfair advantage here in the way it can utilise billing, etc. It is difficult for the private sector to compete on a fair playing pitch. Following deregulation in the coming years, the ESB will probably realise it is no longer in its interest to stay in that business because the private sector will give the same deals to consumers.</P>
    <P>Leitrim County Council provided demountable dwellings, to single men in particular, over the last number of years in relatively isolated areas. In one instance such a dwelling was provided 18 months ago, yet the occupier is still waiting for the ESB to supply electricity. It is horrendous that anybody should have to wait that length of time for an electricity service. It is the only service the occupier is entitled to. The council is prepared to pay for it, yet the ESB is unable to supply it. This is unbelievable and it should not happen.</P>
    <P>With the advent of competition I assume local authorities or private individuals will be able to approach competing providers and not have to wait as long for supplies. They currently have no choice. Young people who built homes and sought an electricity supply did not know what price they would be charged. It could have been anything from £2,000 to £6,000 depending, for example, on the number of poles to be erected. While the introduction of a uniform cost by the Minister is much fairer, the ESB must now live in the world of privatisation and competition. That can only be good for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment, however, the ESB has done excellent work on behalf of consumers and businesses in providing proper supplies. It has also improved in leaps and bounds over the last number of years. Nevertheless, as we approach the 21st century, it is imperative that the consumer has a choice. I, therefore, welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Over the last decade the privileged position of a number of monopoly service providers has come to an end. The consequences have generally been positive, especially for the consumer. I acknowledge the role of the Minister in ending the monopoly of Telecom Éireann, which has had startling and positive consequences for the consumer. The framework to be established by this legislation will have the same beneficial consequences for electricity consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential for further liberalisation of other service monopolies is extensive. For example, the monopoly enjoyed by Iarnród Éireann should be examined. It would enable the necessary capital to be provided to improve the railway line infrastructure. State ownership of railway lines, but <Col N="276" /> with a number of transport companies competing to operate them, combined with the privatisation of Iarnród Éireann could generate the substantial capital necessary to improve the railway lines, especially the one from Dublin to the west, about which we hear most. The recently published report on rail safety highlights the need for a considerable amount of money to be spent to bring trains up to an acceptable standard and to provide fast intercity transport as we face into a new millennium.</P>
    <P>We must improve our infrastructural capacity, particularly our transport system, if we want to maintain our competitive edge. Over the past decade we have put great faith in our ability to attract international investment. We have probably exhausted that resource, so we need to invest significant amounts of money to maintain our competitive position.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of catching up to do in terms of our infrastructure. We have spent a great deal of money on our road infrastructure but we are running to stand still. While the volume of traffic and freight has increased because of our successful economy, journey times are not efficient. The railways offer another opportunity to significantly add to our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>While there is an element of competition in the bus service, it is hugely inadequate, particularly in the cities. The public is abandoning the ageing bus fleet in Cork city on a daily basis. We should remember that every public transport user who becomes disgruntled when buses fail to arrive, or when they are driven past them because they are full is a potential car owner. Although it would be costly to provide subsidised public transport, it would pay for itself in a number of years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the Bill which is preparing the ground rules for competition. Perhaps we should also look at the other opportunities which exist.</P>
    <P>The debate on whether to put electricity power lines on pylons or under the water in the harbour area of Cork is causing significant controversy. The future growth and development of the economy of Cork, particularly of the lower harbour region, should not be compromised by the failure to resolve this problem. Unless it is resolved within two years, questions may be asked about whether the power supply will be able to meet the demand in that area.</P>
    <P>A substantial argument about the proliferation of ESB poles and telegraph lines, to which Deputy Ring referred, is being made on environmental grounds. They are a visual obscenity but they are necessary in a modern economy and industrial society. We should re-examine the proposal for the Cork harbour area given its natural beauty, with a view to choosing the underground option. My primary concern is that the matter be brought to a swift conclusion because we cannot jeopardise the future economic development of that area. I ask the Minister to bring this debate to a conclusion. The long-term planning of the <Col N="277" /> region requires an assurance that there will be adequate power.</P>
    <P>When the voluntary health insurance market was opened to competition, the principle of community rating applied. I come from a rural constituency which has many remote regions where the ESB charged individuals excessive prices to provide a service, although it may not have met its capital costs. The ESB will soon face competition. A mechanism must be built into this Bill which reflects the principle of community rating that applied when the health insurance market was liberalised so that people who want to live and work in remote areas of rural Ireland are not disadvantaged in terms of the cost of providing electricity. I know the Minister's heart is in the right place, so I ask her to ensure that all competitors in the market adopt such a policy.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention alternative energy sources and the 2 per cent target we must meet, which is exceedingly low given our excessive dependence on imported energy. The interconnector means we will probably buy nuclear or oil generated electricity. We have an abundance of sites suitable for tapping alternative energy sources. There is a minor controversy in my constituency about a wind farm development. Although wind farms are not particularly attractive, this is outweighed by their environmental advantages in terms of non-renewable sources of energy. It is unfortunate that many wind farms will be located in elevated and sparsely populated rural areas.</P>
    <P>Many companies are granted licences to construct wind turbines in local communities and they make money hand over fist without being obliged to give anything back to communities which bear the consequences of a scarred landscape. I would like the licences to state that there must be a link between local communities and the providers of alternative energy supplies. I have spoken to one provider who did not get a licence in the last round of applications but who was willing to enter into an arrangement with the local community whereby it would receive a percentage of the net profits or a once-off payment on an annual basis. It is only right that these companies are seen to give something back to local communities if they want to generate goodwill. At present, companies take everything but give nothing back to the local communities. I ask the Minister to factor that into the terms of the licences.</P>
    <P>I welcome competition because it is good for consumers but there is a national security interest also, which is that we should not be left without a significant generating capacity under State ownership. I am not somebody who is ideologically driven about privatisation or State ownership, but in terms of such a fundamental part of day to day life and a successful economy, it is important to retain some degree of control over our own sources of electricity. We should not be entirely dependent on imported or privately owned energy and it is important that we retain both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> Privatisation is generally good for the consumer and I welcome the fact that under the Bill new competitors will be allowed enter the market and sell electricity. It is important also that the State should retain a role in terms of generating electricity.</P>
    <P>Since its inception, the ESB has served the State well. We are facing a new millennium and many services we took for granted are feeling the competitive winds of change. I mentioned deregulation in telecommunication services and other areas where competition could be introduced such as rail transport and public transport generally. The ESB employees throughout the country have provided a service in all kinds of weather and we owe them a debt of gratitude. The staff currently working in the ESB should not fear competition because they have shown a capacity over the years to be innovative and to respond to change. This is probably the biggest change they are facing.</P>
    <P>This is an exciting time, particularly for consumers who face the prospect of cheaper energy, but it is equally a challenging time for the ESB workforce. I have no doubt, given the resilience and innovation they have shown in the past, that they will be equal to the challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The importance of electricity cannot be understated. Last Christmas and the Christmas before that, when many people in rural and urban areas were without electricity, those of my generation and younger saw for the first time how people lived without electricity in the past. I compliment the ESB workers who did not think about their own families or their Christmas dinner but went out to restore electricity supply to the people who needed it. One wonders how the hospitals and other essential services were able to continue operating. I am sure that without electricity, we could not survive today.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with some aspects of the Bill. I want to bring a matter to the Minister's attention which affects my own rural constituency. We are all aware of the rise in house prices in urban areas and people are being forced to move further away. I was in Sneem last weekend and met a group of people who spoke to me about the provision of electricity in the mountains. They told me that because of the millennium bug a large number of foreigners are going to live in the mountains and they need electricity. Apart from that, many people have to move out of urban areas and the difficulties being experienced in Kerry are the same as those in Dublin in terms of house prices.</P>
      <P>A small number of farmers living in remote areas cannot afford to provide electricity for themselves. I dealt with a case some years ago of a man living on his own who did not have electricity because he could not afford the cost of the poles required to conduct electricity to his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> I ask the Minister to bear in mind that there are certain areas without electricity, particularly in the mountains. We should also be mindful of the workers in the ESB who had a difficult task in completing the electrification scheme. The terrain in which they had to work was extremely difficult, and tribute should be paid to those workers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to implement the EU directive on electricity and to change the law to allow for competition. What is the policy for the commercial State sector? The Minister has not given any indication of what she intends to do with the resources she will have following the sale of the ESB.</P>

      <P>Hopefully the Minister will have resources and something productive will be done.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty with the option the Minister has taken, particularly in regard to the security of the workers' jobs. This should be done in such a way as to maintain Government control over the industry, which is vital to our economic well-being, rather than vesting the power in foreign interests. There should be clear, democratic accountability on the part of those responsible for policy and the regulation of the industry. Workers in the new companies to be introduced should enjoy the rights of the existing employees, particularly the right to join a trade union of their choice and to have that union recognised. That is a fundamental right for any worker. Domestic customers in remote areas should be guaranteed a supply of electricity at an affordable price. A wide range of choices was available to the Minister but the road she is taking will damage the integrity of the industry, the workers in that industry and the customers, both domestic and commercial.</P>
      <P>We had a difficulty some time ago in regard to the turf-burning station in Cahirciveen and I have a concern in regard to that. What is the position in regard to Tarbert which has a large number of workers from Kerry, Clare and Limerick? I fear for the security of their jobs and the types of jobs they will have in the future.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also that we will have difficulty with the guarantee of supply. The commitment of the ESB workers is second to none. If the same problems arise in the future that occurred last Christmas and the Christmas before, will the workers have the same level of commitment in such an emergency? Will they work in an environment where they will be willing to go out like they did last Christmas? Conditions for workers in the ESB are very good and they have a great pay structure. Can the Minister give a commitment that privatisation will not spell disaster for ESB workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is dangerous that decisions concerning the ESB will not be taken in this country, but perhaps <Col N="280" /> at boardrooms in New York, Tokyo or Berlin. We will have no control over an essential service. That is one of the main difficulties I have, particularly concerning the workforce. The Minister should re-examine the matter to make sure that when she goes down this road, workers will be the number one priority. It is also important for customers that the price of electricity will not shoot through the roof. When the electricity service goes into private ownership we will have no control over it. I would be very careful before signing the deal.</P>
    <P>As regards the type of fuel the ESB will use, there will be a heavy reliance upon imported gas. Even though it is cheaper than other fuels, it is not very desirable because of the insecurity of supply. A diversity of fuels should be used, including gas, oil, coal, peat, water and wind power. We should not confine ourselves to using imported gas because, although it is cheap, where would we be if it dried up? </P>
    <P>I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief comment on this important Bill. Listening to the debate, it is hard to believe that rural electrification has still not reached some parts of the country, although this is not something I can complain of in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The Minister is laying down the ground rules for introducing privatisation and competition in the electricity sector. I have no objection to that but what concerns me is how one goes about doing it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the great work the ESB has done. Rural electrification brought a whole new aspect to life in many places we thought would never have the benefit of an ESB supply. I recall, as a young boy, seeing workmen manually bringing electricity poles to remote areas. It was work that would not be undertaken in such a manner now because the unions would not allow it. However, those men did it and took pride in the fact that they were bringing electricity to people in remote areas. They must be complimented for having done so.</P>
      <P>In this House we are often swift to criticise semi-State bodies and State agencies but the ESB can stand shoulder high, having provided an excellent and efficient electricity service. It has done a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That commitment to work practice was seen in the best light during the recent storms last Christmas when falling trees, poles and other objects brought down ESB lines. The commitment that was shown in the 1950s and 1960s when rural electrification was being established, was clearly demonstrated again when ESB crews went out in the winter storms to restore power supplies. I pay tribute to the ESB staff in County Cavan, who provided a 24-hour service at their Moynehall depot. Because of the number of calls coming in there it was not possible to ring through, so I went out to the local head office. I was highly impressed by the efficient manner in <Col N="281" /> which the person in charge was in touch with his repair crews around the county.</P>
    <P>The ESB responded immediately to requests from people whose lines has been broken the previous night. Power was restored as quickly as possible on a temporary basis and crews returned later to make full repairs. That work should be recognised. It is service one would not get from private enterprise. ESB crews worked 24 hours a day, including Saturdays and Sundays, putting their lives at risk. During the winter storms, one ESB worker was seriously injured when cutting a tree that had fallen across power lines. It shows that ESB personnel take risks for us, but it is something we tend to take for granted. I appreciate the service the ESB has given and the work that has been done.</P>
    <P>I cannot fathom how the Minister will go about privatising the ESB. Perhaps she can tease the matter out a bit more for us. I know what private enterprise will do. The people involved will look on the ESB sell-off as an opportunity to take over areas of greatest demand for electricity where the best returns will be made, but who then will provide the service nationally?</P>
    <P>It is a balancing act because it is not as economical to provide electricity to remote areas. It is more profitable to provide such a service to villages, towns and cities, and to large industries. Having control over semi-State bodies, we must ensure that the ESB supply is available nationwide at all times, and at the same cost to everybody.</P>
    <P>In that regard, will the Minister consider a problem I have come across recently, although it does not occur very often? That is where somebody wants to upgrade an industry in what would probably be considered a remote area. To upgrade to three phase, the ESB must put down about ten or 15 poles from the nearest transformer. In such a case, the ESB requests a contribution of £15,000 from a small industrialist, which is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet, if that plant was on the outskirts of a large town or city, where industry is already established, there would be no such cost. It is unfair to that person and I am sure it is not a unique case. It is wrong to expect a small industry &ndash; providing a service and creating local employment &ndash; to accept that to upgrade the availability of power &ndash; which is necessary to develop and expand the business &ndash; the ESB can seek a contribution in the region of £15,000. No <Col N="282" /> grant aid is available for this cost. If a grant was available, either through the Leader scheme or some State agency, it would lessen the cost and go some way towards helping the person to provide that service. However, it is not eligible for grant aid and has to stand alone. That is not acceptable to me. The ESB should provide this service, irrespective of where the industry is established, to ensure that jobs are created and maintained in rural areas. We all speak about the drive to create jobs, but this is one positive way in which the Minister could make a contribution towards ensuring that we do so.</P>
      <P>When the original plans were being drawn up to provide rural electrification, it was to areas of greatest demand at the time. We now have a demand for housing from people who wish to establish holiday homes in remote parts of the country, including my own county. We should promote and encourage this nationwide development which is bringing people into rural areas where agriculture, which was the backbone of rural industry, is in decline. While some people are getting out of farming and young people are moving away, others are interested in enjoying the peace and quiet of rural Ireland and they wish to establish holiday or weekend homes. They are people from towns and cities, as well as emigrants who wish to establish a holiday home here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Government has approved a proposal submitted by ACC and the TSB banks that the two banks be merged and floated on the Stock Exchange. My Department is currently in discussions with both banks about the arrangements to be made for managing the merger-flotation and, in due course, I will introduce legislation to give effect to the merger-flotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> As part of its decision on this matter, the Government also accepted the principle of a single employee share ownership plan for the staff of the merged bank and authorised me to enter into negotiations to this end with the parties concerned. The detailed terms and conditions of this ESOP remain to be negotiated, but I envisage that up to 5 per cent of the shares of the merged bank will be available for allocation to employees in return for significant, quantifiable and verifiable productivity enhancement and flexibility. A further 9.9 per cent of the shares will be made available to employees at a cost equivalent to the current valuation of the existing operations of the ACC and the TSB.</P>
    <P>The question of free or discounted shares for customers arises only in the case of organisations such as mutual building societies which are owned by their customers. This does not apply in the case of the TSB or any of the State companies such as the ACC or the ICC. The proceeds from the sale of the TSB and public assets will accrue to the Exchequer. However, subject to confirmation that there are no problems in relation to domestic or EU legal requirements, I am prepared to reserve a specific number of shares at the offer price for long standing customers of ACC-TSB when floated on the Stock Exchange. I will shortly advertise for advisers in relation to the flotation process and the question of an allotment of shares at the offer price to long-standing customers is one of the issues that will be examined in detail by these advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to assume the Minister and the State are the ultimate shareholders in both cases? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the ACC I hold all the shares and in the case of the TSB I am entitled to the proceeds of its sale. As the Deputy is undoubtedly aware, the TSB is an unusual hybrid legal entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In motor racing parlance, therefore, the Minister is in pole position when it comes to organising gifts of shares or the sale of shares. I understand from his reply that he considered whether long-standing customers of the TSB or the ACC should get shares and decided they should not be allocated free shares but offered a number of shares at the offer price, the bids for which would be confined to long-standing customers. What does the Minister mean by long-standing customers? Does he mean deposit holders or any person who has done business with the ACC or the TSB over a long period of time? By &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; does he mean a period of time, the frequency of transactions or the quantum of business processed? The Minister said a number of shares would be offered. What percentage tranche of shares has he in mind? Is it 5 per cent or 10 per cent? He referred to the offer price. Will there be an obligation on long-standing cus<Col N="284" /> tomers who purchase shares to hold those shares for a specific time or will they be able to dispose of them straight away, if they were so inclined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the Deputy up to speed on what I envisage will be the process. In a short period of time I hope to be in a position to advertise for advisers. Such an advertisement will have to be placed in the EU Journal and national newspapers and a period of 52 days must elapse between the posting of the advertisement and the closing of that process. I expect advisers will be appointed in June. I will take advice from the advisers on the questions raised by the Deputy. He raised legitimate questions as to the percentage of shares I will allocate to long-standing customers. He also asked who would be classified as a long-standing customer. I will consider these matters when the advisers are appointed.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the flotation of the new merged bank will occur mid-2000. Some time will elapse before we come to deal with the key questions posed today. As I said in my reply, I am not opposed to allocating a tranche of shares to long-standing customers at the offer price. There is no question of allocating free shares to customers of either institution, but I am open to the suggestion of allocating a specific percentage of shares in the merged bank at the offer price, subject to any further considerations under EU and domestic law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's response. Will he agree the position of long-standing customers of the TSB is analogous in some ways to that of members of building societies, in so far as the ethos of the TSB is different from that of the other commercial banks? The Minister should have given greater consideration to the possibility of allocating free or discounted shares to long-standing customers. Does he envisage the merger and flotation happening contemporaneously or the merger happening first, thereby allowing the position to settle, followed by the flotation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point concerning long-standing customers was put forcefully to me, but I decided to specify the allocation of a tranche of shares at the offer price subject to the conditions I outlined. I am not prepared to offer free shares in either of these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will appoint advisers in the next few months and, subject to their advice, I envisage the merger and flotation taking place at the same time. Both entities will cease to exist on the day the flotation takes place. The merger and flotation will happen simultaneously. That is what I consider the most appropriate way to proceed. Perhaps the advisers may advocate a different approach, but that is the stance I adopted in negotiations with the TSB and the ACC during the past 20 months since I became Minister. The idea that the TSB should be included in this process was not mooted when <Col N="285" /> I first came to office, but it has been put forward since. My preferred approach is that the merger and flotation will happen simultaneously, subject to the advice of the advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is disappointing. I do not believe the different legal basis of building societies and organisations such as the TSB is sufficient to justify the different treatment proposed. One could argue that customers of the ACC and the TSB have made almost as big a contribution as the employees. The Minister said employees will be given 5 per cent of the shares of the merged bank as a gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put my question and the Deputy can then respond to it. The Minister has proposed dividing 14.9 per cent of the shares into a tranche of 5 per cent and a tranche of 9.9 per cent and he referred to a mechanism for the 9.9 per cent tranche which I did not understand. Will he explain the manner in which employees can avail of the 5 per cent tranche and the 9.9 per cent tranche of shares? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is subject to further negotiations with the unions. We have made a good deal of progress. There has been great co-operation between the trade unions and staff representatives of both institutions. The leaders in both institutions are farseeing. One would be amazed at the insight they have into the future; the management of other institutions could learn from them. Negotiations will have to take place on this process, but there will not be a free offer of 5 per cent of shares of the merged bank. Taking Telecom Éireann as an analogy, the five per cent share allocation to Telecom Éireann employees is for verifiable productivity changes and flexibility. I envisage a similar process in regard to ACC, TSB and ICC and that up to 5 per cent of shares will be allocated, as in Telecom Éireann, on foot of verifiable productivity changes and flexibility. ESOP will be offered 9.9 per cent of shares at the current valuation of the operations of ACC and the TSB. That is the situation in Telecom Éireann and is what I envisage happening in the ACC-TSB merger flotation to which this question relates and in the ICC deal which we hope to conclude in the middle of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will learn a great deal from what will happen in Telecom Éireann because the unions are working in partnership with the advisers and the Department of Public Enterprise in that regard. These are matters for negotiation between the union representatives and management side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> What will pertain in Telecom Éireann will be more or less the template to be followed in other <Col N="286" /> situations. The situations are not exactly the same and the process will be refined in ACC, ICC and TSB but the Telecom Éireann example is a pretty good starting point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government decided to dispose of ICC, agreement was reached with the trade unions and a guarantee was given that there would not be compulsory redundancies as any purchaser would be required to give an undertaking to that effect.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <P>In the memorandum of understanding which was concluded between ACC and the TSB and submitted to me in the past month, it is envisaged that as in the case of the Irish Permanent there will be a five year moratorium which will prevent anyone acquiring a shareholding above and beyond a certain percentage. That provision is in the memorandum of understanding between the ACC and TSB, which I am considering at present. I do not have an objection in principle to it.</P>

The proposal was put forward by the trade unions and they envisage a total flotation of the company which is contained in the memorandum of understanding upon which we have agreed. The trade unions engaged in long and extensive discussions with their members before putting these proposals on the table. The intention is for a 100 per cent flotation of the merged ACC-TSB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions to end EU duty free and tax free sales in 1999 have already been taken by the EU Council in the context of the &ldquo;1993 Tax Package&rdquo;. Duty free sales to travellers going to destinations outside the EU are not affected and should continue.</P>
      <P>The relevant EU Directives here have been adopted. The duty free measure was not adopted in isolation. Most notably Council Directive 92/12/EEC provides for the abolition of duty free sales for intra-EU travel after 30 June 1999. This and the other decisions relating to tax free selling, formed a part of an overall single market tax package. The EU Commission and some other member states agreed to the extension of duty free selling in 1992 until 1999 as representing a final concession. That view is maintained by the Commission &ndash; which initially sought immediate abolition in 1992 and now remains opposed to any extension &ndash; and by a small number of the member states of the EU, who are also opposed to any extension of time for duty free sales now.</P>
      <P>As this House is aware, Ireland has actively and persistently raised this issue within the EU at various levels over the years. The decision to end duty free sales was confirmed by the Commission at the ECOFIN meeting on 19 May 1998 when I raised the topic and was, at that time, supported by many member states. Since that time, both Germany and France have indicated their concern at the proposed abolition and the mood in Council has moved towards a reconsideration of the issue.</P>
      <P>At the Vienna Summit in December 1998, the EU Heads of State and Government considered this issue in depth, leading to a mandate to the ECOFIN Ministers and the EU Commission. The Commission was requested to produce a report for ECOFIN.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday, the Commission responded to that mandate. Following its examination, the Commission report considers that the abolition of duty free sales for intra-EU travel will not have a significant negative impact on employment overall, and says the extension of such sales would create uncertainty and disadvantage normal retailers and other means of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> The Commission states that the factors it took into account included the following. The growing demand for transport services, stimulated notably by the existence of the Single Market, is not likely to be affected by the abolition of duty free sales. Most travellers, it argues, will continue to shop during waiting time at the airports or spending time on ferries, even after the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales. This, it says, is confirmed by the experience at US airports where there is continuing expansion of tax-paid shopping malls.</P>
    <P>The Commission also points out that the difference between some prices duty free and duty paid is often insignificant, particularly in the case of goods other than tobacco. The Commission has also referred to the gain to the national exchequers if duty free sales are abolished and has commented on the growth of employment in high-street retailers.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed with the Commission report. The study which we commissioned from KPMG was produced and sent to the Commission. It pointed to the potential negative effects on employment particularly in the ferry sector. The Commission report is not a sufficient reply to the clear request of the Vienna Council for a short-term extension of the transition arrangements for ending duty-free sales. The Commission has not made any proposal in this regard.</P>
    <P>Neither do I believe that use of the existing EU measures, such as the Structural Funds, where such could apply, as the Commission suggests is the best solution to use to limit the impact of this change in employment. While such measures have a role to play, their impact is necessarily limited and an extension of time is still the outcome that we will support at ECOFIN.</P>
    <P>The next step is for the Commission's report to be considered by the Finance and Economic Ministers at the ECOFIN Council on March 15, when the Commission will present its report.</P>
    <P>I doubt that it will be well received. It has already been criticised by a number of member states. I intend to continue to press the Commission on this matter.</P>
    <P>In the event that we do not convert the Commission at that meeting it will most likely become a matter which the Heads of State and Government may wish to consider at the European Council in Berlin on 24-25 March.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the broad bipartisan support we have in the House to see this matter resolved on a satisfactory basis. The Government has set out its view that a deferral of the abolition of duty free sales is necessary.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government and I, will continue to work to that end, both at Council or through bilateral contacts. In the end it will be necessary for the Council to convince the Commission that an extension is necessary here.</P>

      <P>The decision has moved on considerably since Ireland raised the matter. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise and I, spent a great deal of time at Council meetings drumming up support for this and it is only fair to say that when we started we were in a minority of one. In the intervening period most member states have come on side and, as expressed at the Vienna Council, most of them wish to see deferral of the 30 June deadline. However, as I pointed out previously in this House and in other fora, the unanimous support of the 15 member states is required.</P>
      <P>Although nearly all member states favour extending the deadline, some are still holding out. In one member state, if one is to believe media reports, one of the government's coalition partners has said it will withdraw from government if the decision is changed. Much as the prime minister of that country might wish to sit on the fence on this issue, as Deputy Noonan and I might wish to do in such circumstances, his dilemma is understandable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister. Obviously, other governments have had worse troubles than this Government in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is hard for the Irish Government to prosecute its case since the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, agreed to the package in 1993, failed to exercise the Irish veto on that occasion and did not negotiate a sufficiently long transition period to protect the jobs now at risk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission is of the view that seven or eight years was sufficiently long for member states to deal with these matters. When this decision was made it was part of a single tax package dealing with a wide variety of indirect taxation. The only area on which progress has been made, and for which the Commission is holding out, is keeping to the deadline for the abolition of duty free sales.</P>
      <P>When this was negotiated a variety of measures in the VAT and other areas were on the table. However, progress in the other areas has been similar to watching paint dry; nothing has happened. The Commission decided to take up duty free sales and insist that it be abolished on 30 June 1999. The abolition of duty free sales was originally part of an overall tax package and it was in that context that member states gave it consideration in the early 1990s. Realistically, however, nothing fundamental has happened in the other indirect taxation areas. The Irish Government, therefore, believes there is no justification for pressing ahead with the abolition of duty free sales when it has been proved beyond doubt that there will be job losses. Even if there was only one net job loss, it would be too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a small gain for the Exchequer in terms of extra taxation but, in the overall scheme, that is not a large hill of beans. The Govern<Col N="290" /> ment's position is to continue to press for the deferral of the date and, at this stage, the majority of member states support our position. However, only one country need hold out for the decision to remain in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the advisers who drafted his reply appear to be suffering from a misconception in putting forward the argument that because people will still be waiting in airports for planes and at ferry ports for ferries the same quantum of retail business will probably be conducted. That is to miss the central point. It is not the quantum of retail business that is at issue but the margin. Aer Rianta's margin will be cut to about one-third of its current level even if the same amount of retail business is conducted.</P>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands one of the fundamentals of this issue. Does he plan to hold talks with the ferry companies and Aer Rianta to ascertain whether the retail side can be developed so that not only the same quantum of business can be retained at air and ferry ports but that the margin can also be preserved? Otherwise the cost will run into Aer Rianta landing charges at Shannon, Cork and Dublin and will in turn end up in airline fares. As the ferry companies will not get their margin on excise free goods any longer, they will also be obliged to increase fares. Is the Minister aware that the primary ferry company serving Rosslare to France has announced it might have to go off the route for long stretches of the year if duty free sales are not retained?</P>

      <P>My reply was long and the Deputy appears to have misunderstood what I said about waiting in airports. That point was made by the Commission in its report last week; it is not the Government's position. The Commission stated that the factors it took into account included the waiting time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission said that in its report. The relevant paragraph from my reply is that:</P>
      <P>The Commission states that the factors which it took into account included the following. The growing demand for transport services, stimulated notably by the existence of the single market, is not likely to be affected by the abolition of duty free sales. Most travellers, it argues, will continue to shop during waiting time at the airports or spending time on ferries, even after the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales. This, it says, is confirmed by the experience at US airports where there is continuing expansion of tax paid shopping malls.</P>
      <P>That is the Commission's opinion but the Government disagrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government commissioned KPMG to produce a report some time ago and I submitted <Col N="291" /> it to the Commission. The report dealt thoroughly with the matters raised by the Deputy. As a result of my visits to the regional airports, which I undertook before the ECOFIN meeting last May, I am conversant with the position of the regional airports and effects of the abolition of duty free sales. In one of the airports, for example, the removal of its duty free sales profits would put it in a loss making position. Even in Shannon Airport, the removal of the profits on duty free sales would have a severe effect on its surplus.</P>

      <P>The situation in Dublin is a little different. That has been the basis of the Irish case. We do not agree with the Commission's assessment.</P>
      <P>The Commission was asked at the Vienna Council to prepare this report and it has done so. The report has not yet been discussed because ECOFIN is not due to meet until 15 March. I am certain it will not be greeted with warmth and applause. However, nobody has been in doubt for some time that the Commission is taking a hard line stance on this issue and the fact that last week's report indicates no change in its position is not surprising.</P>
      <P>However, I am confident this matter will be revisited at the Heads of States meeting on 24 and 25 March. If not, it will undoubtedly arise at the Cologne Summit in June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The national lottery is conducted under licence granted by the Minister for Finance. Section 3 of the National Lottery Act, 1986 makes specific provisions for the granting of licences by the Minister. First, the initial licence granted to a person may not exceed ten years. Second, the Minister at any time may revoke this licence and grant a further licence to the original licence holder. Also, the duration of subsequent licences is entirely at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> The licence to hold the national lottery was awarded to An Post in October 1986. The National Lottery company began operations in March 1987. It was required under the terms of the licence to introduce an on-line lottery game as soon as possible. In November 1987, the board of the National Lottery company contracted out the provision of technical support for this on-line game to GTECH following a public tendering process. The duration of this contract was for five years from 1 April, 1988.</P>
    <P>During 1992, the lottery company concluded that it needed to upgrade its IT support for lotto and for the instant games both to improve services for its customers and to position itself to respond to the challenge posed by the UK lottery. Accordingly, in July of that year, the company issued a request for proposals for an enhanced on-line IT support base. GTECH emerged as the most competitive bidder.</P>
    <P>In November 1992, the lottery company advised my Department that the board of the company had decided to accept the GTECH proposal. Noting that even more competitive commercial terms would be available if the duration of the lottery licence were to be extended by 3.5 years to end of March 2000, the company inquired if the Minister would be agreeable to issuing an extended licence.</P>
    <P>Having evaluated the business case for this proposal, the Department recommended to the Minister in February 1993 that he should exercise his powers under section 3 of the 1986 Act to grant an extended licence subject to the negotiation of a reduced management fee with An Post, which would ultimately benefit the national lottery beneficiary fund. The Minister approved this proposal, negotiations took place with An Post and the office of the Attorney General was consulted. Finally, in December 1993, the Minister revoked the initial lottery licence granted to An Post in October 1986 and issued a new licence to run to end March 2000.</P>
    <P>Throughout this process, all negotiations with GTECH were conducted by the National Lottery. At no stage was there any direct contact between GTECH and the Department or the Minister. Neither is there evidence from departmental records of representations made by or on behalf of GTECH on this issue.</P>
    <P>I place on record my view that since commencing operations in March 1987, An Post National Lottery company has conducted the national lottery in an exemplary manner, building up massive public support, as evidenced by annual sales of well over £300 million. It generated more than £900 million for the National Lottery beneficiary fund is the period 1987-99.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there was considerable interest in the licence when the Government originally decided to have a national lottery. The licence was awarded following a public tender. Why did the Minister of the day, <Col N="293" /> Deputy Bertie Ahern, and his Department decide not to have a public tender process when the licence was being extended? Why was it done so secretly that until earlier this year, one of the main competitors &ndash; Rehab &ndash; did not know the licence had been extended from 1997 until 2000? It was only when it thought it should prepare for the next public tender for the lottery that it realised this secret extension had taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two contracts at issue. The Deputy's supplementary question relates to the extension of the licence to the National Lottery. When the Act was being drawn up in 1986, when Fine Gael was in Government, section 3 related to the grant by the Minister of a licence to hold a national lottery. That section, specifically under subsection (2), states:</P>
      <P>Upon or at any time after the expiration or revocation of a licence, the Minister may grant a further licence under subsection (1) of this section to the person who was the holder of the first-mentioned licence.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>When a licence is granted to a person for the first time, the duration of the licence shall be such period not exceeding 10 years as the Minister may determine; the duration of any subsequent licence granted to the person shall be such period as the Minister may determine.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may at any time, for reasons that seem to him to be sufficient and are stated in notice in writing given to the licensee, revoke a licence.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was being considered, something to which I was not party, it was provided under subsection (3) to allow these powers to the Minister for Finance. I am sure there were good reasons advocated at the time, which would have been part of the Government memoranda and the supporting documentation, but it was decided to put it clearly in section 3 and the relevant subsections. As has been pointed out outside the House in regard to the licence, the National Lottery decided to upgrade its facilities and had a public tendering process which GTECH won.</P>
      <P>The National Lottery then approached the Department of Finance and told it this company would invest in new technology and it would like the licence extended. The Department recommended to the then Minister for Finance to do so and he did that. That was the only involvement of the current Taoiseach in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the unsavoury reputation of GTECH, under its previous owner in particular, in other jurisdictions in which it has operated? That reputation is associated with bribery of public officials and politicians. Is the Minister satisfied as to the probity <Col N="294" /> of the company under its current ownership and management? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There must have been similar considerations about it in 1986 when another Government, of which Fianna Fáil was not a part, was in power. If there are doubts about that operation, they were as valid then as they are now.</P>
      <P>The award of the licence for the equipment in 1986 or subsequently in the 1990s when Deputy Ahern was Minister for Finance was a matter for the national lottery, not the Minister for Finance. He was involved with the extension of the licence to run the national lottery to An Post on foot of recommendations from An Post to the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance's officials considered it and recommended it to the Minister, who granted the extension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the question marks over GTECH arose in the late 1990s. Mr. Richard Branson of Virgin won a notorious libel case against it in that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

Negotiations have been ongoing between the Central Statistics Office, the Department of Finance and EUROSTAT in the intervening period. This week we received a letter from EUROSTAT which was negative in response and in tone. We replied to EUROSTAT yesterday and, as I said in an interview this morning, I regard this as part of the ongoing negotiations on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It remains the objective of this Government to secure regionalisation for the country. While this matter was debated at length some time ago, the Minister and Secretaries Group, which meets regularly, asked the Department of Finance to prepare a document on the possibility of regionalisation. That work was done between March and June. That document was then submitted to the Ministers and secretaries group and, with the agreement of the group, it was included in the memorandum for Government which decided, after much deliberation, that an appli<Col N="296" /> cation would be made to Europe for sub-regionalisation of the country. The reasons given at the time are as valid now as they were then and the situation has not changed. We intend to pursue this matter with the utmost intensity in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan asked earlier about the application. When negotiations are completed all these documents will come into the public domain, but it is the understanding that during negotiations briefing and background documents are not made available, though they will become available in time. In the reply that we sent to EUROSTAT on foot of the letter received from that body, the Irish position remains as it was. Our application seeks to grant 15 counties Objective One status and it is on that basis we have replied to EUROSTAT. We will continue to press for that because, as was explained at the time, that region qualifies in all aspects for Objective One status.</P>
      <P>I find it somewhat disingenuous for EUROSTAT, a statistical agency, in replying to us, to enter into matters which my officials and I feel is outside its remit. Other countries have succeeded in retaining Objective One status for regions they have put forward whose average GDP is 74.8 and 74.9 per cent; <i>mirabile dictu</i>, they came just beneath the threshold.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan raised what another Commissioner said some months ago, but this is supposed to be a purely statistical exercise. That is EUROSTAT's remit. Furthermore, under the principles of subsidiarity, it is a matter for the member state in question to designate regions and to provide for administrative structures consistent with the member state's legal and institutional framework. Deputy Deenihan is correct in that there is a reference in the reply from EUROSTAT to the proposed regional structures, but the Irish Government's approach to the new regional structures was innovative and welcomed by the Irish Association of Regional Authorities, which issued a press release when the Government made its decision in February and welcomed the transfer of powers to the new regional authorities, further welcoming what was envisaged in those new authorities and the transfer of powers thereto. Therefore, in our reply to EUROSTAT we pointed out inconsistencies, misapprehensions and a lack of clarity of thought in some parts of its letter. We also sought a meeting at the highest level with EUROSTAT, and officials from my Department and the Central Statistics Office hope to meet with EUROSTAT in the coming week.</P>

They will see the results of a distinctly more hostile attitude towards Ireland that is due in part to the plan the Minister has proposed to Brussels.

The consistent position espoused on behalf of the Labour Party and Democratic Left is that regionalisation should not be considered. As I pointed out in earlier debates on this matter&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like the way the ACC and TSB are to go off into the air. I thank Deputy Noonan for reminding me of that point. The Government is formulating its position after considerable thought. The easy thing to do would have been to accept things as they were, to do nothing about it and to leave the whole country as a region in transition. That would have been the easiest political thing to do, but it would have been the wrong thing to do in the national interest. Having considered the matter on foot of the report presented to the Ministers and secretaries' group last summer after considerable research by officials of my Department and others, it was shown quite clearly that there was both a short and long-term advantage to Ireland in pursuing the sub-regionalisation idea. That is why the Government made its decision; it was the correct one then and it is correct now to pursue it. It may not be true of parts of Dublin, but on the western seaboard, from Donegal to Kerry, people are dependent on agriculture, tourism and fishing&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy was here in the autumn when the issue of regionalisation was considered. During that debate the Taoiseach, others Ministers and I outlined the reasons for pursuing the sub-regionalisation approach. They were not solely because of the extra quantum of money that could be gained. That was only one of the reasons to pursue the sub-regionalisation approach. Other issues such as State aids, the additional amount of money, the phasing out at the ending of 2006 and what was likely to happen afterwards were also considered. When all the views were put to the Ministers and secretaries group and considered by the Government it was obvious to us, and agreed by most Members, that it was in the national interest to have sub-regionalisation for Ireland. That has been the basis of the Irish position and continues to be so.</P>

In October-November on the occasion of our visit to Brussels, our application had not been submitted and we had no idea how many counties would be included. We are still dithering with our application and with the man from south Kerry. How much support has the Irish application received from Commissioner Pádraig Flynn? How many contacts or meetings has the Minister had with him? Has Commissioner Flynn's support for the Irish application been modified or tempered in any way by virtue of the ongoing row with his former colleagues in Government?

Last November, I visited Brussels with the Border regionalisation authority to meet Commissioner Wulf-Mathies. She assured me, in the presence of that deputation, that the necklace of counties surrounding the six northern counties, which comprise the Border region, was well qualified as a region and within 75 per cent of GDP and that an application could not be refused. Given that goodwill from a senior Commissioner in Brussels what went wrong that our application has been thrown out and the six Border counties which need to keep up with the improvements, are now in a wilderness due to incompetence on the part of the Government in dealing with what was an important issue?</P>

The decision to apply appears to have been a snap one at the eleventh hour. We are now approaching the twelfth hour and have to resubmit our application.

      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy has said. The country was sub-regionalised following careful deliberation going back to the debate in the autumn. I do not agree the decision to submit the Irish application in 1998 was connected to the difficulties with the Commission. I regard the reply from EUROSTAT as part of the ongoing negotiations on Agenda 2000. This matter will be resolved one way or the other. It may be resolved in the context of the overall scheme of things. There is considerable pressure from the German Presidency to have the Agenda 2000 proposals concluded by the end of its presidency. A meeting will take place tomorrow between the heads of State. A meeting of the heads of State will also take place <Col N="301" /> at the end of March, when all these matters will be considered. The question of sub-regionalising the country has been around for some time.

Will he agree that had only the three regions been submitted some, if not all, of the problems raised would not have arisen?

Our record in EU negotiations has been good until recently. Does the Minister accept that this debacle, which was solely to keep Deputy Healy-Rae on board, has done us enormous damage not just on this issue but also on urban and rural renewal and CAP? The delivery on those issues has been poor of late. Can the Minister give a commitment to the House that negotiations with Deputy Healy-Rae will stop and the Government will adopt a proper regional approach acceptable to EUROSTAT and Brussels, so that the Border, west, and midlands regions, for which he originally intended to apply, do not lose out? We depend on the Minister and he is with us but unfortunately he was overruled by the Taoiseach, purely for political expediency.</P>

      <P>The local radio stations will be busy tonight. I will clear up the question about Kerry and Clare, which I endeavoured to do last autumn but it fell on deaf ears &ndash; unfortunately, if a lie is repeated often enough it is believed. The move to sub-regionalise the country was set in train by the Ministers and secretaries group in March 1998. The group was asked to look at a range of questions on whether a sub-regionalised application for Ireland would be in the long-term interests of the country, and to assemble relevant information. That information was compiled in June and the record shows it included Kerry and Clare as part of the western region. I have repeated this on more than one occasion. I did not find a representation from anyone, either on this side of the House, the other side or the Independent benches, about the inclusion of Kerry or Clare until the autumn of last year, well after the Ministers and secretaries group had included those counties as part of the new western seaboard region.</P>

      <P>On radio this morning the Minister said the EUROSTAT letter did not refer to Kerry and Clare but he said in the House that there was a reference.

If that approach had been adopted, the solution to this problem would have been tailor-made. When Ireland submitted its disadvantaged areas plan to the European Union, it was readily accepted and there was no stipulation about county units.

It is my intention that this scheme will ensure that persons with a grave disability should receive compensation which fairly reflects the seriousness of their injury, while those with minor disability <Col N="306" /> should receive payments which reflect the lesser effect of their injuries in their everyday life. I would envisage the scheme settling the outstanding claims within three years instead of the estimated 17 years required to process them through the courts.</P>
    <P>In recent months, many individuals contacted me expressing support for a proposal on these lines and asking me to provide an alternative mechanism to litigation in the courts for the processing of genuine compensation claims. I hope the representative associations will come on board and support a genuine attempt to resolve this issue fairly and speedily.</P>
    <P>To date, my Department has received a total of 13,880 claims for alleged loss of hearing from current and former members of the Defence Forces. Almost 4,000 of the claims have been received from serving members of the Defence Force. This figure is approximately 35 per cent of the current strength. Of the total number of claims received, 143 have been cleared by way of court awards, 2,197 by out of court settlements and 126 have been withdrawn or dismissed which leaves a total of 11,414 outstanding. Almost £51 million has been paid in awards and settlements and £14 million has been paid on plaintiffs' legal costs.</P>

      <P>Up to yesterday, the book of appeal in the Hanley case, which was heard on 21 July 1998, had not been lodged with the Supreme Court by the Minister's lawyers. Is that not somewhat inconsistent, given the Minister's statement that he intends to establish a tribunal to which the Hanley case is central in terms of any decisions he might make? I welcome the U-turn he has made on establishing the tribunal but the delay in lodging the appeal in this important case shows that his policy is questionable.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he directed his Department to produce proposals last weekend. Is he stating that he has no detailed proposals in his possession and that he has gone public without the agreement of or without concluding negotiations with those people who will be affected by a tribunal, if one is established? Why did he do that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is aware that I have not made a U-turn. As long ago as last June I informed the House that I was interested in establishing a non-judicial system to deal with these outstanding cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> The Hanley judgment increased dramatically the potential liability of the State. Preparations are being made for the appeal which is to be heard in April. There are no guarantees but I am proceeding along the lines outlined last year. I was asked by Members and others to provide an alternative system on which considerable work has been done. A scale of tariffs has been devised. There has been considerable consultation with the legal profession. Individual legal firms which have submitted a considerable number of cases have also been consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the case which the Minister said is central has not been appealed since last June. Why did the Minister go public before agreement was reached with PDFORRA? The provision of a tribunal would ensure fairness for the taxpayer and claimants and lead to a considerable reduction in legal fees. What attempts has the Minister made to bring PDFORRA on side on this important issue? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted with the response of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and RACO in favour of the proposals. I am disappointed that PDFORRA has not come on board. I have, however, a much wider remit. I represent the taxpayer and the members of the Defence Forces who have not made a claim. A huge number of claimants are retired members of the Defence Forces who are represented by me, not PDFORRA. I have indicated the direction I have taken and I am seeking a response. From the positive response I have received from a number of quarters, including this House, I am on the right road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>PDFORRA is the largest representative body in the Defence Forces. As a former shop steward, I find it unusual that the Minister has been unable to obtain its view. How many meetings has he had with PDFORRA since its AGM in Ennis? Approximately 75 per cent of cases are settled out of court without an admission of liability. What is the reason for this? To remove doubt and demonstrate that claimants have a major health problem the obvious thing to do would be to proceed with cases in court. Is it the Minister's intention to discuss his proposals with the representative bodies before the tribunal is established? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief of Staff and RACO which represents officers support the proposal. I would welcome the view of PDFORRA, of which the majority of claimants are not members. I am anxious to help in any way I can to reach a consensus. From the comments of its representatives it appears PDFORRA wants to extract the last penny from the taxpayer, regardless of whether injuries are serious or minor and claims genuine. Negotiations take place between the legal representatives of the State and the plaintiffs. When <Col N="308" /> the amounts sought are reduced to a level that is fair and affordable we will settle outside court. We are not interested in haggling in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no request for a formal meeting with PDFORRA since its AGM in Ennis. The normal practice is for representatives of PDFORRA to meet officials of the Department. If they come unstuck, I may be requested to intervene. They are to meet today. I have had private discussions with individual members of PDFORRA. They are anxious to ensure a non-judicial system is put in place. There is no argument between me and PDFORRA. The question is how far can I go in representing the interests of the wider community. This gives rise to conflict.</P>

      <P>The Minister will meet the interests of the broader community if a successful tribunal is established. I am appalled at his lack of concern about his failure to reach agreement with PDFORRA. It appears he has not even tried to negotiate. Who will constitute the tribunal and will provision be made for interim or provisional payments?</P>
      <P>Will he allow for interim or provisional payments and for the age deterioration question, which has arisen recently and was an issue in the Hanley case?</P>

      <P>The question of future loss of hearing will be debated in the context of the Supreme Court case. I await the outcome with interest. The main thrust of the appeal is on the level of quantum. I am anxious to establish a compensation board or tribunal which reflects the interest necessary to solve this problem once and for all and I will consider its composition.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated publicly that I am anxious to solve cases that come forward on an interim basis as best I can. There are already letters and telephone calls to my Department from people indicating their interest to try and have their cases solved in a non-judicial way. I look forward to seeing in what way an interim arrangement can do that.</P>

      <Quest>if he proposes to proceed with the reduction in numbers of personnel in the Air Corps to 930 all ranks, the transfer of personnel from Gormanston to Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, and the move of Air Corps headquarters from its present location in Park House to Baldonnel, without at the same time making arrangements for the modernisation of the aircraft fleet as recommended in the Price Waterhouse review.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5139/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process has been set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. The reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service must be seen in the broader context of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces generally. The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan made specific provision for the special studies of the Air Corps and the Naval Service on the basis that the initial Price Waterhouse review had necessarily concentrated on the Army. Price Waterhouse's 1998 report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service sets out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations can be proceeded with fairly quickly while others will take longer.</P>
      <P>As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the on-going development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and those of the taxpayer. There is no question of being selective in a negative way with regard to the recommendations. It is, however, important that implementation of the recommendations is undertaken in a planned way having regard to the development of the Defence Forces as a whole. This is why I have asked the Chief of Staff in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
      <P>In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked for a submission from the Chief of Staff to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State which would form the basis of the longer term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service and which will be supported by the on-going effectiveness and efficiency measures. I understand a considerable amount of work has been done and I expect to receive draft proposals for my consideration in the near future. These proposals will include, <i>inter alia,</i> organisation, personnel, headquarters and options in relation to future equipment for both services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also emphasised the importance of involving all of the relevant stakeholders in the process. I have, therefore, established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State air and sea services. The consultation group, <Col N="310" /> which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The group has held one meeting at which I invited the stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this. The group will meet again as the planning and implementation process develops. In addition, arrangements are in hand to ensure the Defence Forces Representative Associations are kept informed of on-going developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to postpone any decision on investment in the Air Corps fleet until the after the White Paper has been published or does he intend to take more immediate decisions on investment? Is he aware of the current state of the fleet? The fouga magisters go out of service completely next May and the alouettes are 36 years old while the rest of the fleet is more than 20 years old.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps is in crisis as far as the fleet is concerned. What are the Minster's plans to address this? He appointed himself chair of the Price Waterhouse implementation group. The Price Waterhouse report said urgent investment in the Air Corps fleet was required. What are his plans in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be said I inherited a couple of problems from the past. While there was very little investment in these areas by previous Administrations, there is now much investment in the Defence Forces generally. It tends to be allocated to different areas at different times. Recently there has been a concentration of large investments on infrastructure, accommodation and equipment because too many installations were providing very poor accommodation and we were very deficient in equipment. In tandem with that there was a major investment in buying the new ship for the Navy while there was a significant earlier investment of £44 million in the Air Corps for the acquisition of the CASA aircraft, etc.</P>
      <P>While there has been significant investment in the infrastructure and general equipment, there are outstanding problems which we will look at in the context of the implementation plan. I understand a draft is virtually ready to be presented to me on foot of a proposal I made to the Chief of Staff and from him to the flying officer in the Navy and the commanding officer in Casement Aerodrome. As soon as I have those proposals I will be in a better position to see to what extent we can meet that demand.</P>
      <P>Additional resources will be available on foot of the voluntary early retirement scheme. We can look to positive developments regarding infrastructure and equipment for the future. I do not wish to go further at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend that the next budget will allow for extra investment in the Air Corps? Does he accept that many of the morale problems in the Air Corps, including the difficulty in recruiting and keeping pilots are, in part, due to this lack of investment in modern fleet which in turn limits the work the Air Corps can do, for example, in search and rescue? Does he also accept that morale would be much better and recruitment would be easier if these issues were addressed and that a detailed plan for a replacement of the Air Corps fleet is a key demand if it is to operate efficiently and effectively in the coming months and years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of morale I have met members of the Defence Forces at all ranks. They are very spirited. While there are problems, I do not believe morale is low. Contracts amounting to £3.4 million were completed at Casement Aerodrome since 1996. Projects amounting to £1.5 million are in progress at present and there are projects in the pipeline to begin a £5 million investment in 1999.</P>
      <P>The people in Casement Aerodrome see significant investment and developments and improvements all the time. There is no room for complaints regarding the lack of investment. The people there are getting on with their business. Outstanding problems will be resolved. There have been unprecedented developments with the accommodation, facilities and hangars. If morale is low now it must have been hopeless when the previous Government was in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to move planes around to keep them from the rain which leaks through hangar four. The Minister must not have visited the aerodrome recently. The conditions are bad in many areas and investment is required.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not be dismissive about the problems. If he wants to preside over a viable Air Corps, investment in a modern fleet is required and working conditions need to be improved. When does he propose to move the headquarters and the Gormanston staff to Baldonnel? Is he satisfied that conditions there will allow for such movement in the short-term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Casement Aerodrome was a key recommendation of the Price Waterhouse report. It is good management to ensure that is effected. It is an indication of my commitment to the ongoing process of reform and development that I will continue to take decisions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy accused me last year of doing nothing until the White Paper process was developed. When I prove I am taking action along the line she accuses me of taking action too early. She cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is right that we need to continually improve the accommodation at all levels and we are doing that with substantial investment. As <Col N="312" /> regards the accommodation being ready for the transfer from headquarters and from Gormanston, which is ongoing and should have taken place before now, there will be teething problems in getting that right. However, just as the Army responded to the improvement of accommodation for those members who needed it after the closure of barracks last year, I expect the same positive response from the Air Corps in Baldonnel. If the Deputy visits the Curragh in Kildare, she will meet all the soldiers who moved there and who are delighted with the way things have been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that I responded to a military proposal. In my discussions with the School of Music and with individual members of the bands there was an air of uncertainty because the Price Waterhouse review and the implementation plan reduced the numbers to 136 which most of the people in that business thought was not sufficient to maintain four bands. From my point of view as well as the <Col N="313" /> advice I received, it was a practical way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Last year we began the process of trying to ensure that some of the recruits who had an interest in this area could be drafted across to do their training and to fill some of the gaps which had emerged. We will continue to do that as much as we can in the course of this amalgamation process and also to increase the numbers both in the band of the Southern Command and the band of the Western Command.</P>

      <P>Following the appearance of the Secretary General of the Department at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, there seems to be confusion about the Army bands playing at certain locations outside Army venues because facilities were not suitable due to sound difficulties.

      <P>The Army bands are hugely popular. The last statistic I saw showed that 708 performances were given throughout the country. People, including the Deputy, constantly contact me to know if the Army band can play in a certain place. I do not know what the facilities are like in different places but we must be careful to ensure that the conditions in the places to which the Army band is invited are suitable. We like to co-operate with the public as much as possible.

      <P>Had the decision to reduce the number of bands from four to three anything to do with the number of members of those bands who had submitted claims for compensation? If the Minister's answer is no, is it not regrettable that his decision was made at the time this information emerged? </P>

We would like to look at places of disadvantage and other areas where we expect no money to cover the costs. Invitations are not accepted on the basis of financial costs, although we must have regard for them because it costs a significant amount to keep Army bands.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 165, 174 and 231 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was the subject of a Private Members' motion and debate on 28 January 1999, culminating in the passing by the House of a Government resolution undertaking favourably to examine further Ireland's participation in PfP taking into account the ongoing public debate. In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a reply to a parliamentary question on 17 February <Col N="315" /> 1999, gave an undertaking that any decision by the Government in favour of Ireland's participation in PfP would make clear the nature and scope of such participation and would be submitted to this House for its approval.</P>
    <P>As regards implications for the Defence Forces of a decision to participate in PfP, I envisage that any possible future role for the Defence Forces would be in the area of peacekeeping and humanitarian and rescue tasks. Participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. In addition, individual states decide on the scope and extent of their participation in PfP activities and in this regard agree individual partnership programmes covering the activities to which they wish to subscribe.</P>
    <P>Should we decide at any time in the future to participate in PfP, it is envisaged that selected activities would include peacekeeping under a UN mandate and humanitarian and rescue tasks, etc. These are activities in line with our traditional involvement and experience in these areas. Since there has been no decision to participate in PfP, and in view of the nature of any envisaged participation by the Defence Forces, the question of preparations or special training for the Defence Forces does not arise at this juncture.</P>
    <P>During the aforementioned debate in the House, Deputies will recall that the Taoiseach stated he would envisage Ireland joining Partnership for Peace on a mutually agreed basis in the second half of this year and that the Government would work towards that timetable. The Taoiseach sees the current debate on PfP as allowing an opportunity to the different parties in Dáil Éireann to formulate their positions and to put them before the people as part of the European election platforms.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also indicated that it is not the Government's intention that joining PfP would result in a change in the real level of Defence spending. It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations with which they are tasked from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that no specific preparations have been put in place in relation to our proposed entry into Partnership for Peace. I find that extraordinary considering that the Taoiseach indicated we would apply to join in the second half of the year. I am aware the Department is receiving submissions on the White Paper and that the Defence Forces are being reorganised. Will the Minister agree it would be prudent to examine how that reorganisation may be affected by our entry into Partnership for Peace? Given that there is a shortage of volunteers for overseas duty, has the Minister considered establishing a type of peace corps whose personnel could be used for overseas missions? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to Deputy Timmins during the last Question Time that I would examine the question of having an emergency team ready, and I am in the process of doing that. We do not have a problem with meeting our requirements to the UN. There was a problem in the past but the Government policy of constant recruitment has removed it. We have a reserve list of people wanting to go overseas but there is insufficient space for them to go to the UN at the present time. Deputy Timmins is correct that a certain amount of planning and preparation has to go into this matter because there is a long lead-in, as he will know from his own experience, to getting people ready for various kinds of actions. We must first await a decision. There is no point in trying to have a normal open discussion about something before decisions are taken but the better equipment the Defence Forces are getting, the armoured personnel carriers, the constant recruitment and all of the developments taking place to enhance the Defence Forces in terms of its reorganisation prepare us for the many challenges we will face. One of the reasons for that reorganisation is to prepare for future demands that might be made on us. It is not true to say preparation is not being made for the different demands that will arise in the future.</P>

      <P>I have been given to understand that a small number of personnel were in training for a joint American-British exercise in the USA which I believe commenced on 14 February. Unfortunately, these personnel did not travel on the exercise. Will the Minister throw some light on that? Will he agree it would have been useful to the advancement of training in the Army if these personnel had been permitted to take part in such an exercise? Will the Minister indicate if the Department of Foreign Affairs blocked this project and, if so, why? </P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Post-traumatic stress disorder is part of this question in terms of the potential for claims arising in the Defence Forces. How does the Minister envisage compensation claims on this and other issues will be dealt with in the Defence Forces at a future date? Does the Minister have any plans to reform the Pensions Board or set up some scheme so that cases, other than the deafness cases, do not continually come before the courts? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we will grow in experience in the context of the non-judicial system we are preparing for hearing claims and these types of cases. That experience should help us decide whether thought should be given in the long-term to the way all these cases can be combined in a more sophisticated, less expensive and non-legal type system. There are approximately 21 claims for post-traumatic stress but only one has been dealt with by the courts and that is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court. I hope we will not see an escalation in these type of claims but I appreciate it would be wise to give wider consideration to alternative systems, and the experience we gain now could be invaluable in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 71, 96, 99, 106, 110, 175, 179, 180, 182, 184 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>The wideranging set of recommendations which emerged from the Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps completed last year included two relating to the relocation of components of the corps. Specifically these were that the Air Corps Headquarters should be relocated to Casement Aerodrome and that the Air Support Squadron should be transferred there from Gormanston. It is my intention that both those recommendations will be acted on as soon as possible as part of the plan to implement the review group's findings.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in the House, the Government considered the Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service last year. To deal with all of the issues raised in the review, a detailed planning process was initiated to give effect to the Government's decision. The Chief of Staff has been asked, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, to submit detailed implementation plans for my consideration to put in place the necessary effectiveness and efficiency measures in their respective areas. The proposed implementation plan will address the relocation aspects along with all the other detailed operational and developmental recommendations as part of a comprehensive plan for a more effective Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that satisfactory accommodation will have to be provided for personnel incoming to Casement Aerodrome and an assessment of existing facilities and additional requirements there will be undertaken by the military authorities in that context. Where the upgrading of facilities or provision of new premises is found to be necessary, appropriate action will be taken to <Col N="320" /> have the work carried out as quickly as possible in the light of competing demands and financial resources available. I am confident the challenge of completing the moves to Casement will be met by the Air Corps with the same degree of determination and efficiency demonstrated by their Army colleagues in the equally formidable task of relocating troops from the barracks which closed last year and that the outcome will be similarly successful.</P>
    <P>I reject the implication in some of the questions that overall there is a poor standard of accommodation for personnel stationed at the Aerodrome or that it has an adverse effect on personnel numbers. In recent years substantial expenditure &ndash; almost £3.5 million &ndash; has been invested in the improvement of infrastructure and facilities there including new mess and accommodation facilities, up-grading of hangars, repairing the gymnasium and new engineering and flight training areas. The thrust to modernise the aerodrome is continuing and provision is made in the 1999 Estimates for further hangar refurbishment and for the commencement of the building of a new hangar, transport workshops and a new operational building for Air Corps and Garda personnel involved in the Garda air support aircraft. The cost of this latter building will be shared by my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>With regard to the helicopter wing building mentioned specifically, the position is that while the building has been regularly maintained it is now showing the signs of deterioration due to its age  &ndash; 17 years. However, as I mentioned, accommodation requirements for personnel at the aerodrome and those due to be relocated there are being examined and will be reported on by the military authorities and the helicopter wing building will be included in that process.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the combined support of the Air Corps and other military personnel involved, the forthcoming implementation plan will become a worthwhile reality and that the corps will be a revitalised, modern organisation with the highest standards of efficiency and effectiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure is that the military authorities as a whole, particularly through their engineering corps, visit the areas, assess what accommodation is required, make proposals for refurbishment or new facilities and come back with a bill. I am only involved when <Col N="321" /> the costs are estimated to see whether we can agree to them. This is a matter of priority and whatever funds are necessary to carry out that refurbishment of facilities will be dedicated immediately towards that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the capital expenditure is a huge drain, particularly when one is dealing with very old facilities. Bearing that in mind, will the Minister agree that if a private company was seeking to colocate in Baldonnel, perhaps it could assist in getting some capital projects off the ground? Has any private company approached the Minister since he took office with a view to setting up a private terminal there?</P>

      <P>His question is quite pertinent. In recent times a number of approaches have been made to me by private consortia as to whether it would be open to them to use some of these facilities. That matter has to be considered. Primarily, my job is to look after the interests and development of the Air Corps. There is a considered view, however, that we have facilities which could be used to our benefit. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, resources which could be obtained in that way would be used to build up the resource in Baldonnel. That matter is being considered.</P>

The outcome of the inquiry will determine if any action needs to be taken in the interests of safety and in this regard I have asked the military authorities to have the court of inquiry reconvened as early as possible and to report to me on any action that may be necessary arising therefrom. Deputies will appreciate that courts of inquiry of this nature are intensive and wide ranging and can take some considerable time to bring to completion.</P>
      <P>Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar is continuing, but live firing for training purposes has ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations. Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during that exercise. These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing. They include safety precautions and misfire drills.</P>

Accepting that it was a very technical exercise to undertake, I am still at a slight loss to know why it should have taken this amount of time. I would appreciate the Deputy's forbearance for a little while longer until the court of inquiry is reconvened and we will see what emerges from that.</P>

      <P>To date 40 claims for hearing loss have been received from serving members of the school of music and 57 such claims have been received from former members. Despite this high number of claims from serving and former members of the school of music, there are no proposals at present to reduce the overall numbers of musicians in the school.</P>
      <P>Recently I approved a proposal from the military authorities that the military band at the Curragh should be amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Command, the Army No. 1 Band. The amalgamation of these two bands does not involve any reduction in the overall numbers of musicians within the school of music as already provided for within the Defence Forces review implementation plan approved by the previous Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Late last year I announced the result of the first stage of a competition to provide armoured personnel carriers for the Defence Forces. More than 30 prospective suppliers worldwide had expressed interest in the procurement programme and proposals were received from 12 companies. The proposals were evaluated and assessed by a civilian-military project <Col N="324" /> team which was established to manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.</P>
      <P>Two vehicles have now been selected to go forward to the final stage of the competition having complied fully with the initial technical specification. The successful proposals were submitted by Mowag of Switzerland, who manufacture the Piranha APC, and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria, who manufacture the Pandur APC. Last week these two suppliers were asked to prepare formal tenders on the basis of a more detailed specification. Completed tenders have to be returned to my Department by 19 March and they will be evaluated to determine technical merit and the best economic advantage to the Department. The evaluation process will also include trials in Ireland of both vehicles by the Defence Forces. The trials will commence in April and are expected to last for about two months. The aim of the trials is to assess from a technical and user perspective the suitability of the vehicles.</P>
      <P>I expect that a contract will be in place later this year for the supply of up to 40 APCs over five years. A delivery schedule will become clearer when the tender documentation is returned but I would not expect the first APCs to be delivered until next year.</P>
      <P>The purchase of modern APCs is regarded by the Defence Forces as the most urgent equipment requirement to enable them carry out all the roles assigned by Government. One of the priorities in An Action Programme for the Millennium is to &ldquo;equip the Defence Forces adequately for an expanded role in international peacekeeping&rdquo;. The procurement of APCs forms an integral part of an ongoing re-equipment programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 105, 197 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were evacuated. In addition to those initial meetings, I met with Members of the Oireachtas and local councillors in relation to Castleblayney Barracks on 3 February 1999, as well as local councillors and officials from Naas Urban District Council on the same date in relation to Devoy Barracks, Naas. My officials met with councillors and officials of Kildare County Council on 11 February 1999 in relation to Magee Barracks, Kildare. Discussions also took place between my officials and officials of Cork County Council on 2 December 1998 in relation to Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. Further meetings and consultations will take place as and when required.</P>
      <P>Two of the barrack properties, Castleblayney and Fermoy, have already been offered for sale by public tender. The closing date for receipt of tenders was Friday, 19 February 1999 and the tenders are currently being examined. Magee Barracks, Kildare, Devoy Barracks, Naas and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, will be placed on the market as soon as is practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Ballincollig, the largest of the properties concerned, tenders have been sought from independent planning consultants for the preparation of an integrated area action plan for <Col N="326" /> the future development of the property. An integral part of that plan will be to undertake a comprehensive public consultation process with all relevant community interests in the Ballincollig area.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to evacuate Clancy Barracks in the short-term, but it will be disposed of following the transfer of the storage facilities, which are located there, to the Curragh Camp.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the sale of the properties will realise the financial potential originally estimated. The cost of providing security to date at all the barracks evacuated by the Defence Forces amounts to £238,817.10 inclusive of VAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister met officials of Naas UDC and the area community of Kildare County Council. How does he envisage 15 per cent of these lands will be donated for community purposes? Will that be agreed in consultation with Naas UDC and Kildare County Council? Will he take account of the views of the chambers of commerce and development associations as to how best to devise a plan for integrating these lands for community purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to ensure there is broad consultation between the local community and the Department. It seems the purposes for which they will be used will vary. In the case of Devoy Barracks in Naas, there is a strong, though not conclusive view, that some lands might be dedicated for education or other purposes. That will be taken into account as part of the arrangement I will make concerning 15 per cent of that land that will be donated for community purposes. In other areas the local authorities put forward proposals for the use of these lands. Chambers of commerce, disadvantaged groups and others have put forward other proposals. I will take all these proposals into consideration and ensure we provide for the proper long-term development for the towns involved. It seems the purposes for which the land will be used will vary in each case. I am open to suggestions in this regard. I do not want to appear to be a dictator. It is important to secure consensus at local level. These army barracks were part of the anatomy of these local communities for a long time and we want to come up with the best solution for this part of the exercise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">

      <P>While lands at Devoy Barracks in Naas are zoned for educational purposes, if negotiations on the purpose for which those lands will be used go to the wire, will they remain zoned for that purpose? Is another avenue open concerning the sale of Devoy Barracks or will the Minister have to negotiate with Naas UDC regarding the zoning of that site?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is slightly outside the remit of the questions before us, but the Minister is in a generous mood. In view of the housing crisis and that the Department of Defence has a good deal of land in desirable locations, has he had discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about the possibility of giving small parcels of land to local authorities in areas other than those where barracks have been closed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is helpful when the Opposition supports the disposal of properties held by the Defence Forces. Deputy Timmins's point is helpful. A portfolio of all the properties concerned is being prepared. I wish to assist local authorities where we have lands that would be suitable and we are undertaking to proceed as far as we can in that regard. There are some options available.</P>
      <P>We hope to conclude discussions with Naas UDC on an arrangement acceptable to both sides and that would facilitate the timespan for rezoning, which is a few weeks hence. If we cannot conclude those negotiations, councils have certain powers they could exercise, but I am optimistic we will conclude them.</P>
      <P>Tenders were submitted for two properties and I am delighted to tell the House that they are above the estimated value of the properties. The timescale for the submission of the other three tenders is the end of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> The delay in holding inquests is an ongoing cause of concern for people who are already traumatised by the sudden death of a loved one. It is indefensible that a post-mortem held on 1 November 1998 has not produced the relevant details to enable a death certificate to be issued by a medical practitioner or an inquest to be held in which case the death certificate would also be made available.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in reply to a question tabled yesterday that the Registrar General for Births, Deaths and Marriages is responsible for this matter and he was awaiting results from the histopathology department of Waterford Regional Hospital, which is under the authority of the South Eastern Health Board. It is dependent on a chain of events; however, it is immaterial who is responsible for the delay when a family is awaiting details in order to get a death certificate. I suggest that short-term regulations be introduced in order that results are sent out. It is appalling that the results of a post-mortem carried out four and a half months ago have not been furnished. If the relevant departments are under-staffed they should get additional temporary staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister has replied to me by letter indicating that interviews for a consultant histopathologist had been held recently. There should not be such a long delay. People suffer enough when a death occurs in the family. They cannot deal with the deceased's finances and other legal matters until they have the death certificate. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has invited submissions on the review of the role of coroner but coroners cannot do very much if the results of post-mortems are held up in the laboratories.</P>
    <P>In this specific case will the Minister ensure that the results are sent out speedily in order to alleviate this family's sufferings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure for the registration of deaths is set out in the Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts, 1863 to 1996. Section 30 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1863, and section 14 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1880, require registrars of births and deaths appointed under section 23 of that Act to inform themselves of every death which shall happen in his-her district subject to the regulations made under those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1880, imposes a duty on <Col N="330" /> specified persons to act as informant in relation to a death which occurs in a house or hospital. These qualified informants include the nearest relative present at death and the occupier of a house in which the death occurred. The term occupier is further defined in section 38 of that Act to include the governor, master, matron or other chief resident officer of a public institution, including a workhouse, hospital and any prescribed public, religious or charitable institution.</P>
    <P>A death may be registered on production of a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a medical practitioner, as provided by section 20 of the Act of 1880, and the qualified informant discharges his-her duty by attending personally at the office of the registrar to give the information necessary for the registration of the death and signing the register as informant. The entry is completed by the signature of the registrar.</P>

      <P>My office is open all the time and the Deputy may come and see me about any matter at any time. Section 18 provides for inquiry by the coroner, where a medical certificate of cause of death is not available and where a person had not been seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before death. Section 19 of the Coroner's Act provides that a coroner may cause a post-mortem examination to be carried out on the body of a deceased person to determine if an inquest is required.</P>
      <P>Where a coroner holds an inquest, adjourns an inquest at which evidence of identification and medical evidence as to the cause of death has been given or where as a result of a post-mortem examination the coroner decides that an inquest is not required he or she is required, by section 50 of the Act of 1962, to furnish a certificate to the registrar of births and deaths containing the details necessary for the registration of the death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the case the Deputy raises, as I <Col N="331" /> explained in my reply to him yesterday, the registration of this death is primarily a matter for An tArd Chláraitheoir. I understand that a post-mortem examination was carried out in respect of the death referred to by the Deputy but that the report of the post-mortem cannot be finalised until the results of tests have been furnished by the histopathology department of Waterford Regional Hospital. The provision of services in the histopathology department at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance and the board is committed to the continued development of these services in consultation with my Department. As indicated in the reply, the South Eastern Health Board recently held interviews for the appointment of a fourth consultant histopathologist for the region, which should improve these services and significantly reduce delays.</P>
    <P>When the report of the above-mentioned post-mortem becomes available, it will have to be decided if the death should be referred to the coroner or, alternatively, if the death should be registered on the signature of a qualified informant and on the production of a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a medical practitioner. If the death is referred to the coroner, the registrar must await the issue of a coroner's certificate before registering the death.</P>
    <P>I take the point the Deputy makes on the delay in furnishing those results and I have asked the South Eastern Health Board to deal with it so that it can be referred to the coroner as has been suggested or a death certificate can issue on foot of conditions as set out in the reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Killian's senior national school in Kingswood in my constituency has been seeking provision of a general purposes room and ancillary accommodation since 1986. Successive Governments have neglected to respond to this genuine need, if the school's curriculum is to be professionally applied. We are not talking about an optional extra but a necessary basic facility.</P>
      <P>My figures for St. Killian's, subject to correction, suggest an enrolment of 429 pupils in September 1998. This is a large school in a growing community where additional housing is ongoing with more families at the family formation stage. Yet all applications for physical education, library, medical and other basic facilities have been refused. Surely traditional explanations relating to constraints on the capital budget do not apply in the context of current public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recently I raised this issue with the Minister for Education and Science on 9 February 1999 when the Minister explained that &ldquo;general <Col N="332" /> purpose rooms were excluded and priority had to be given to the provision of essential classroom accommodation&rdquo;. He was not, however, &ldquo;in a position to give a commitment in respect of a major project in the school&rdquo;. This is profoundly disappointing, given the scale of the need.</P>
    <P>Further, I am puzzled by the official response to the most recent application from the school which I am informed was to the effect that the application for a general purpose area would be considered if the school sought classrooms also. I am not sure of the implications of the statement. It seems that if the school is not pressing for extra classrooms but is desperately seeking a general purposes room, it makes good sense to respond to the request being made. The children in this school, their parents and staff have functioned for 13 years with nothing but classrooms. Surely the time has come, especially in times of propitious public finances, to redress the situation and permit the provision of an appropriate general purposes area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to put on record the completely inadequate education facilities that currently exist in St. Killian's senior school, Kingswood, Tallaght. The Minister should be well aware of the needs of this school given the constant barrage of representations his office has received from all public representatives in Dublin South-West.</P>
      <P>St. Killian's is typical of many schools that were built during a time of limited financial resources. By any standard, it is time for the Department of Education and Science to provide adequate funding to allow the school provide the basic facilities that are not in place at present.</P>
      <P>The school applied on 19 November last year for specific capital works to take place. This latest application for funding followed countless attempts down the years by the board of management of St. Killian's to improve its education environment. To date, the continuous applications for funding to the Department have, unfortunately, fallen on deaf ears. The school is regularly informed that other priority projects within the Department must take precedence over its needs.</P>
      <P>Following the Minister's recent announcement concerning substantially increased funding for capital projects, the time is right to improve the facilities at St. Killian's senior school. This debate gives me, Deputy Rabbitte and my colleagues the opportunity to highlight to the Minister and the Department the chronic conditions under which teachers must work in this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a school the size of St. Killian's it is disgraceful that no general purpose area exists within the confines of the school. It would be unimaginable to design a modern school without the provision of such an area. Without this facility, St. Killian's can only provide PE on an irregular and infrequent basis. It is not good enough that open space grass areas around the school provide the only opportunity for children <Col N="333" /> to play or engage in PE. It is also worth highlighting that other on-site activities associated with a normal school, such as drama lessons, parent teacher meetings, school concerts and religious services, cannot take place due to the lack of a general purpose area.</P>
    <P>In the school's recent application to the Department, the board of management highlighted the lack of staff toilet facilities in the school. Indeed, I was astonished to discover when I visited the school recently that toilets for disabled, wheelchair bound persons were not there. I would have considered it normal in the context of a modern school that a good remedial teaching room would exist to help children with learning difficulties. The relevant room at St. Killian's has been described by the board of management as &ldquo;a closet facility&rdquo;. Equally, there is not a facility or room for visiting teachers to provide children with specialist skills and knowledge. It is also unacceptable that the school does not have a library or a facility to encourage parents to engage in the life of the school through the provision of a parents' room.</P>
    <P>These facilities are essential ingredients in the efficient provision of modern education. The deficiencies at St. Killian's relate to the fact that the school was built during difficult financial times. The board of management, staff and pupils are not looking for an educational environment above the facilities that exist in other schools. They simply seek basic minimum improvements for their school.</P>
    <P>It is now opportune to concentrate on the provision of facilities and services in education which mirror our belief in the primacy of education for the future success of the country. This school needs the financial support of the Department to allow it to improve its facilities for its pupils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter. It affords me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of additional accommodation at St. Killian's senior school at Kingswood.</P>
      <P>This school was built in 1987 with ten classrooms. A three classroom extension was built in 1989 and a further two classrooms were added in 1991. The school currently has a staffing of a principal, 13 assistant teachers and a remedial teacher. The enrolment was 411 pupils in September 1998. Management of the school has recently renewed its application for grant assistance for the provision of a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school was built in the late 1980s and was provided with the standard facilities at that time. However, due to the severe financial difficulties during that period, general purpose rooms were excluded and priority had to be given to the provision of essential classroom accommodation. The Department is currently re-examining the accommodation requirements of St. Killian's school in light of the recent application. When <Col N="334" /> this work has been completed, the Department will be in further contact with the school management.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a need to provide the most modern facilities possible in all schools. Within the exigencies of the Department's budget we do our best to ensure that will happen, as all Governments have done. The education ethos in this country is extremely strong. To ensure that we minimise expenditure on professional fees and so forth with regard to design matters, the Department likes to ensure that when it provides facilities it will provide more than one per school. For that reason, stand alone additions such as a single room are seldom encouraged or supported. Given that other accommodation is required at this school, the Deputies can be assured that the Department will give its utmost attention to resolving the matter as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the huge contribution by the ISPCC and its predecessor the NSPCC to supporting families, particularly children. Despite its present difficulties, I am confident the organisation's good work will continue.</P>
      <P>This matter relates to files on people who were placed in industrial schools. A recent report suggested that the files might have been destroyed. When adults who had been placed in industrial schools made inquiries about their details they were told the files had been destroyed. However, it emerged since then that files were referred to the ISPCC as late as the 1980s. That appears to contradict the original information given to these people.</P>
      <P>This is an issue on which I have laboured long and hard. I have serious concern about records not being collected and collated and kept in a proper manner. I have raised this issue before in the context of adoption agencies and their files. There is a concern that since, in many instances, the religious orders and adoption agencies concerned no longer exist, their files are likely to be destroyed. I have called on this and previous Ministers to ensure that records of this nature are collated and kept in a secure place.</P>
      <P>The last time this issue arose and received a great deal of attention was when archival material was found in the Department of Foreign Affairs &ndash; Deputy Spring was the then Minister and Tánaiste &ndash; relating to children who had been adopted in the United States. At the time an indication was given that the records would be collated as a matter of urgency and access to them would be made available. However, access is another issue which cannot be resolved today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that people who seek information regarding their family of origin, birth details or even basic health information should know that such details are available. My concern, which is shared by many, is that for as long as the keeping of these records is dispersed among institutions and organisations such as the ISPCC, <Col N="335" /> adoption societies, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Education and Science there is a possibility they could be destroyed. It has been reported to me that in certain cases, fires have caused the destruction of records which cannot be replaced.</P>
    <P>I thought this issue came within the remit of the Department of Health and Children but it has been referred to the Department of Education and Science. There is an urgent need for a single Minister to take on the task of collating the information and records which are held by these disparate bodies and I urge that this be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the media report to which the Deputy refers. The report in question suggested that files of the ISPCC, and its predecessor the NSPCC, relating to those organisations' involvement in having children placed in the old industrial schools may have been destroyed. The files in question belong to the ISPCC and its predecessor, the NSPCC. However, I share the Deputy's concern that any files, regardless of ownership, which could be of benefit to former pupils of the industrial schools in gaining knowledge about their childhood should not be destroyed but should be retained for such use.</P>
      <P>My Department has a range of records and files relating to existing and former industrial and reformatory schools. In some instances the information dates back to the last century. The level of information available varies considerably between schools. Overall, the records contain data relating to more than 36,000 children who were placed in these schools over the years. Some of the entries are incomplete and generally the information is not very detailed. The records available include some 10,000 files on individual children. The level of detail in these files can vary significantly; in some instances the information is very limited. In other cases, however, significant detail is given regarding the circumstances of the child's placement in the school and subsequent developments in relation to the child.</P>
      <P>Files also exist in relation to the original arrangements surrounding the establishment of some of the reformatory and industrial schools and also their general administration, funding and inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial and reformatory schools were originally certified under the provisions of the Children Act, 1908. The number of industrial schools in the State varied from a maximum of 51 in the <Col N="336" /> 1940s to just 25 in 1984. Among the recommendations in the Kennedy report of 1970 was one that responsibility for children in care who were not offenders should be transferred to the Department of Health. Departmental and ministerial responsibility for 23 of the remaining 25 industrial schools &ndash; known as group homes &ndash; was transferred to the Department of Health's child care division on 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>The number of children accommodated in the industrial schools ranged from 6,378 in 1949 to 796 in 1984. Prior to 1984, the great majority of children referred to industrial schools were placed there as a result of what was described as &ldquo;lack of proper guardianship&rdquo;. The Department's records show that evidence in relation to lack of proper guardianship was generally given to the courts by an inspector of the ISPCC, or its predecessor the NSPCC. Only about 10 per cent of the children were referred to the schools on foot of indictable offences.</P>
    <P>In 1997, my Department engaged professional archivists to conduct a detailed examination of all the files, records and registers relating to the industrial and reformatory schools in my Department's possession. The completion of the archivists' work during 1998 resulted in the creation of a database of all records in my Department's possession. This database is utilised within my Department to facilitate searches of old records on foot of inquiries such as those from former pupils of the old industrial and reformatory schools.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the extremely sensitive nature of much of the data involved in this area and that access to such data is strictly controlled. My Department is in consultation with the National Archives Office regarding the question of future access to these records.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns expressed about the possible destruction of some records of the ISPCC in this area, I have asked my officials, together with the National Archives Office, to establish the exact status of the records in question. It is important that where such records exist, they should be preserved and maintained for the benefit of the individuals to whom they relate and also to facilitate research and study of this aspect of our social history.</P>
    <P>In view of the long interest Deputy McGennis has shown in the area of records, particularly those relating to social history, I will communicate with her as soon as the relevant <i>de facto</i> information comes to hand.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 March 1999.</P>

      <P>The date for the introduction of euro notes and coins was decided in 1997 and is contained in Regulation (EC) No. 974/98, which provides for their introduction on 1 January 2002. An amendment to the regulation would be required to change the date and such an amendment would require the unanimity of the 11 member states which have adopted the euro.</P>
      <P>An idea floated by the Belgian Finance Minister to bring forward the date for the introduction of euro notes and coins was informally discussed at the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers in Brussels last month. The European Commission was invited to carry out a final review of the question but the majority of Ministers did not favour changing the date.</P>
      <P>In the discussions leading up to the decision to introduce euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002, Ireland and the Netherlands argued against a date of 1 January, because it is close to Christmas and new year sales are being held. However, no other country supported a date other than 1 January</P>
      <P>I would have been prepared to support an examination of the possibility of a new date now provided it could be shown that a new and earlier date was feasible at this stage in view of the preparations already made on the basis of 1 January 2002 and that unanimous agreement could quickly be reached. However, the majority of the euro member states do not support changing the date and I do not feel, therefore, that there is a realistic prospect that the date will be changed.</P>

    <P>I have, however, as Minister for Finance, represented Ireland at a number of meetings of ECOFIN Ministers, at which Mr. Wim Duisenburg was also present, where views are exchanged on relevant matters.

Under the Treaty on <Col N="338" /> European Union, the president of the ECB is to be invited to Council meetings when matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the European System of Central Banks are discussed. In addition to these Treaty provisions, the ECB's president may also be invited to take part, when appropriate, at the informal meetings of the Euro 11 Group which is comprised of economic and finance ministers of member states participating in the single currency.</P>
    <P>While the ECB is independent in setting monetary policy, it is, nevertheless, important that opportunities exist for a continuous and fruitful dialogue between the Council and the ECB, as set out in the Treaty, for the effective implementation of European economic policy.</P>
    <P>Apart from these arrangements, the Treaty provides that the Council may formulate 'general orientations' for exchange rate policy in relation to the euro, without prejudice to the ECB's primary objective to maintain price stability. The EU Economics and Finance Ministers agreed at the meeting of ECOFIN in December 1997 that such general orientations should be given only in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in answering this question it might be instructive to trace the genesis of the relief.</P>
      <P>The original representations in this matter dated from February 1993. On that occasion the Irish Georgian Society wrote to the Minister saying that the society had been recently approached by a number of members who were deeply concerned by what they believed was a new proposal by the Revenue Commissioners to tax art collections in this country in certain circumstances. The society pointed out that many of their members allowed the public to visit their historic houses, to view, study and enjoy the buildings and art collections. This access was recognised in the provisions of section 19 of the 1982 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>The society proposed a tax relief for such collections on view to the public in such &ldquo;section 19&rdquo; houses, in order to retain important collections in the State for the enjoyment of the Irish people and in the interest of preserving the national heritage.</P>
      <P>Around the same time, the Department of Arts, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht wrote supporting the case and referring in particular to the case of one named individual. The individual concerned also wrote to the Minister in October 1993 seeking an amendment to the Finance Acts indicating that such a change would be doing a great service to Irish heritage and that there was a danger of persons moving works of art out of the country for sale. In January 1994, representations were forwarded by the Department of the Taoiseach from Bord Failte supporting the proposed change to the Finance Acts.</P>
      <P>Having examined the matter and the representations received, the Minister decided that a suitable provision would be included in the Finance Bill to deal with such circumstances.</P>
      <P>This provision was enacted as section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994, with the support of both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>While the application of tax law is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that one taxpayer has applied for and benefited from the section since its introduction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 Finance Bill published on 11 February 1999, I have provided for a continuation of this relief for a further year to 5 April 2000. While I am aware that concern has been expressed by the film sector regarding the proposed one year extension to the relief in question, speculation that this extension puts the future continuation of the relief into question is not justified. This extension will enable the Government to fully consider the contents of a number of reports on the film sector that are to be published shortly. Rolling the reliefs forward does not mean the end of film relief. It is a valuable incentive to film making here and is recognised as such by the Government. We want the relief to continue to work to secure the Government's aims for the industry and the publication of the special reports on the industry by the Government and their subsequent detailed consideration is the best way to address the appropriate policies for State support in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17, 36 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission was notified separately of both of the schemes mentioned by the Deputies. The pilot rural renewal scheme was notified to the Commission on 17 September 1998 while the proposed extension to end-December 1999 of the tax reliefs for the Custom House Docks Area was notified to them on 30 January 1998.</P>
      <P>I will not be in a position to introduce the business elements of the rural renewal scheme until EU Commission approval for the scheme is received. The latest position is that the Commission has raised a large number of queries arising from our initial application and a detailed reply is currently being prepared.</P>
      <P>EU Commission approval is not needed for the residential elements of the rural renewal scheme and the reliefs for the rented residential accommodation under the scheme commenced on 1 June 1998. In addition I have made provision in section 41 of the 1999 Finance Bill for the introduction of owner occupier reliefs under the rural renewal scheme for expenditure incurred after 6 April 1999 in the construction, conversion and refurbishment of qualifying residential property.</P>
      <P>I will not be in a position to comment on the introduction of double rent allowance for the rural renewal scheme until EU approval for the scheme is received. However, I have made provision for the availability of 100 per cent instead of 50 per cent capital allowances in cases where double rent allowance is no longer available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been raised in the House on a number of previous occasions. I do not accept that the residual element of vehicle registration tax, VRT, is depriving car owners and garages of the benefits of the Single Market; nor do I sub<Col N="343" /> scribe to the view that the residual element of VRT is the sole reason why Irish used cars are not sold in other European countries. For obvious reasons, the principal outlet for such vehicles would be the UK where I believe there may be a number of factors which affect the export from this country of such second hand cars.</P>
    <P>These may include the relative range and choice of second hand cars in the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> those available in the United Kingdom, where there is a higher ratio of car ownership as well as higher car fleet ownership. The fact that the UK has had for many years an &ldquo;MOT test&rdquo; may also mitigate against imports into that country from the State. This position may alter following the introduction here of car testing from the beginning of the year 2000, which was recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>VRT is paid on a once-off basis at the time of registration of a vehicle; there is no legal provision of repaying a proportion of this tax when a used car is removed from the State; nor is it incumbent on the authorities here to do so in the Single Market. This tax is a valuable source of Exchequer funding which yielded £486 million in 1998. It would not be appropriate for me to introduce a facility which would subsidise the export of used cars from the State, if this is what the Deputies have in mind. There may also be EU Treaty implications of any such export refund scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 19, 23 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Starting with Deputy De Rossa's first question, the Government's approach to the Agenda 2000 negotiations is set out in great detail in the Taoiseach's speech of 22 February last, of which copies will be made available in the Library. I will recapitulate the main points for the benefit of the House. Ireland's basic demands are:</P>
      <P>first, adequate transition terms for those areas no longer eligible for Objective One treatment;</P>
      <P>second, continued eligibility for the Cohesion Fund;</P>
      <P>third, an adequate and equitable outcome in the agriculture area that recognises the vital contribution, unique in EU terms, which the agriculture sector makes towards the national economy.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ireland has proposed that the poorer areas of the country be encompassed in a new region which, in its own right, would qualify for Objective One status. Regionalisation continues to be a fundamental priority from Ireland's point of view and the Government remains fully committed to regionalisation in line with the application submitted to EUROSTAT.</P>
      <P>Turning to Deputy De Rossa's second question, when deciding, last November, to opt for a regionalisation approach for Structural Funds purposes the Government also decided, as the Deputy will be aware, that a revised regional structure would be needed in that context. Details of the new regional structures were announced by the Government in its press release of 9 February. These proposals were drawn up following extensive and positive consultation with representatives of the existing regional authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met with the Irish Assembly of Regional Authorities in January of this year to discuss their submissions on the National Development Plan and the implications of the Government's proposals for regionalisation on regional structures. <Col N="345" /> In addition to my meeting with the Irish Assembly of Regional Authorities, a number of meetings have been held between officials of my Department and regional authority representatives, both before and after the Government's announcement of 9 February of the creation of two new group regional authorities. These meetings were held to discuss the Government's regional structures and the development of regional strategies for the Objective One region and the region in transition.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the Government's decision to regionalise, my Department asked the regional authorities, which will make up the two new NUTS II regions, to develop a regional strategy for each of the new regions for inputting into the NDP. The authorities have been given financial assistance to engage consultants to assist them with this task. A steering committee for each of the NUTS II regions, comprising the chairmen of the existing regional authorities, the regional directors, city and county managers and representatives of the CSF evaluation unit and my Department, has been established to oversee the preparation of the regional strategies. The draft regional strategies will be presented to each of the existing regional authorities for their consideration before finalisation and their submission to my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department will also be engaging in the next two weeks in bilateral meetings with Government Departments to discuss their submissions on the NDP. Among the issues which will be considered at those meetings will be the regionalisation of the Departments' NDP investment proposals.</P>
    <P>Taking up Deputy Ring's question, EUROSTAT recent reply to Ireland regionalisaton application, as I have said earlier, is negative. Despite meetings which have taken place with EUROSTAT and the supply of a great deal of information, it seems to us that EUROSTAT's response is unclear and based on some misapprehension. Clarification is clearly needed as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, a reply by the director general of the CSO addressing the issues raised by EUROSTAT was sent yesterday and an urgent meeting is being sought with EUROSTAT at the highest level to further progress the matter.</P>
    <P>Turning finally to Deputy Bruton's question regarding my Department's role in the formation of the regionalisation proposal, I refer to my reply to questions in the House on 14 October last, in which I gave details of the steps taken by my Department in relation to the regionalisation proposal. As part of the process of preparing the groundwork on this issue, my Department intensively examined and analysed the various implications of any regionalisation approach. This examination-analysis involved formal consultations with all other Government Departments; also involved were official contacts with the Commission and with EUROSTAT. The results of this examination were presented to the Ministers and Secretaries-General Group on EU policy <Col N="346" /> and, with their approval, were later submitted to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>This issue has arisen on a number of previous occasions in the House. I would refer the Deputy to my replies to parliamentary questions on 9 February, 16 February and 23 February 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce a zero, a low or a staggered system of excise duty on beer brewed in small scale breweries. Irish excise duties do not discriminate between large and small breweries and the tax system is not a source of competitive <Col N="347" /> distortion. In addition, the excise duty on beer was last increased in the January 1994 budget. So, in effect, all breweries have been advantaged by a relative decline in the share of its price which is attributed to tax. The share of price represented by total tax, including VAT, has declined from 37.6 per cent in 1994 to 35.6 per cent in 1998.</P>
    <P>Under Article 4.1 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC, member states may apply reduced rates of duty, which may be differentiated in accordance with the annual production of the breweries concerned, to beer brewed by independent small breweries within the following limits:  the reduced rates shall not be applied to undertakings producing more than 200,000 hectolitres of beer per year;  the reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, shall not be set more than 50 per cent below the standard national rate of excise duty.</P>
    <P>I understand that Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands avail of the provisions of Article 4.1 of the Directive.</P>
    <P>Any proposed low or staggered regime would also have to apply to imports of beer produced in small breweries in other member states in accordance with the provisions Article 4.3 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC.</P>
    <P>At present there are 13 micro breweries approved by the Revenue Commissioners. I believe that the overall package of measures announced in my recent budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax, will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the brewing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest position regarding the application of double rent allowance and rates remission in the Custom House Docks Area is that the EU Commission <Col N="348" /> on 9 February 1999 issued a formal letter to the Irish authorities in regard to their decision of 20 January 1999 on the matter. The Commission stated in this letter that they have initiated proceedings against Ireland in respect of the post-31 May 1993 time extensions of the double rent and rates remission reliefs in the area in question without EU Commission approval. The Irish authorities have one month to respond to this formal letter and a response is currently being prepared. The next step in the procedure will involve the Commission publishing the formal letter in the official EU Journal. As occurs in all such cases involving State aid third parties from member states are entitled to send comments to the EU Commission on the matter within one month of the date of the publication of the letter. When this stage of the procedure is complete the Commission will then be in a position to further examine the issue and hopefully make a final decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>My Department has been active in pursuing these issues as constructively as possible with the Commission. We have also held detailed discussions with the interested parties here to keep them fully in the picture. Officials from my Department had a meeting with EU Commission officials in Brussels on 17 February 1999 to progress this case further.</P>

      <P>At present, there is no statutory requirement on banks setting out the steps that they must take to trace the owners of funds in dormant bank accounts. In fact, at present there is no definition in law as to what constitutes a dormant account. It is generally taken to refer to accounts which have been inactive on the part of the holder of the account for a lengthy period of time, but no specific period has been specified. It would be a matter for individual banks to say what steps they take to trace the owners of such accounts. I am advised that auditors send out statements on a random selection of accounts during the course of each audit and that external auditors send out statements to a selection of holders of dormant accounts annually.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to previous parliamentary questions that I have asked my officials to draw up policy proposals to deal with dormant accounts. There are a number of complex legal and constitutional issues which must be addressed in developing such a policy. These relate in particular to property rights.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 261, 268 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>The third stage of Economic and Monetary Union &ndash; EMU &ndash; commenced on 1 January 1999. Ireland was one of 11 European Union member states which adopted the single currency, the euro. The irrevocably fixed conversion rate between the euro and the Irish pound was set at 1 euro = 78.7564 Irish pence.</P>
      <P>Under the Treaty on European Union, the European Central Bank, in carrying out the tasks of the European System of Central Banks, is independent in its setting of monetary policy. This independence, which is explicitly guaranteed by the treaty, is essential for the attainment of the primary objective of the ECB of the maintenance of price stability.</P>
      <P>The treaty also provides that the Council of Ministers may formulate &lsquo;general orientations' for exchange rate policy in relation to the euro, without prejudice to the ESCB's primary objective to maintain price stability. It should be noted, however, that as was agreed by the Ministers for Finance at their ECOFIN meeting in Luxembourg, in December, 1997, such general orientations should only be given in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Prior to the adoption of the euro, as Minister for Finance, I did not comment on the Irish pound exchange rate and I do not now propose to make any comment on the euro exchange rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the implications of changes in the value of sterling, other things being equal, an <Col N="350" /> increase in the value of sterling relative to the euro would lead to an improvement in competitiveness for companies exporting to the UK; some 24 per cent of our exports, or IR£8.5 billion, went to the UK in 1997. This could also lead to higher prices in Ireland as the costs of imports increase; some 34 per cent of our imports, or IR£8.7 billion, were from the UK in 1997.</P>

      <P>The Euro 11 meeting, held on 18 January 1999, was informed by the Presidency of progress to date on the implementation of arrangements for the external representation of the euro as agreed by the European Council meeting in Vienna on 12 and 13 December 1997. There was an initial discussion on the outlook for the euro area economy in 1999 and on the appropriate policy mix. The Commission was to undertake further analyses for the next meeting of Euro 11.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) held on the same day, consisted of the following issues:<i>1. Presidency and Commission Work Programme</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>As is usual at its first meeting under a new Presidency, ECOFIN held a discussion and open debate on the German Presidency's programme for the first six months of the year. President Santer also set out the European Commission's annual work programme for 1999 in the ECOFIN area.</P>
      <P>The German Presidency emphasised employment, EMU, taxation and Agenda 2000 as the key issues for its Presidency. President Santer underlined the fact that the Commission shared these priorities. I joined with delegations in broadly welcoming the Presidency programme, and in particular the strong emphasis it contained on promoting growth and employment and combating unemployment.</P>
      <P>
        <i>2. Implementation of Stage 3 of EMU: Statistical Requirements</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The Council endorsed the report of the Economic and Financial Committee on statistical requirements in stage 3 of EMU which underlined the need for methodologically sound, consistent and timely economic and budgetary statistical data in order to assist in making economic policies mutually consistent under monetary union.</P>
      <P>
        <i>3. Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Stability Programme of Ireland (1999-2001): opinion of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council examined Ireland's stability programme which covers the period 1999-2001. Com<Col N="351" /> missioner de Silguy congratulated Ireland on its excellent performance and noted the very positive fiscal results. The Council considered the macroeconomic projections in the programme to be attainable. The healthy budget outturn of 1998 means that Ireland already fulfils the stability and growth pact objective of a budget balance close to balance or in surplus and is forecast to continue to do so over the period of the programme. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Stability Programme of Austria (1998-2002): Opinion of the Council</P>
    <P>The Council also examined the stability programme of Austria which covers the period 1998-2002. The Council commanded the achievement of significantly better budgetary outcomes than targeted. However, the forecast reduction in the general government deficit is seen to be very modest. While the programme is in line with the provisions of the stability and growth pact, the Council noted that the budgetary strategy adopted by the Austrian Government does not provide for any additional safety margin. The Council encouraged the Austrian Government to execute the 1999 budget plan as rigorously as possible and to do its utmost to overachieve the budgetary targets set in the stability programme. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>4. Agenda 2000:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>ECOFIN briefly considered the progress of Agenda 2000 negotiations, focusing on certain outstanding issues in relation to the Inter-Institutional Agreement. The Presidency programme seeks to achieve an overall agreement at the Berlin European Council on 24-25 March. The Presidency was to undertake further work with a view to moving towards agreement on the &ldquo;negotiating box&rdquo; in accordance with that timetable.</P>
    <P>Ministers discussed the following items over lunch:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Duty Free Sales</i>

      <i>Date for the Introduction of Euro Notes and Coins: E-Day</i>

      <P>The Euro 11 meeting, held on 8 February 1999, had a discussion on the economic outlook in the euro-area for 1999, and on the appropriate policy mix. There was also an initial general discussion on the preparation of the 1999 broad economic policy guidelines, to be adopted by the ECOFIN Council in accordance with Article 103(2) of the Treaty. It was agreed that the Commission will undertake further analysis for the next meeting.</P>
      <P>The Euro 11 meeting also discussed preparations for the G7 meeting on 20 February 1998 in the context of the arrangements for the external representation of the euro as agreed at the Vienna European Council. The meeting was not invited to adopt any agreed positions for the purpose of the G7 meeting.</P>
      <P>The Euro 11 meeting also discussed procedural arrangements for the IMF's surveillance of the monetary and exchange rate policies of the euro area under Article IV of the fund's Articles of Agreement.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) held on the same day, consisted of the following issues:</P>
      <P>
        <i>1. Agenda 2000</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>ECOFIN considered the progress of Agenda 2000 negotiations, focusing on stabilisation of expenditure and the own resources financing system. The discussion on stabilisation focused on agricultural and structural funds expenditure. I emphasised the need to provide sufficient resources for the orderly development of the Union's policies. I underlined our view that the</P>
      <P>Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals are the correct basis for discussion, and in relation to Structural Funds, pointed out the importance of appropriate transitional arrangements for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The discussion on the own resources financing system focused on perceived imbalances in relation to net contributions, and alternative means of addressing this issue.</P>
      <P>
        <i>2. Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Stability Programme of Italy (1999-2001) &ndash; Opinion of the Council</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council examined Italy's stability programme. The Council considered that the strategy of budgetary consolidation presented in the programme goes in the right direction and is satisfied that the Italian Government intends to strengthen the progress achieved in public finances in recent years. The Council encouraged <Col N="353" /> the Italian Government to pursue the reduction of the public deficit with determination, although there are risks that the target of 2 per cent of GDP for 1999 could be missed due to lower-than-projected growth rates. The Council noted that Italy intends to meet the GDP/debt ratio requirements fully by 2002. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Stability Programme of Portugal (1999-2002) &ndash; Opinion of the Council</P>
    <P>The Council examined Portugal's stability programme and noted that the programme builds upon the budgetary consolidation achieved in the run-up to EMU and commanded the achievement of better than targeted budgetary outcomes. The macroeconomic projections seem plausible, although it was noted that there could be risks associated with the international economic situation on the one hand, and the risk of inflation due to expansionary effects on the domestic economy. Any inflationary pressures should be resolutely addressed. The Council supported the Portuguese Government's emphasis on the role of investment, particularly for a catching-up country. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Convergence Programme of Sweden (1998-2001): Opinion of the Council</P>
    <P>The Council next examined the convergence programme for Sweden. The macroeconomic projections were considered to be realistic and noted the recent success in budgetary consolidation. The Council noted that qualification for EMU will require that Sweden demonstrate its ability to stay in line with an appropriate parity between the krona and the Euro over a sufficient period of time. The Council expects Sweden to join the ERM2 in due course. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Convergence Programme of the UK (1997-8-2003-4): Opinion of the Council</P>
    <P>The final programme to be examined was the convergence programme of the UK. The Council noted with approval that the public finances are projected to be close to balance over the programme period and acknowledged that the growth scenario appeared realistic. The Council recommended that the UK continue the policy framework with a view to securing exchange rate stability which should help reinforce a stable economic environment. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>3. Economic Situation and Economic Policies of Community and Member States: Orientation debate on macro-economic issues, including economic reform report</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Council held its first orientation debate on the policy issues to be dealt with in the broad economic policy guidelines. Draft recommendations on these guidelines are to be presented in early May. The Council invited the Commission to take note of views expressed by Ministers. The <Col N="354" /> Council also noted the presentation by Commissioner Monti of the <i>Cardiff I</i> report by the Commission on <i>The Functioning of the Product and Capital Markets</i>. This report has been produced in line with the Cardiff council conclusions. It is being examined by the economic policy committee and, along with national reform reports and work being carried out in the economic policy committee will form the basis for a Cardiff II report to be presented to Council in March.</P>
    <P>Ministers discussed the following items over lunch:</P>
    <P>Financial Services: Building a frame work for action</P>
    <P>Over lunch, the Council noted a letter from Commissioner Monti advocating urgent agreement on a number of key proposals in the financial services sector. The Council agreed that urgent agreement on the proposals is important in order to complete the internal market in the financial sector, and indicated that they would try to reach rapid adoption of the necessary measures. Certain member states indicated that there were a number of problems associated with some of the Commission's proposals.</P>

The first such auction was held on 18 February 1999 and was very successful. One hundred and fifty million euro was auctioned in the 6.5 per cent Treasury Bond 2001 and attracted demand of 465 million euro, or over three times the amount auctioned. The average yield of accepted bids in the auction was 3.15 per cent, which was eight basis points over the comparable German bond.</P>
    <P>In relation to the secondary market, the Irish Stock Exchange data on annual turnover in Government bonds indicates a marked reduction in 1998. This was attributable to the fact that convergence on Government bond yields between Ireland and Germany had largely occurred by end-1997 and, as a result, certain investors such as spread traders, ceased to participate in the Government bond market &ndash; not only in Ireland but in Government bond markets generally in the euro during 1998.</P>

      <P>The package of new Revenue powers introduced in the Finance Bill is not intended to place any additional burden on small business. The main focus of the new powers is to rectify inadequacies in existing Revenue powers, particularly in the area of access to information held by or in financial institutions. The proposed new powers are an important element in restoring public confidence in the tax system, which has been severely dented by the revelations of the past two years.</P>
      <P>The compliant small businessman or businesswoman has nothing to fear from these new powers. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has publicly indicated on RTE radio that the new powers would not be focused on smaller cases and that appropriate checks and balances would be put in place to ensure that only properly authorised and trained Revenue personnel would have access to any new powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small business sector is vitally important for the future economic success of this country and this Government is committed to minimising regulation and compliance costs for that sector. I <Col N="356" /> can assure the Deputy that the new powers will be used by Revenue to combat the very real problem of tax evasion in such a way that will not disadvantage or create additional compliance costs for small enterprises striving to develop their businesses in an honest and compliant manner.</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on the management group which has been involved in negotiations with the Nursing Alliance about a number of claims which the unions referred to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court following publication of the report of the commission on nursing. These claims were considered by the Labour Court at hearings held on 25 October and 3 December 1998. The views of the management group on these claims were outlined in detail in two written submissions to the Labour Court and I can arrange for the Health Service Employers Agency to furnish the Deputy with copies of these submissions if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court issued its recommendations on the claims on 9 February 1999. My colleague, Deputy Cowen, Minister for Health and Children issued a statement the following day on behalf of the Government which indicated that the Government was prepared to accept the recommendations, and that the Health Service Employers' Agency had been asked to invite the nursing unions to enter into immediate discussions on the basis recommended by the Labour Court. I understand that both sides met on 16 February and agreed a schedule of meetings for further discussions, beginning today, 25 February 1999.</P>
      <P>The issues involved are being dealt with in accordance with the established industrial relations machinery. It is important not to undermine this process and, accordingly, I do not consider it would be appropriate for me to comment on the discussions which are now under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my response to a priority question about duty free sales today.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the contents of the Commission report which was presented on 17 February 1999. The Commission has concluded that the overall effect on employment, post 30 June 1999, will not be as negative as feared. The Commission cites the following reasons for its belief &ndash; sales of previously duty free goods will continue as people wait at airports and have time on board ferries, the price advantage is not always significant <i>vis-à-vis</i> high street shops, except for tobacco, safety regulations will be a determinant with regard to staffing levels on aircraft, and there will be certain gains to the national exchequers.</P>
      <P>Data as requested by Deputy Callely is not routinely collected, but as the House is aware, my Department specially commissioned KPMG to examine the impact of the abolition of duty free and tax free sales for intra-EU travel and to specifically consider the impact on Government revenues, the impact on points of entry and carriers and the impact on the cost of travel. The report was presented in March 1998 and a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library. It shows information about duty free sales including employment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, there are both public and private operators in this area of activity. I can confirm to the House that the KPMG report stated that total intra-EU duty and tax free sales in Ireland in 1996 was in excess of £100 million including £64 million by Aer Rianta. I have no reason to believe that there was any fall off in this figure during 1997 and 1998 given the substantial increase in the number of travellers.</P>

The budget and economic strategy presented in the stability programme will maintain this approach. In particular, it will continue to add significant resources to a larger expenditure base, to reduce Ireland's infrastructural deficit, while at the same time continuing prudent management of the budget and the economy over the medium term.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was established under the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, to borrow money for the Exchequer and to manage the national debt. No change in this role is envisaged.</P>
      <P>As regards the possible impact of the introduction of the euro on the functions of the agency, the national debt is now overwhelmingly in domestic currency, the euro being the currency of the State and the Irish pound unit being a subdivision of it. In consequence, the foreign exchange risk aspect of the agency's business has reduced considerably. However, important areas of risk remain to be managed even with the advent of the single currency &ndash; including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operations risk and credit risk &ndash; and they will continue to be handled by the NTMA. In addition, in the new environment of EMU, the agency now has to compete with other sovereign borrowers issuing bonds denominated in the same currency &ndash; the euro. This presents the agency with a significant marketing challenge. It is a challenge which I am confident will be successfully met.</P>
      <P>I have also been considering proposals which would entail assignment to the NTMA of new functions in areas where the agency's experience and expertise can be used to good effect. For example, following the assignment to the agency last year of responsibility for the management of part of FEOGA-related debt, it is proposed that management of the remaining FEOGA debt will be transferred to the agency in the near future. I am also considering proposals for the involvement of the agency in a number of other areas, including the handling of certain compensation claims against the State, and for the provision of a central treasury service whereby the agency would be able to offer certain cash management facilities to local authorities, health boards, VEC's and other Exchequer funded bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>Maintaining economic growth and promoting employment are the main objectives of economic policy in Europe. The appropriate economic policy mix in Europe, including budgetary policy, was set out in the broad economic policy guidelines agreed at the Cardiff European Council and is discussed on a regular basis at both ECOFIN and Euro 11 meetings in which I participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stability and growth pact outlines the parameters for the conduct of fiscal policy in Economic and Monetary Union. This stipulates that <Col N="362" /> member states must keep their budgetary positions at close to balance or in surplus in normal economic conditions. The objective of the pact is to ensure that member states have the necessary leeway to avoid an excessive deficit in the event of an economic slowdown.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the stability and growth pact is a key element of this economic strategy. Further fiscal consolidation is required to support the policy goals of the ECB. However, macroeconomic policy is just one element of economic policy at EU level. It is widely recognised that structural reform is required if unemployment is to be significantly reduced. Arising from the Cardiff European Council, reform of product, capital and labour markets is now a top priority. Improving the efficiency of markets will enhance competitiveness and promote employment.</P>
    <P>As regards budgetary policy in Ireland, in my December budget I provided once again for significant general Government surpluses out to 2001 and for further &ndash; reductions in the Government debt/GDP ratio. This prudent approach to budgetary policy will support the continuation of low inflation in Ireland. In accordance with the stability and growth pact, Ireland's stability programme was submitted to the European Commission in conjunction with the 1999 budget. The programme outlined our medium term economic and budgetary projections and policies.</P>
    <P>At January's ECOFIN it was concluded that Ireland's budgetary policy complied with the stability and growth pact.  The Council opinion also acknowledged the excellent supply side performance of the economy in recent years. It is this performance which has enabled us to combine strong growth with moderate inflation.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties some people are experiencing in obtaining the necessary primary certificate to avail of disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions; if statistics show any particular matter on cases that are appealed; if the reviews of the scheme have been completed; the submissions, if any, he has received on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, require that a disabled person meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer. Refusal of a primary medical certificate may be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board, whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>There is increasing demand by applicants to gain the benefits of this scheme. In many cases, applicants do not meet the basic conditions to qualify but appeal the case regardless. While figures are not available for 1996, 220 cases were referred to the board in 1997 and 260 cases were referred in 1998. Some 120 cases are currently being dealt with by the board. The Deputy may wish to note that the number of successful first time applicants under the scheme has increased from 869 in 1996 to 1,245 in 1998.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, without examining each individual file, it is not possible to summarise the reasons why certificates have been refused other than to say that the specified medical criteria were not met.</P>
      <P>The review of the scheme, which is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has not yet been completed. A number of submissions have been received by my Department and by the Revenue Commissioners and have been forwarded to the group for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With my 1999 budget I published projections showing expenditure by individual Vote groups for 2000 and 2001 on a &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis. These projections are included in tables 4(a) and 5(a) of the Budget 1999 &ndash; Statistics and Tables document included with the 1999 budget folder which was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas on budget day, 2 December 1998.</P>
      <P>Table 4(a) deals with current expenditure and table 5(a) deals with capital expenditure. The figures for Vote groups in these tables are not financial envelopes; they are projections of the cost in 2000 and 2001 of the post-budget level of services in 1999.</P>
      <P>These tables also include a provision for unallocated current and capital expenditure. Total current and capital expenditure in 2000 and 2001 as shown in these tables &ndash; that is, the &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; projections plus the unallocated amount &ndash; are consistent with the Government's 4 per cent limit for the growth in net current spending and a 5 per cent limit for increases in capital spending.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech I said I would address the final phase of the move to multi-annual expenditure budgeting, which will involve the Government making decisions on the allocation of resources across all Vote groups, and that decisions by the Government on this issue by the end of the first quarter of 1999 will allow Departments ample time to plan their spending in 2000 and 2001. Work in this regard is in progress in my Department.</P>

      <P>Transfers of agricultural land between relatives attract stamp duty at half the normal rates of duty. There are no plans to abolish this relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994, provides for a reduction of two-thirds in the amount of stamp duty which would otherwise be <Col N="365" /> chargeable on the transfer of agricultural land to a young trained farmer. This relief was introduced for a three year period and was extended for a further three years until 31 December 1999 in the Finance Act, 1997, in line with a commitment given in the Partnership 2000 for inclusion employment and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the present relief for the transfer of agricultural land to young trained farmers will remain in place for the year 1999.</P>

      <P>The most recent meeting of the International Monetary Fund attended by me was the annual meeting of October 1998, which took place in Washington.</P>
      <P>In my speech to the meeting, I stressed that the IMF and World Bank should seek to ensure that debt relief measures take full account of the social dimension embrace widespread consultation in the countries in question and encourage sustainable economic development.</P>
      <P>I also argued for greater flexibility in the implementation of the HIPCs initiative, as well as speedier implementation, and application to as wide a range of the heavily indebted poor countries as possible. I pointed out that definitions of debt sustainability should be broadened to take human, as well as economic, development into account and that the two recent evaluations of the ESAF facility emphasise the need for the IMF &ldquo;to take full account of the social impact of policies in the design and implementation phases of macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes. The most vulnerable sections of the community must be afforded special consideration, with safeguards against the most severe consequences of structural adjustment policies.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I draw the attention of the House to the measures in support of third world debt relief which the Government adopted last September and which are now the subject of the debate before this House on the passage of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1998. The measures in this Bill will allow Ireland to move from its advocacy role in relation to debt relief and become a direct contributor to the HIPC initiative. This will give Ministers increased moral authority to call for increased efforts by the international community to reduce the burden of debt on third world countries to the greatest extent possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 64, 68, 73, 82, 118, 122, 181, 193, 202, 207, 214 and 227 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last weekend I announced that I had directed my Department to produce proposals for the Government for the establishment of a scheme of compensation for Army hearing loss. The objective of the scheme will be to provide those a with genuine disability, as measured in accordance with the Green Book system, with an alternative to proceeding against the State in the courts. It is my intention that this scheme will ensure that persons with a grave disability should receive compensation which fairly reflects the seriousness of their injury while those with minor disability should receive payments which reflect the lesser effect of their injuries in their everyday life. I <Col N="368" /> envisage the scheme settling the outstanding claims within three years instead of the estimated 17 years required to process them through the courts.</P>
    <P>Over recent months, many individuals have contacted me expressing support for a proposal on these lines and asking me to provide an alternative mechanism to litigation in the courts for the processing of genuine compensation claims. In this regard, I remain hopeful that the representative associations will come on board and support a genuine attempt to resolve this issue fairly and speedily.</P>
    <P>With regard to the statistical information sought by Deputies, to date, my Department has received a total of 13,880 claims for alleged loss of hearing from current and former members of the Defence Forces, of which 4,537 have been received since my appointment as Minister on 7 October, 1997. A total of 162 claims have been received since 1 January, 1999 or an average of about 27 claims per week. Of the total number of claims received, 143 have been cleared by way of court awards and 2,197 by out of court settlements; 126 claims have been withdrawn or dismissed which leaves a total of 11,414 claims outstanding.</P>
    <P>Almost £51 million has been paid in awards and settlements and £14 million has been paid on plaintiffs legal costs. Subsequent to the judgment in the case of Hanley<i> v</i> Minister for Defence in June last, my Department estimated that the cost of clearing the outstanding cases would be £550 million for loss of hearing. Legal costs, loss of earnings and special damages could bring the overall cost to in excess of £1 billion.</P>
    <P>In relation to claims received to date in 1999, it is not possible to give a reasoned estimate of the cost of clearing these cases; first because it is my hope that most of them will be barred by the statute of limitations; and, second, indications are that the majority of the more recent claims received have little or no hearing disability. However, if the average amount of compensation paid in these cases to date were to prevail, the cost involved would be of the order of £4.3 million including costs.</P>
    <P>With regard to claims from serving members, my Department's records indicate that a total of 4,297 claims have been received of which 937 have been disposed of, leaving 3,360 outstanding. This represents approximately 35 per cent of the P.D.F.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this litigation has had a damaging effect on the Defence Forces and the public perception of the Army. This is very unfortunate given the high regard in which the Defence Forces have been held both at home and abroad before the onset of these claims. There is also no doubt that it has taken the focus off the development and progress made in improving the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces review implementation plan and which will continue with the forthcoming White Paper on defence. However, I am determined to do everything <Col N="369" /> within my power to restore the morale and good reputation of the Defence Forces. In this regard, the establishment of a compensation scheme is an important first step.</P>

      <P>The representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, RACO and PDFORRA, operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme which provides a means for both sides to discuss issues which are of importance to them and to arrive at mutually acceptable resolutions. The scheme and its enabling legislation also sets out the range of subjects which come within the scope of representation.</P>
      <P>The issues ascribed to the general secretary of PDFORRA as referred to by the Deputy would be specifically excluded, by legislation, from the association's remit and from the representative process. I do not, therefore, wish to comment on the matter other than to say that I consider such matters, which pertain to issues of policy, as being more appropriate for consideration by the Government and Dáil Éireann. Public statements such as those made recently by members of the Defence Forces in relation to policy issues are not appropriate.</P>
      <P>Having said this, as the Deputy is undoubtedly aware, the terms of the Amsterdam treaty, which were discussed at great length in the time leading up to the signing of the treaty, involve a wide range of issues and I have no doubt that Ireland will discharge any relevant commitments as appropriate. In relation to the EU's common foreign and security policy, the White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty explains fully the commitments involved. The treaty brings within the remit of the common foreign and security policy, the &ldquo;Petersberg Tasks&rdquo; of humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management. The treaty provides that it will be for the Western European Union to carry out such tasks, at the instigation of the EU. Ireland will be entitled to participate in such tasks, and has indicated its willingness to contribute to such tasks on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Ireland considers it important that the EU should seek to ensure the effective functioning of these new provisions on peacekeeping and crisis management, when the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 28 apprentices at the Army apprentice school in Devoy Barracks prior to the closure <Col N="371" /> of that barracks. Of these, 18 are now attending the Dublin Institute of Technology, either at Bolton Street or at Kevin Street for the purpose of completing their final 'off job' training module. This module consists of ten weeks. These 18 apprentices are variously training as fitters, carpenters and electricians. They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January.</P>
    <P>The remaining ten apprentices, who are training in electronics/communications, have relocated to the school of signals on the Curragh. Their training will be continuing into the middle of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Since the closure of Devoy Barracks, the various apprentices have been either engaged with &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; aspects of their apprenticeship training or military training. The training schedules of the majority of the apprentices were not materially affected by the closure of Devoy Barracks, in relation to either their core military or &ldquo;trade&rdquo; training.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place between the Department of Education and Science, my own Department and the Teachers Union of Ireland in relation to the future of the teachers formerly employed at the Army apprentice school. These discussions centre on the possible redeployment of the teachers within the educational system and on an early retirement package. As these discussions are ongoing, it would be wrong of me to comment further on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 84, 88, 101, 111, 117, 127, 187, 188, 189, 190 and 192 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considered the reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process has been set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. The reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service must be seen in the broader context of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces generally. The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan made specific provision for the special studies of the Air Corps and the Naval Service on the basis that the initial Price Waterhouse review had necessarily concentrated on the Army. Price Waterhouse's 1998 report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service sets out a range of recommendations for more <Col N="374" /> effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations can be proceeded with fairly quickly while others will take longer. As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and that of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is no question of being selective in a negative way with regard to the recommendations. It is however important that implementation of the recommendations are undertaken in a planned way having regard to the development of the Defence Forces as a whole. This is why I have asked the Chief of Staff in conjunction with the GOC of the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked for a submission from the Chief of Staff to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State which would form the basis of the longer term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service and which will be supported by the on-going effectiveness and efficiency measures. I understand that a considerable amount of work has been done and I would expect to receive draft proposals for my consideration in the near future. These proposals will include, <i>inter alia</i>, organisation, personnel, headquarters and options in relation to future equipment for both services.</P>
    <P>I have also emphasised the importance of involving all of the relevant stakeholders in the process. I have therefore established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State air and sea services. The consultation group, which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group has held one meeting at which I invited the stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this. The group will meet again as the planning and implementation process develops. In addition arrangements are in hand to ensure that the Defence Forces Representative Associations are kept informed of on-going developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  78, 86 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>A number of approaches have been made in the past year by private concerns regarding the possibility of the extension of the utilisation of Baldonnel for light aircraft/private jet use. As the bulk of military operations are conducted there, in particular basic flying training flights, the base could not be considered suitable for use by commercial airlines with scheduled services. In the circumstances the question of the deployment of military personnel to assist in the operation of commercial ventures at Baldonnel has not arisen. I might add that any proposals for the greater use of Baldonnel for the provision of a non-military aviation service are appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The value of the land at Casement Aerodrome has not been assessed to date.</P>

    <P>The service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps. From the outset the scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who are currently rated on <Col N="377" /> and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin Aircraft which are the principle operational aircraft in the Air Corps. The scheme, the conditions of which were not changed as suggested by the Deputy, was introduced with a view to retaining senior pilots who occupy key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. The gratuities are designed to strike a balance between the demand of the commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining qualified personnel.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the incentive scheme has helped to stabilise the drain of pilots from the Air Corps. A total of 14 pilots have opted to participate in the service commitment scheme and it is likely that a number of pilots who will become eligible for participation in the scheme later this year will also opt to participate.</P>

    <P>There are currently three sergeant major positions vacant in the Air Corps. One vacancy is in air traffic control and two vacancies are aircraft technical positions. The vacancy in the air traffic control area has arisen due to the recent promotion of the previous holder of the post to commissioned rank as an air traffic control officer. Four NCOs are currently undergoing a Senior NCOs Course. Successful completion of this course will facilitate their participation in inter<Col N="379" /> views for vacancies which have arisen at sergeant major rank.</P>
    <P>To enable a wider pool of candidates to be eligible to compete for these vacancies, the GOC Air Corps has decided that the vacancies will not be filled until the senior NCOs course is complete. The course is due to be completed on 12 March, 1999.</P>

      <Col N="380" /> On 7 February 1999 between 06.50 hours and 07.23 hours armed elements attacked Haddathah Compound from locations within the IRISHBATT area of operations. Between 06.50 hours and 07.35 hours on 7 February the Israeli Defence Force/De Facto Forces responded by firing into the IRISHBATT area of operations, resulting in injuries to two members of the Defence Forces serving with 84 IRISHBATT.</P>
    <P>The technical ordnance report on the incident confirms that one mortar round impacted on the roof of the Company HQ (UN position 6-38). Eight other rounds impacted in a pattern from five to 50 metres on and around the perimeter of the HQ. The military authorities have reported that this clearly indicates that the UN position was the identified target. A crater analysis revealed that the rounds were fired from varying Israeli Defence Force-De Facto Forces positions and Israeli markings were also found on the remains of four mortars.</P>
    <P>The two members of the Defence Forces &ndash; Cpl. Noel Roche and Pte. John Flaherty &ndash; serving with 84 IRISHBATT who were wounded by the mortar round which impacted on the roof of the UN post were admitted to the UNIFIL hospital in Naquora but have since returned to duty. It was extremely fortunate that their injuries were not much more serious or that there was no loss of life in this case. There was also considerable damage to the building and its equipment.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of the incident were reported immediately by IRISHBATT to UNIFIL Headquarters which in turn protested to the Israeli Defence Force through the usual liaison channels.</P>
    <P>At my request the Department of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest about this incident with the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland. The ambassador was asked to bring the contents of the protest to the attention of his authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was the subject of a Private Members' Motion and debate on 28 January 1999 in this House culminating in the passing by the House of a Government Resolution undertaking favourably to examine further Ireland's <Col N="381" /> participation in PfP taking into account the on-going public debate.</P>
    <P>In addition my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a reply to a Question on 17 February, 1999 gave an undertaking that any decision by the Government in favour of Ireland's participation in PfP would make clear the nature and scope of such participation, and would be submitted to this House for its approval.</P>
    <P>As regards implications for the Defence Forces of a decision to participate in PfP, I would envisage that any possible future role for the Defence Forces would be in the area of peacekeeping, and humanitarian and rescue tasks. Participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. In addition, individual states decide on the scope and extent of their participation in PfP activities and in this regard agree individual partnership programmes covering the activities to which they wish to subscribe. In Ireland's case, should we decide at any time in the future to participate in PfP, it is envisaged that selected activities would, as I have said, include peacekeeping under a UN mandate, humanitarian and rescue tasks, etc., &ndash; all activities in line with our traditional involvement and experience in these areas.</P>
    <P>During the aforementioned debate in the House you will recall that the Taoiseach stated that he would envisage, all going well, that Ireland will join Partnership for Peace on a mutually agreed basis in the second half of this year, and that the Government will be working towards that timetable. The Taoiseach sees the current debate regarding PfP as allowing an opportunity to the different parties in Dáil Eireann to formulate their positions and to put them before the people as part of the European election platforms.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also indicated that it is not the Government's intention that joining PfP would result in a change in the real level of defence spending. Having said that, it is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations with which they are tasked from time to time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>A number of meetings have taken place between my Department and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, with a view to using St. Bricin's military hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred.</P>
      <P>Agreement in principle was reached on the introduction of a pilot scheme under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. Some preparatory work has been carried out in St. Bricin's in anticipation of the implementation of this project. It was recognised by all of the parties involved that a range of issues would have to be addressed before the pilot scheme could commence. It is intended that if the pilot scheme is successful a long-term arrangement involving up to 20 patients would be put in place.</P>
      <P>Overall responsibility for the health and well-being of civilian patients in this country rests with the Department of Health and Children and it is essential that, in order to discharge its duties and responsibilities, that Department fully satisfies itself concerning all of the arrangements pertaining to the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients while in St. Bricin's hospital. The Department of Health and Children has advised the Mater Hospital of its requirements in this regard, and it is understood that the matter is currently being pursued by the hospital authorities. A number of legal and insurance issues must also be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the above requirements, it will formally approach my Department to request that St. Bricin's hospital <Col N="383" /> provide the facilities described above. In the meantime, I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government conducted a review of the roles of the Defence Forces in 1993 to take account of the changed international environment. &ldquo;To participate in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace&rdquo; is among the assigned roles. Defence Force legislation provides for such involvement. Participation in UN peacekeeping missions has, as the Deputy will be aware, been a major feature of Defence Forces activities for the past forty years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions in relation to participation by the Defence Forces in overseas missions are taken by the Government and Dáil Éireann, as appropriate, in accordance with the legislation and taking account of certain established criteria. The <Col N="385" /> arrangements that apply with regard to any particular mission in relation to rules of engagement and command and control are those prescribed by the United Nations and as set out in Security Council resolutions.</P>
    <P>In keeping with Ireland's voluntary and long-standing peacekeeping tradition, the Government is willing to make a continuing contribution to peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In addition, I might say that future involvement by the Defence Forces in Petersberg Tasks under the auspices of the Amsterdam Treaty or arising from participation by Ireland in Partnership for Peace (PfP) should this occur at any time in the future, would most likely be in the areas of peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks on a voluntary and case by case basis.</P>

      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote in updating military equipment for the Defence Forces. Total amounts spent on such equipment for the past four years are as follows:&ndash; 1995, £18 million; 1996, £20 million; 1997, £31 million and 1998, £37 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately £55 million. will be spent on equipment this year.</P>
      <P>Some of the more important developments in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment are:&ndash; a new fishery patrol vessel due for delivery later this year; the supply of 16 new turrets and 16 fire directing systems for fitting to existing Panhard armoured cars. The first two turrets and two fire directing systems will be delivered and fitted next month and the balance is expected to be delivered and fitted towards the end of this year; the supply in 1998 of 12 refurbished 105mm. light artillery guns to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete; delivery, in December 1998, of the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of approximately £10.5 million. and expenditure in 1998 of approximately £3.5 million. on new troop carrying vehicles, such as 4 × 4's, three quarter ton trucks, buses, motorcycles and an ambulance.</P>
      <P>The competition for the supply of up to 40 armoured personnel carriers over a five year period has now moved to the final phase with the issuing of tender documentation to the two firms successful in the first phase.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>It has always been recognised that military personnel may be exposed to traumatic situations leading to what has in the past been described as &ldquo;battle stress disorder&rdquo;. Indeed, one of the aims of military training is to create a sense of comradeship and mutual support to enable personnel to cope with the stress which is an inevitable part of military operations from time to time. Support from commanders, from the medical corps and from the chaplaincy service have always been available when required. In more recent times, following developments in the medical sciences which have led to the identification of what we now call post traumatic stress disorder, procedures have been put in place which formalise these traditional support systems throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces now operate a stress management and post traumatic stress disorder programme the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to provide support to personnel so that they can deal with trauma and stressful situations in an appropriate and timely manner. This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>
      <P>Cases of post traumatic stress disorder are referred in the first instance to the military psychiatrist at St. Bricin's Military Hospital. A multidisciplinary approach to case management is generally adopted and is led by the psychiatrist. The team may include nurses of the Army Nursing Service with training in counselling skills, social workers of the personnel support service, the chaplaincy service and appropriate colleagues. The psychiatrist may also refer cases to civilian agencies, particularly clinical psychologists, if he feels that is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 8 December, 1998 to allow up to 30 members of the Permanent Defence Force and the Garda Síochána to participate in the Kosovo Verification Mission &ndash; KVM &ndash; which was established last year by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &ndash; OSCE. It was intended that up to 27 members of the Defence Forces and up to three members of the Garda Síochána would be deployed.</P>
      <P>Five members of the Defence Forces are currently serving in key appointments with the mission. Personnel are selected individually by the OSCE on the basis of submitted curriculum vitae (CVs). In this connection ten further CVs in respect of members of the Permanent Defence Force were recently submitted to the OSCE for consideration.</P>
      <P>The matter of the deployment of further members of the Defence Forces up to the limit approved by Government will be kept under review in the light of the outcome of the Rambouillet peace talks and the prevailing security situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to participation in humanitarian tasks, a total of 27 military personnel has been seconded to APSO to assist in the relief effort in Honduras following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.</P>
      <P>Apart from the aforementioned no recent requests for participation by the Defence Forces in overseas missions have been received.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 123, 129 and 199 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance's submission on the White Paper on Defence was received in my Department on 18 January 1999. The submission <Col N="389" /> is one of 41 submissions received to date as part of the White Paper consultative process.</P>
    <P>As is to be expected, I understand that there is a considerable variety of views contained in these submissions. I have made it clear that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any one individual submission received by my Department as part of the consultative process. It is important to respect the right of all individuals and organisations to submit their views in this way.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, which will be the first ever White Paper on Defence, will provide a framework for the evolution of policy and for the on-going reorganisation process in the Defence Forces and set out a strategy for the next ten years. The White Paper presents a positive opportunity to develop the Defence Forces. It involves a range of foundation work which will form the basis of the future planning elements of the White Paper. These foundation elements relate to an assessment of the defence and security environment, an examination of the progress already made in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan and, of course, the consultative process. This process will of course include the Defence Forces representative associations. Based on these planning elements, the detailed White Paper preparation will proceed. I would expect to be able to bring my proposals to the Government around summer of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Emergency planning and preparations for coping with the consequences of nuclear fallout have been a concern of my Department over many years. The accident in Chernobyl in 1985 brought it home to us all how vulnerable we can be to a nuclear accident happening many miles from our shores.</P>
      <P>In the subsequent years planning has been undertaken to organise all the resources of the State to cope with the consequences of such situations. The Government approved a National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents and this was published in booklet form in 1992 under the auspices of the Department of Energy. The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan has been exercised at national and international level under the auspices of the Department of Public Enterprise which is the lead Government Department in such situations and my Department has played its full part. The <Col N="390" /> process of review is ongoing and late last year a number of procedural and practical improvements to the plan were identified and these have now been approved by Government.</P>
    <P>The roles assigned to the Department of Defence are clearly laid out and involve duties for the Defence Force and Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>My Department holds instruments that can detect and measure alpha, beta and gamma radiation. Equipment is also available to carry out environmental sampling. Much of the equipment has been issued to local authorities where Civil Defence Units regularly train and exercise to provide an effective crisis response. Similar equipment is on issue to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister of Defence, must be mindful of the threat of fallout arising from nuclear weapons which is, thankfully, considered a more distant prospect than it has been in the past. Nonetheless I am concerned to see that planning and preparation are kept at an appropriate level.</P>

      <P>The overall strength for the Defence Forces has now reached a level of 11,500 which is the figure set out in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan (1996-1998), for phase one of the reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>This figure of 11,500 comprises the following strengths for the three components of the Defence Forces: Army, 9,487; Naval Service, 1,089; Air Corps, 924.</P>
      <P>The implementation plan also provided for special studies to be carried out on the Naval Service and the Air Corps and Price Waterhouse management consultants were engaged to conduct such a review.  In their report, Price Waterhouse recommended a slight adjustment in the strengths of the Air Corps and Naval Service to the following; &ndash;  Naval Service 1,144 and Air Corps 930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has now considered the final report from Price Waterhouse and has agreed in principle the proposal that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by <Col N="391" /> the Naval Service and the Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multi-tasking/multi-capabilities and dedicated services, and that Government decision-making on equipping and staffing of the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be made accordingly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 191 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service in this country.  The Air Corps provides a search and rescue service from Finner, County Donegal and Waterford Regional Airport as part of the overall search and rescue arrangements. Bond Helicopters provide a search and rescue service, using medium lift helicopters, from Shannon and Dublin Airports under contract to IMES.  The service operating from Dublin Airport commenced on 1 July 1998, prior to which the Air Corps provided search and rescue coverage on the east coast. It had been intended that the new service would be crewed by Air Corps personnel and would operate from Casement Aerodrome <Col N="394" /> once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase had been resolved. This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority. The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years meant that the Air Corps was not in a position to provide pilots for the new service. Provision was, however, made in the contract with the operator for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date. The new service is operating from Dublin Airport with the option of relocating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process has been set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. I have asked the Chief of Staff in conjunction with the GOC of the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked for a submission from the Chief of Staff to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State which would form the basis of the longer term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service and which will be supported by the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency measures. I understand that a considerable amount of work has been done and I would expect to receive draft proposals for my consideration in the near future. These proposals will include, <i>inter alia</i>, organisation, personnel, infrastructure and options in relation to future equipment for both services.</P>

      <P>Hangar no. 4 at Baldonnel has been showing signs of general age deterioration. Last year a detailed examination of the building was carried out by the corps of engineers. It was found to be structurally sound but a number of shortcomings were noted. The hangar is heated by air blowers supplemented by smaller electrical appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme of works to address specific defects has been commenced. In January 1999 a contract was placed for reconstruction of gable <Col N="395" /> piers and it is anticipated that a contract for reroofing will be placed later this year. Toilet and shower facilities are being installed by the corps of engineers. Further works will be undertaken as necessary and as resources permit.</P>

      <P>At the invitation of the Austrian Minister for Defence I attended a meeting of Defence Ministers of the member states of the European Union in Vienna on 3 and 4 November 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The invitation from the Austrian Minister was extended in September last year when Austria held the Presidency of the EU. The meeting, a once-off and informal event, was non-decision making in character and was held outside the institutional framework of the EU. No decisions or conclusions were reached and no final document was produced. Defence Ministers of all the 15 EU member states, including the EU neutral states, attended as well as the Secretary General of the Western European Union (WEU). Discussions focused primarily on the development perspectives of European peacekeeping and crisis management with particular emphasis on the practical effect of the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty of Amsterdam. This reflected a recognition that the need to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts, such as those that have occurred in the former Yugoslavia, is the current <Col N="396" /> key security challenge facing the UN and the international community as a whole. I found this an area of great interest and importance for Ireland in view of our strong commitment to European integration and in consequence of our long history of support for peacekeeping operations. These two fundamental concepts are brought together in Ireland's readiness to contribute to Petersberg Tasks on a voluntary and case-by-case basis as is our right in accordance with our observer status at the Western European Union. On the basis of our voluntary and long peacekeeping experience, Ireland is ready to make a continuing contribution to strengthening the international community's conflict prevention and crisis management capabilities and I made this known during the course of the meeting. Ireland has, along with our fellow neutral EU member states, and many other non-NATO states, moved into a new dimension of regional peacekeeping through our participation in the Stabilisation Force in Bosnia &ndash; SFOR. The Vienna meeting provided a timely opportunity to share experiences in the peacekeeping area with those other countries with which we have much in common.</P>
    <P>The focus of the meeting was very firmly in the area of peacekeeping and crisis management. My contribution to the discussions was in that context. I was pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to the meeting and to indicate Ireland's approach to the issues raised.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any plans for further meetings of this nature.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Vienna meeting, I have had occasional informal discussions with other European Defence Ministers on the margins of Western European Union Ministerial Council meetings as the occasions presented.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget package for 1999 announced by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil on 2 December 1998 made provision for an increase in the DÍON allocation for Irish community welfare organis<Col N="397" /> ations in Britain to £750,000, representing an increase of £125,000 in the amount previously included in the 1999 Estimates for this purpose. The increase in the size of the grant is for the purpose of improving services for older Irish emigrants and travellers in Britain.</P>
    <P>While no absolute guarantee can be given in any funding area I am committed to ensuring that the DÍON allocation is maintained at the increased level in 2000 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The recent rates of exchange between sterling and the punt have caused difficulties for the DÍON grant recipients as they receive their grant payments in punts. While it would be possible for my Department to make grant payments in sterling, the amounts involved would continue to have to be calculated at the appropriate punt equivalent, in accordance with the overall amount voted by the Oireachtas. There is no alternative to this procedure.</P>

      <P>I am deeply concerned that there is any suggestion of a breach of the Restrictive Practise (Groceries Order) 1987. This would be a most serious development that would fundamentally be anti-consumer. it is essential that fair and equitable business practices operate in all sectors. This is all the more important in a sector, such as the supermarket sector, on which so many ordinary consumers depend for basic grocery products.</P>
      <P>The Groceries Order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs and I am delighted that she has launched such a speedy investigation into the allegations levelled. I hope that her inquiry can be completed speedily and that all parties give the fullest co-operation to the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to the director to initiate proceedings in the District Court for alleged breaches of the order. On summary conviction in that court, the maximum fine is £500 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months. There is also provision for a fine of up to £50 per day in respect of a continuing offence. On conviction on indict<Col N="399" /> ment the penalties are up to £10,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>Together with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Consumer Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, I will consider a full report from the director on completion of her investigation and if any legislative amendment is necessary to ensure that this practice is eliminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs assessed the Irish motor insurance market in relation to consumer choice and price competition. The report found that Irish motorists are better catered for than their UK counterparts, with three active insurers per 100,000 private cars in Ireland compared with 0.3 insurers per 100,000 private cars in the UK. Deloitte &amp; Touche's survey of motor insurance premiums indicated that there was no uniform market price for motor insurance due to factors such as differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets, specialisation and segmentation of the market. Within these parameters, motor insurers quoted widely different premiums for similar risks and this is characteristic of a competitive market.</P>
      <P>While mature drivers with good safety records benefit from competition between insurers in particular segments of the motor insurance market, the consultants' survey found that young drivers were regarded as a high risk category and that certain insurers refused to quote for young drivers. The insurers' reluctance to quote was attributed to young motorists' poor claims record. The report found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17-24 year old drivers was over twice that for the 36-40 age group and that motorists in the 17-24 age group were responsible for over three and a half times the average claims cost of the 36-40 age group. The price index for motor insurance increased by 3.2 per cent in 1997 and 4.7 per cent in 1998. These increases reflected the sharp increase in underwriting losses experienced by the motor insurance industry from 1995 and the consequent need for insurers to raise premiums in order to provide for the increased cost of future claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is abundantly clear from the foregoing analyses that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. I have kept the House informed of initiatives being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness particularly among young drivers. These measures include the introduction of a scheme of insurance premium discounts by the insurance industry, in conjunction with the driving instructors' register, on completion of a required number of driving lessons. Other initiatives include the introduction <Col N="402" /> of road safety educational programmes for students and advertising campaigns by the National Safety Council to discourage speeding. The Department of Environment and Local Government is undertaking an examination of the Ontario graduated licensing system for learner drivers as a possible model for introduction here.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above initiatives, I re-established the motor insurance advisory board in September 1998. The expanded membership of the new board is broadly representative of the consumer, insurance user and road safety and road traffic interests. I have asked the board to act not only as a monitoring agency but also to provide advice to me and our Department in regard to the current charges for motor insurance as between different risk categories of drivers having regard to the claims structure in each category. I have also asked the board to advise me on any matter which the board itself sees as affecting premiums charged and the methods of providing motor insurance.</P>

      <P>A working group representative of the social partners is currently considering the issue of access by women to labour market opportunities and is likely later this year to make recommendations on enhanced access. The group is chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It is important that women returners are facilitated to return to paid work on the basis of equity and because they constitute an important source of labour supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About one-third of the growth of 95,000 in the numbers at work in 1998, according to the Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO on 30 November 1998 is composed of higher labour force participation rates. The majority of persons in this category are women returning to paid work. Women who have worked in the home are accessing jobs in substantial numbers and the work-friendly nature of the last budget will assist this process. Many women returners avail of the services of FÁS, either for employment placement or for training. FÁS provides return to work training for those wishing to return to work after an extended absence from the labour market. The return to work programme helps participants to develop the confidence necessary to re-enter the labour force and is also an important bridging programme for progression onto other FÁS programmes. The programme is delivered on a part-time basis within <Col N="403" /> local communities. In 1998, 1,065 women completed return to work training.</P>
    <P>In 1996 and 1997 FÁS operated a pilot programme called Local Action for Women. The aim of the pilot was to develop and test new methods of providing training and employment services to women at local level, through active co-operation with locally-based community groups. The pilot was evaluated in 1998. In 1999, FÁS proposes to implement new approaches to providing return to work training for women which will incorporate the outcomes of the pilot. Rather than pursuing a return to work course many women returners move directly into skills training programmes and enterprise training, and from there directly into employment or self-employment.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply of 16 February 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the reports carried in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 19 July 1998. The Wise Finance Company Limited was incorporated in <Col N="405" /> the United Kingdom and registered as a branch in this State on 10 November 1995 under the European Communities (Branch Disclosures) Regulations, 1993. Its directors are Ronald Weisz and Fiona Weisz. The Registrar of Companies advises me that The Wise Finance Company Limited is up to date with its filing requirements.</P>
    <P>Allegations that Ronald Weisz was declared a bankrupt in New York State in 1994 and has a conviction in the United States for fraud were recently made to our Department. Section 183 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended, prohibits an undischarged bankrupt from acting as a director of a company. As the bankruptcy was allegedly declared in a foreign state, legal advice was sought on the issue of jurisdiction. I have been advised that a person declared a bankrupt in the US and remaining undischarged would not be in breach of section 183 by acting as a director in this jurisdiction by virtue of the definition of undischarged bankrupt as prescribed by section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963. I am also advised that the Irish courts do not necessarily recognise a foreign bankruptcy with the possible exception of, <i>inter alia</i>, a bankruptcy in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Such an issue will be considered in the preparation of future companies legislation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, advises me that The Wise Finance Company Limited which is primarily engaged in mortgage lending, does not require a licence/authorisation for its activities. Again, this is a further matter which will be taken into account in the preparation of future legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any proposals to <Col N="407" /> introduce restrictions on the sale or use of mobile telephones of the type mentioned by the Deputy. In any case, as I have no function in relation to health matters, I would have no role in the introduction of such restrictions. As I have stated before, I am aware of the Vienna EMF resolution which claims that the biological effects from low intensity exposures to non-ionising radiation are scientifically established. I am also aware that this claim of the resolution has proved to be controversial among the scientific community, as the bulk of research on the issue of non-ionising radiation has not shown any such link. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport issued a report on non-ionising microwave radiation emissions from communications masts in December, 1998. The joint committee concluded that:</P>
      <P>The evidence available at present does not indicate an unacceptable health hazard from microwave emissions within the IRPA (International Radiation Protection Association) guidelines.</P>
      <P>The IRPA guidelines are applied in Ireland through the licences held by mobile telephony and MMDS operators. It is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to ensure compliance with these requirements.</P>

In December 1998 the military board forwarded an initial, incomplete draft of its final report to the steering group for consideration. The steering group has completed its consideration of the draft report and has conveyed its views and recommendations thereon to the military board which will, in due course, submit its final report to the group.

      <P>The Department of Defence and the Chief State Solicitor's office had correspondence and a number of meetings last year with the Law Society and some of the individual solicitors concerned. The general purpose of our communications was to examine the level of legal fees and whether economies, particularly in the case of those firms of solicitors acting for a large number of plaintiffs in similar cases, could be achieved. On the question of fees, I was told that the solicitors concerned were already substantially discounting fees in these cases. I remain convinced, however, that there is further room for reduction. If and when a lower and more acceptable tariff in these cases is achieved, I will press for further discounts in the level of legal fees charged in these cases. In the meantime the State is in discussion with a number of solicitors to establish whether it is possible to achieve block settlements at reasonable rates. These discussions also include the issue of reduced legal fees. In any case where fees appear inordinate, the Chief State Solicitor applies to the Taxing Master of the High Court for an adjudication.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for internal security rests with the Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required. This entails assisting the Garda at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches, including in the Border area. The Defence Forces also assist the Garda in relation to prisoner, cash and explosives escorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demands on the Defence Forces in relation <Col N="414" /> to Border duty depend on the nature of the requests for assistance received from the Garda at any particular time. Currently these requests include the provision of armed parties in aid of the civil power for the purpose of protecting gardaí and the carrying out of such duties as vehicle checkpoints and mobile security patrols, specialist search team tasks and explosive ordnance disposal. The Defence Forces continue to respond to requests from the Garda in relation to Border security and other operations.</P>
    <P>The level of demand on the Defence Forces in aid of the Garda in the Border area following on the Good Friday Agreement is kept under review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Government Departments as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>

The prescribed minimum keenness of hearing standard for extension of service for personnel who enlisted on five year service engagements in 1994, is Grade 2 as prescribed in Defence Force Regulations A. 12. This standard requires that an individual's keenness of hearing must be not worse than the age related warning level prescribed in the guidelines on hearing checks and audiometry issued by the health and safety authority. Personnel who do not meet the prescribed standard will not be permitted to extend their service.</P>

      <P>Discussions are in progress at EU levels in relation to a proposal for a new Council directive laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens kept in various systems of rearing.  I am aware that, in considering this proposal, the European Parliament at its sitting of 28 January 1999 adopted a text which incorporates a prohibition on the use of battery cages for laying hens from 1 January 2009. This most recent development will be taken into account in discussions at both Council and working party levels.</P>
      <P>While I wish to see the highest possible welfare standards being introduced for laying hens, account must also be taken of the legitimate economic concerns of the producer and the consequences of measures taken. It would, for instance, be unfortunate if arrangements adopted within the EU were to result in the mass importation, into this country and other member states, of cheap battery-produced eggs from third countries which may have scant or no provisions on hen welfare.</P>

      <P>Degressivity as proposed by France would give rise to difficulties for Ireland. Annual reductions in direct payments would affect disproportionately sectors such as beef and cereals where direct payments contribute a major element of the support regime while affecting other sectors less or not at all. Also, a large proportion of small-scale farmers would be affected because of the low exemption limit. Major changes in the French proposal would be necessary, in my view, before I would consider it as making a worthwhile and equitable contribution towards resolving EU budgetary problems.</P>

This position was endorsed in the conclusions of the meeting of the Agriculture Council in May 1998 which agreed, at my request, that the reform of the CAP would have to take account of, <i>inter alia</i>, the dependence of particular member states or regions on specific sectors or types of production. I intend to ensure that the agreement on CAP reform will honour this commitment.</P>

      <P>I received a list from the Revenue Commissioners of the charitable exempt bodies that was made available to the Deputy earlier this month. The list consists of 5,666 bodies, which according to the Revenue records, held charitable exemption as of 31 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no function in relation to administering or monitoring compliance with the tax exemption for charitable bodies. Responsibility for the administration of the exemption and for monitor<Col N="423" /> ing compliance with the exemption are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. In my reply to a number of questions tabled by the Deputy on 17 November 1998, I outlined in some detail the manner in which Revenue operates controls on the exemption as well as the monitoring measures taken. As I informed the House on that occasion, I am satisfied that the exemption is administered by Revenue in an appropriate and balanced way.</P>

      <P>I have answered separately the Deputy's specific question in relation to the Peace Programme (27271/98). The Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme Monitoring Committee is also jointly chaired by the Department of Finance, Ireland and Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland. This committee has a similar remit to that of the Peace Programme and has met eight times since it was established in 1995. It has taken decisions relating to the distribution of the annual deflators, the re-distribution of funding following the mid-term review, and increasing the emphasis on cross-Border strategy.</P>
      <P>The Joint Monitoring Committee of the Ireland/Wales INTERREG Programme 1994/1999 was established under Commission decision of 14 December 1995 approving the programme. The committee has met on seven occasions since then to review progress on the implementation of the programme, including the response to the mid term evaluation. It has taken decisions in relation to the distribution of annual deflators, the reprofiling of expenditure and the redistribution of funding between measures. It has also adopted strategic guidance on the publicisation of the programme and activities of the local co-ordinating team.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee of the INTERREG lIc North West Metropolitan Area Operational Programme has met once since the Commission decision of 3 June 1998 approving the programme. The decisions taken at that meeting, and subsequently by written procedure, related mainly to the approval of the management structure, administrative and financial procedures, applicant information, project selection criteria, the programme secretariat's work plan and technical assistance budget and the publicity strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The key event I attended to mark the launch of the euro was the meeting of the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN on 31 December 1998. At that meeting, and in accordance with <Col N="425" /> Article 109L(4) of the Treaty on European Union, the Council, acting with the unanimity of the member states without a derogation, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Central Bank, adopted a Council regulation irrevocably fixing the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the member states adopting the euro. The conversion rate for the Irish pound was fixed at 1 euro equals £0.787564 Irish pounds.</P>
      <P>In my speech at the Council meeting, I confirmed Ireland's endorsement of the Commission proposal and welcomed the fact that the long-standing objective of economic and monetary union was now finally being realised. I also referred to the prospective significant benefits to the Irish economy which membership of the euro area offers, and which is widely recognised to be in our long-term interest, while noting the fact that membership will bring challenges as well as opportunities. Finally, I noted that Ireland was entering EMU in good condition and was well placed to participate successfully, and that this country was looking forward with confidence to the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.</P>
      <P>At the same time as the Council meeting was being held in Brussels, a reception was held in Leinster House to mark Ireland's entry into EMU, the launch of the euro and the announcement of the conversion rate for the euro. Members of the Oireachtas, Ireland's members of the European Parliament and the social partners were invited. The reception was hosted by the Taoiseach. Those attending the reception were given an information pack, copies of which were sent afterwards to all Members of the Oireachtas, on preparations for the changeover to the euro, including information on the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland's, ECBI, public information programme and the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign.</P>
      <P>In addition, a media event was held in the Central Bank on 1 January 1999. It involved a display of the Irish pound's conversion rate against the euro and was attended by the Taoiseach, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Chairperson of the ECBI. A further media event was held on 4 January 1999 at the Irish Stock Exchange, involving the chairman of the Stock Exchange and the chairperson of the ECBI, to mark the start of trading in euro on the Exchange. I was unable to attend either of these events myself because of illness.</P>
      <P>Finally, on 12 January 1999, I launched the third phase of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland's public information programme. As part of the third phase, an advertising campaign &ndash; involving television and national and local press and radio as well as outdoor advertising &ndash; was run in January 1999 and an information leaflet is being delivered to every household in the country.</P>

      <P>From 1973 to 1998, inclusive, Ireland has received a net amount of IR£23,344.4 million from the EU. The details are set out in Table A which follows.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question is presumed to refer to the 1994-1999 Community Support Framework, the 1989-1993 Community Support Framework and pre-1989 receipts, no &ldquo;rounds&rdquo;, as such, existed prior to 1989. The details are set out in Table B which follows. It should be noted that since 1993, Ireland has also received IR£722.59 million from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>As regards the likely level of EU funds Ireland may receive in the future from the enlarged European Union, the Deputy will be aware that the Agenda 2000 negotiations relating to the overall financing and expenditure of the EU in the coming round, 2000-06, are yet to be decided in the negotiations currently under way, and are due to be settled by the end of March next. I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of these negotiations at this point. The incorporation of new member states in an enlarged Union is not due to commence at least until some years after 2000 and it is too soon to judge the effect of such enlargement on Ireland's level of receipts beyond that point.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with public financial procedures, my Department has neither employers nor public liability insurance in relation to these matters. It is the practice for the Exchequer to carry its own insurance.</P>
      <P>However, I, as Minister for Finance, am the owner of some of the State property on which mobile phone transmitters are located. Owners of other such properties are the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has an agreement with a mobile telephone provider in relation to access to and the use of certain Garda premises for the purpose of erecting certain telecommunications masts. The terms of this agreement include an indemnification of the State against all actions, proceedings, etc. arising from the operation of the mobile telephone service and the installation and operation of mobile telephony antennae and ancillary equipment on any Garda premises. Specifically the mobile telephone provider is required to take out public liability insurance, which in the opinion of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland is adequate to cover any <Col N="429" /> claim arising from any action taken against the State in relation to the operation of the mobile telephone service and the installation and operation of mobile telephony antennae and ancillary equipment on any Garda premises.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Vienna EMF resolution, I understand that this has proven to be controversial among the scientific community as the bulk of the research on the issue of non-ionising radiation has not shown any of the effects claimed by the resolution.</P>

      <P>The most recent international meeting at which I spoke on this issue was that of the international Monetary Fund and World Bank in October 1998, which took place in Washington.</P>
      <P>In my speech to the meeting, I stressed that the IMF and World Bank should seek to ensure that debt relief measures take full account of the social dimension, embrace widespread consultation in the countries in question, and encourage sustainable economic development.</P>
      <P>I also argued for greater flexibility in the implementation of the joint IMF/World Bank HIPCs Initiative, as well as speedier implementation and application to as wide a range of the heavily indebted poor countries as possible. I pointed out that definitions of debt sustainability should be broadened to take human, as well as economic development into account and that the two recent evaluations of the ESAF facility make clear the need for the IMF to take full account of the social impact of policies in the design and implementation phases of macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes. I believe that the most vulnerable sections of the community must be afforded special consideration, with safeguards against the most severe consequences of structural adjustment policies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Third World debt relief package which the Government adopted last September and which are now the subject of the debate before this Dáil on the passage of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1998. The measures in this Bill will allow Ireland to move from its advocacy role in relation to debt relief and become a direct contributor to the HIPC initiative. They will give Ministers increased moral authority to call for increased efforts by the international community to reduce the burden of debt on Third World countries to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level, the most recent initiative on debt relief was the package of proposals announced by German Chancellor Schröder in Cologne earlier this year. It represents a major move forward by <Col N="430" /> the German Government of the debt relief issue. The package embraces a proposal for debt cancellation in regard to bilateral aid and commercial debts in the Paris Club. Ireland takes a positive attitude towards the package.</P>
    <P>There is now clear evidence that the international community is actively engaging in the debt cancellation debate and is prepared to move forward from strongly held positions of the past.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to press the international community, the IMF and the World Bank to provide the deepest possible level of debt relief to HIPC's countries who are prepared to engage in appropriate economic and social reform programmes. It must, however, be recognised that the degree of funding to be provided by donors is the critical determinant of the level of debt relief that will be made available in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 20 February 1999 the G-7 group of countries stressed the importance of improving the HIPC debt initiative and discussed proposals from a number of G-7 partners for achieving this, for example by reviewing the duration and the criteria for debt reduction. We very much welcome these proposals.</P>

      <P>Work on the preparation of the revised estimates for public services and the public capital programme is well advanced. The effect of all decisions leading to changes in the 1999 Estimates which have arisen since the budget, as well as changes arising due to estimating or technical factors, will be included in these documents which I plan to publish around the middle of March. The allocations in the revised Estimates will be based on the Goven<Col N="431" /> ment's 4 per cent limit for the growth in net current expenditure.</P>
      <P>Since the budget on 2 December 1998, a number of additional expenditure pressures have emerged, many of which have arisen due to estimating or technical factors. Where the Government has taken decisions involving additional costs, for example, in the case of the additional aid package to deal with fodder difficulties in agriculture, it has sought, in so far as possible, to identify savings to offset these additional costs in whole or in part.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor the position on 1999 expenditure closely during the year. The Government will aim to ensure that additional costs which may arise are met within the allocations provided for in the 1999 revised Estimates.</P>

      <P>Offshore accounts are a problem for Revenue authorities world-wide. An indication of the scale of the problem is a recent euromoney report which suggested that some $US2.1 trillion in assets were managed by offshore banks.</P>
      <P>The liberalisation and globalisation of capital movements, the increase in the number of &ldquo;tax havens&rdquo;, of which there are now more than 40, and the development of electronic banking means that funds can now be transferred to and from an offshore account at the stroke of a keyboard &ndash; with little enough risk of discovery by the home country's tax authorities.</P>
      <P>From the visit that officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners undertook last year to other Revenue authorities to review their access to bank accounts the consensus was that unilateral action which any country might take to address offshore accounts would not significantly improve the ability of the authorities to deter evasion. All countries held the view that further advances in this area could only be made through international co-operation. The proposed EU directive on savings was viewed as a possible way forward.</P>
      <P>Whereas no specific measures have been included in the Finance Bill, as published, to address offshore accounts, one of the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry, with Mr. Justice Michael Moriarty as sole member, is as follows for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in tax laws should be made to achieve this end.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The most recent international meeting at which I spoke on this issue was that of the International</P>
      <P>Monetary Fund and World Bank in October 1998, which took place in Washington. The following is a copy of my speech to meeting, in which I proposed that the IMF and other international financial institutions adopt a strategic response and an appropriate mix of short and long-term measures to deal with the present difficulties affecting the world economy. I assured the meeting that Ireland will work closely with the IMF, the World Bank, and our international partners, to ensure that these institutions have the appropriate resources and develop the necessary strategies to address the challenges facing the global economy in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>I attended meetings of the EU Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, 18 January 1999 and on 8 February 1999. I also attended meetings of the &ldquo;Euro 11&rdquo;, that is the Economic and Finance Ministers of the euro area member states which took place on the same dates.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 28 and 29 on today's Order Paper, in which I reported on the discussions which took place at those meetings.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Statement by Mr. Charlie McCreevy, T.D.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Minister for Finance, Ireland</P>
      <P>The past year has been exceptionally difficult and demanding for both the Bank and the Fund with the continuing difficulties due to the East Asian crisis, and new pressures arising from events in Russia and other emerging market economies. The fallout from these crises threatens the progress which we have made on development and poverty reduction over the past two decades. In an increasingly integrated world the effects of these events have spread beyond the countries and regions concerned. It is imperative therefore, that the international financial institutions redouble their efforts to bring stability to the global financial and monetary system, so that producers and investors can be confident of a return to normal trading and investment patterns. Resolving the difficulties in Russia, reviving growth in South East Asia and minimising contagion effects are all vital ingredients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present difficulties demand a strategic response and an appropriate mix of short and long-term measures. Ireland will work closely <Col N="433" /> with the IMF and World Bank, and our international partners, to ensure that these institutions have the appropriate resources and develop the necessary strategies to address the challenges facing the global economy in the 21st century. It is clear that the IMF must continue to play a critical role at the centre of the international monetary system. Its role in crisis prevention should however be strengthened. The early implementation of the IMF quota increase as well as the establishment of the New Arrangement to Borrow now assume even greater importance. I am glad to report that Ireland has already consented to the increase in its quota under the 11th review.</P>
    <P>It is now recognised by all that the key to economic and financial stability, both domestically and internationally, is the pursuit of policies based on price stability and balanced budgets, in an open market economy which favours an efficient allocation of resources. Sound policies will recognise a number of core principles:</P>
    <P>The most vulnerable groups in society must be protected, to the best extent possible, in times of economic turmoil and financial turbulence;</P>
    <P>The private sector must bear its fair share of the overall burden of adjustment in support of strong economic reforms for countries in economic difficulty;</P>
    <P>Transparency of information and in decision-making is a key element in efficient economic management.</P>
    <P>The urgent attention which these present crises demand should not deflect us from parallel consideration of the enormity of the challenges facing under-developed countries. The eradication of poverty and the integration of Africa into the world economic, financial and trading systems should remain central to all our concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Policy on Third World Debt</i>I welcome the emphasis which the Fund and the Bank are continuing to give to the problem of Third World debt. The Irish Government fully supports the efforts to bring the deepest possible level of debt relief to the poorest countries. My Government has recently adopted a set of principles which will govern Ireland's policy towards Third World debt. In brief, the principles seek to ensure that debt relief measures take full account of the social dimension, embrace widespread consultation in the countries in question, and encourage sustainable economic development.</P>
    <P>Debt relief strategies must become an integral part of overall development policy. They must reinforce the existing emphasis on the fundamental goal of poverty alleviation, as well as environmental sustainability and gender equality. Ireland is a strong supporter of the HIPC Debt Initiative and welcomes the openness and flexibility which all partners have brought to the process. Progress under the Debt Initiative has been significant but there is a strong case for further flexibility in its <Col N="434" /> implementation. Speedier implementation, and application to as wide a range of the heavily indebted poor countries as possible must be key goals. Definitions of debt sustainability should be broadened to take human, as well as economic, development into account. The two recent evaluations of the ESAF Facility emphasise the need for the IMF to take full account of the social impact of policies in the design and implementation phases of macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes. The most vulnerable sections of the community must be afforded special consideration, with safeguards against the most severe consequences of structural adjustment policies.</P>
    <P>In calling for deeper debt relief and wider and speedier application of the debt initiative my Government has decided to provide £11 million to the World Bank's HIPC Trust, and also to provide £4 million to the IMF's ESAF/HIPC Trust. These resources are additional to £9.5 million that has already been committed by Ireland to Mozambique and Tanzania for debt relief.</P>
    <P>In the context of this major debt relief package, Ireland will make its proposed contribution of £7 million to ESAF. The need for reform of certain aspects of ESAF programs is clear, and I am encouraged by the positive response of the IMF to the external evaluation of the Facility. We must ensure that the lessons of the external review increasingly influence the planning, design and implementation of ESAF programmes.</P>
    <P>I encourage the international community, including bilateral creditors to take an even more generous and flexible approach to the heavily indebted poor countries. Deeper debt relief is a prerequisite to integrating the poorest countries into the global economy.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the recent trend in both the Bank and the IMF to involve civil society in the developing countries more fully in the planning, design and implementation phases of IMF/World Bank programmes. Successful implementation of programs will also be facilitated through greater transparency in the workings of the Bretton Woods Institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Summary</i>We must all recognise that the Bretton Woods Institutions have, since their establishment, served the international community well. Their record of achievement has been outstanding. Recent crises have raised awareness of how vulnerable emerging economies can be in the face of sudden shocks. The Irish Government looks forward to working with the Fund and the Bank in strengthening the architecture of the international monetary system, and especially, helping to resolve the problems of the most heavily indebted poor countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997 to apply parity with a floor of 3 per cent to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Initially, there were difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines should be applied to certain groups of pensioners, particularly in the local authority and health board areas. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department along with other Departments made every effort to ensure that public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision. The issues now being pursued by certain pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy. For example, some pensioners want personal long service increments paid to certain serving staff under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel. My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale. This was one of the key criteria set out in the guidelines issued to Departments.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not see a case for the appointment of an arbitrator to adjudicate on pensions parity issues. I would point out that superannuation matters are not arbitrable for serving staff under the terms of Public Service Conciliation and Arbitration Schemes.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, are being introduced in a co-operative manner with pre-school providers. Where deficiencies are identified, providers are given a specific period of time in which to make specific improvements provided that the delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to stimulate the supply of childcare places, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement on 2 December 1998, announced that capital allowances are being introduced for expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, refurbishment and extension of a crèche or nursery. The expenditure can be written off over seven years at 15 per cent per annum for the first six years, and 10 per cent in year seven.</P>

      <P>Section 27 of the Birth and Deaths Registration Act, (Ireland), 1880 provides for the correction of errors in the registers of births and deaths, including errors of fact or substance. Errors of fact or substance may be corrected by the officer having custody of the register (i.e. the Registrar or Superintendent Registrar) on payment of the statutory fee and upon production of a statutory declaration setting forth the nature of the error and the true facts of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I understand that there may be a number of issues to be addressed in relation to an application for the amendment of a birth entry. I <Col N="439" /> also understand that, in the case of an entry signed by the party denying paternity, who subsequently seeks to have his name removed from the Register of Births, it may not be sufficient to amend the original entry as described above. There are also legal difficulties associated with the subsequent inclusion of the details of the putative father, in circumstances where a father was named in the original entry.</P>
    <P>The details given by the Deputy are not sufficient to enable me to formulate a more helpful answer.

      <P>The authorities at Beaumont Hospital have advised me that one of the hospital's theatres is closed at present due to a shortage of nursing staff and a second theatre is operating on a part-time basis. I understand there are 14 vacant posts at present in the hospital's operating theatres but that they are making every effort to recruit the appropriate staff. The hospital's authorities have further advised me that their other operating theatres function on a 24 hour basis and that no neurosurgical cases have been deferred as a result of a shortage of specialist nursing staff. I am assured that all emergency and urgent cases are treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of nurse shortages is an issue which has become more apparent in recent times. While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under <Col N="440" /> review by the Health Service Employers' Agency (HSEA). The HSEA established a task force in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I launched the competitions for places on this year's nursing diploma programmes on 20 January 1999. I also announced an increased annual maintenance grant of £3,250 payable to nursing students and the provision of funding of £350,000 to An Bord Altranais (which now manages the Nursing Careers Centre) and various schools of nursing for a recruitment campaign, at both national and local level, aimed at attracting more young people to enter nursing.</P>
    <P>The closing date for applications for nurse training was last Friday, 19 February. I am pleased to note that approximately 6,000 applications have been received which represents a 50 per cent increase on 1998. I am hopeful that a full uptake of all the available training places will result from this increased level of interest.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that Ireland is not in a unique position in relation to the shortage of nurses. The reality is that the United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Nurses with specialist qualifications in areas such as cardiac care are particularly sought after.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the task force, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad. The response of the nursing unions to these measures has been positive. In addition, the HSEA has agreed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. The HSEA expects to be in a position to announce details of this scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the difficulties being experienced by hospitals in recruiting nurses, it should be noted that my Department engaged a nurse researcher in late 1998 to specifically study nursing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons why nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Labour Court recently recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas, including theatre and intensive care, and who hold special qualifications. The court also accepted that there are grounds for improvements in the pay of ward sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the report of the Commission on Nursing and recommended that the parties enter into discussions immediately on <Col N="441" /> implementation of that report, those discussions to be completed by 1 May 1999 at which stage the parties are to report back to the court.</P>
    <P>I announced on 10 February that the Government was prepared to accept the Labour Court recommendations. The Deputy will be aware that discussions between the HSEA and the nursing unions began last week. I am confident that the process which is now under way provides a way forward for implementing the report of the Commission on Nursing which sets out a coherent framework for the future development of the nursing profession and contains a large number of wide-ranging recommendations designed to address the real underlying problems within nursing.</P>

      <P>The shared ownership scheme, which is administered by local authorities, offers home ownership in a number of steps to those who cannot afford full ownership in one step in the traditional way. Under the scheme, the local authority acquires the house selected by the shared owner, who must purchase at least a 40 per cent share in the house and pay rent, at 4.5 per cent for transactions entered into on or after 1 May 1998, on the remainder. The 40 per cent share will normally be funded by way of the required deposit of £1,000 and a mortgage loan from the local authority, but cash may be contributed if the applicant is in a position to do so. The remaining equity must be acquired within 25 years at the original value updated in line with the consumer price index. A graduated rent subsidy is payable under the scheme where the household income is below a specified amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the scheme were improved in November 1997 and again in April 1998 in the context of the Government's action on house prices. These changes were designed to improve affordability under the scheme by increasing the income eligibility limit and the level of rent subsidy. The income eligibility limit was increased to £20,000 for a single income household with appropriate increases for two income households. These changes have increased significantly the range of purchasers and houses to which the <Col N="444" /> scheme applies. I am keeping the terms of the scheme under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> Under the devolved rural water programme a group water scheme may only be taken over by a local authority with the agreement of the group itself. While I am not aware of the instances referred to by the Deputy, customer and district meters are a useful management tool and help to monitor and conserve water usage. Grants are payable to groups for providing them in new schemes or as part of an improvement project and they may also be funded as part of the cost of upgrading a scheme prior to being taken in charge by a local authority.</P>
    <P>The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, which is representative of local authorities, the group scheme sector and my own Department, was set up last year to advise on policy and to monitor implementation, by local authorities, of the devolved programme. Local committees have also been established at county level which mirror the activities of the national committee and provide a forum for resolving any local issues that may arise in relation to the rural water programme, such as the question of metering group consumers.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 297, 298 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to eligible people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a value for money study into the administration of SWA in 1998 and found widespread agreement that SWA housing supplements should not be administered by the health boards as part of SWA. An inter-departmental committee, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is currently examining the implications of transferring the administration of SWA housing supplements to the local authorities. The work of the committee is well advanced and I understand that its report is expected to be finalised and presented to Government in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in Ireland aged 66 years or over and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. From April 1999, the scheme will be available to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, on the main public and private transport services to those who are qualified and who are living permanently in Ireland. At the end of December 1998, over 530,000 free travel passes had been issued at an annual cost of £32.6 million.</P>
      <P>The scheme was extended in 1995 to cover cross-Border travel only, between Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is available to passholders in Ireland, their spouses or companions in the case of people holding companion passes, and to Northern Ireland concession travel passholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> The free travel scheme, as in the case of other social welfare schemes in Ireland, is available to all eligible persons irrespective of nationality. It would not be possible to extend the scheme to Irish nationals resident in Britain as this would be contrary to EU law, which in many instances prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality. This would mean, therefore, that if the scheme were to be extended on the lines suggested, it would have to be extended to all pensioners who are EU nationals coming to Ireland for temporary stays.</P>
    <P>Extending the free travel scheme to all retired citizens of the European Union visiting Ireland would have policy, cost and administrative implications bearing in mind that the scheme is based on spare seating capacity being available on public transport during off-peak hours only.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte estimates that approximately 230,000 EU citizens over the age of 65 visited Ireland in 1997. Of this number, approximately 120,000 did not use a car or private coach during their stay. It is not possible to estimate the take-up of the travel facility by this group and hence the cost but it is clear that it could be significant.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the Deputy's proposal will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. Payment may continue in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. Payments to asylum seekers are made on the same basis as payments to other recipients and weekly socialising payments are not made.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on SWA payments to asylum seekers was approximately £22 million in 1998 and £12 million in 1997.</P>

      <P>My Department, in accordance with public financial procedures, does not have employers or public liability insurance. The basis for this position is set out in the public financial procedures as follows:</P>
      <P>The general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose, would fall wholly and directly on public funds. This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as materially to disturb the financial position of the year so that it is cheaper in the long-term for the Exchequer to carry its own insurance.</P>

The investigation is still in progress, and all information is fully investigated.

The investigating officer is satisfied that, based on the evidence available to date, all areas and lands required to be searched have been subject to comprehensive searching.</P>

    <P>The report entitled A Review of the Operation of VEC Outdoor Education Centres in Ireland was presented to me on 12 January 1999. The <Col N="458" /> report is being considered in my Department in regard to the development of future policies relating to Vocational Education Committee outdoor education centres. The issues raised by the Deputy are being considered in this context.</P>
    <P>The report is generally available on request from my Department and copies are currently being distributed. The detailed information about the operation of outdoor education centres, which has been requested, is contained in this report which has now been furnished to the Deputy. Details of grant assistance to vocational education committees in respect of the nine approved VEC outdoor education centres for the past ten years as requested are set out in the following tabular format.</P>

The expansion of provision is one of my priorities as Minister. On Thursday, 11 February, I announced Government approval for the establishment this year of a national educational psychological service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase. At the end of the five-year period, it is envisaged that every school in the country will have access to a schools psychological service.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. A detailed analysis is currently being made of the needs and resources available in each county in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service. Information about schools in all parts of the country, including County Kildare, will be taken into account in setting the priorities.</P>

      <P>The increases due under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  to holders of posts of responsibility were finally agreed in early 1998. My Department notified vocational educational committees of the arrangements under which these increases would be payable to serving teachers in April 1998. In order to qualify for payment, it was necessary for teachers to confirm that they were prepared to carry out the duties associated with the newly-designated posts. Teachers were given until 30 September 1998 to give an undertaking to carry out the required duties.</P>
      <P>Following notification of the responses to my Department vocational education committees were authorised to pay the increases to serving teachers. They were authorised to pay the increases to retired teachers by circular issued on 2 December 1998. It was emphasised that an increase was payable, without the need for an undertaking, to all retired teachers who held posts of responsibility during service and who had retired prior to 1 September 1998, the beginning of the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>I should point out that my Department has regulatory responsibility for the pensions of vocational teachers but that the pension of any individual teacher is calculated by the relevant vocational education committee. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, my Department's pensions unit in Athlone will be glad to look into the matter if he will give them the details.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a clear precedent was established in 1970 and 1971 where his Department agreed to pay teachers, who had already retired, the benefit in their pensions of allowances which they never held during their own service.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the PCW agreement provides that the long service allowance is payable in the pay of eligible teachers who are in service on or after 1 August 1996. Since it is an allowance, rather than an increase in incremental salary, it is not payable in the pensions of teachers who retired prior to that date.</P>
      <P>It has been contended that the long service allowance should be regarded as an increment in salary. It has also been contended, and the Deputy has referred to this, that there is a precedent for paying the allowance to teachers who retired prior to 1 August 1996 on the grounds that, in 1971, retired teachers received the benefits of post of responsibility allowances which they did not hold during service.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the contention that the long service allowance should be regarded as an increment is that, under the restructuring pay deals, this payment was specifically agreed as an allowance. Because allowances may be pensionable or otherwise, the agreement specifically provides that &ldquo;in the case of teachers retiring whilst in receipt of the allowance, the allowance would be reckonable towards superannuation entitlements subject to the normal averaging arrangements&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the precedent cited in the case of post of responsibility allowances is that these allowances were introduced, in the early 1970s, with retrospective effect. As in the case of the long service allowance, however, teachers who had retired prior to the agreed effective date of establishment of the post of responsibility allowances did not receive the benefit of those allowances. Specifically, no teacher who retired prior to 1 July 1968, the earliest agreed effective date, received the benefit of the allowance.</P>

      <P>The four designated integrated service project areas are: Dublin North-East inner city, Dublin canal communities &ndash; St Teresas Gardens, St Micheals Estate, Dolphin House, Fatima Mansions &ndash; Jobstown, County Dublin and Togher, Cork.</P>
      <P>A national co-ordinator has been appointed who is based in ADM in addition to four development and monitoring officers. I have assigned Department officials to each of designated areas who will work on an implementation team representative of all Government and statutory agencies in consultation with the local communities and the development and monitoring officer. An induction seminar was held yesterday 24 February to brief all Government and state agency personnel assigned to work on this initiative.</P>
      <P>The initiative is intended to address a hierarchy of needs including housing and environment, social order, community development, health, childcare, education, recreation, youth initiatives, training and employment. In my view, co-ordination of all state services and agencies in addressing needs is the crucial first step in optimising the benefits of services to families and individuals in these communities and to break the traditional intergenerational cycle of disadvantage. The way in which resources are deployed is as important as the level of resources available to State agencies. Research has shown that those most at risk of not benefiting from the system are the children of the unemployed or the children of early school leavers. Educational achievement therefore both initial and second chance, is a key issue to be addressed within the overall strategy. Until the implementation team is fully operational on the ground it is not possible to predict the level of additional resources, if any, which will be required in the designated areas. I am fully committed to the concept of integrated services initiatives and I assure the Deputy that the issue of resources will be addressed as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Ongoing monitoring of the initiative will be undertaken by the development and monitoring officer at local level in conjunction with the implementation team for each area. It will probably be the end of this year or early next year before the interdepartmental committee on local development will be in a position to consider lessons from the first phase of the project.</P>
