      <P>I ask that the Business of the House be suspended to allow time for a debate on the European Commission's criticism of the Government's failure to put in place decentralised regional structures and that these structures be put in place immediately after and not before consultation with the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 3, the Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and No. 4, the Road Transport Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. Private Members' Business will be No. 69, motion re housing (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter arising from yesterday's Order of Business. Since the Taoiseach spoke yesterday about punishment beatings, the Chief Constable of the RUC, Mr. Flanagan, stated that he is satisfied that punishment beatings are not being carried out by individuals acting on their own but by paramilitary organisations deciding matters centrally. Will the Taoiseach confirm that those currently involved in the commission of punishment beatings, if brought before the courts, will in no circumstance benefit from early release provisions which are currently being applied to those who committed offences before the British-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted what the Chief Constable of the RUC stated last night. It was helpful to clear up the great degree of confusion about who precisely is behind punishment beatings. There have been many articles and debates since Christmas, particularly in west and east Belfast, <Col N="1158" /> regarding these matters. Anyone involved in any of these activities, or in any other criminal activities, be they armed or unarmed, since the British-Irish Agreement cannot be beneficiaries of its early release provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that we are just two months away from the first anniversary of the British-Irish Agreement and that the Government, irrespective of difficulties which may arise elsewhere, is obliged to introduce three Bills. Legislation establishing the human rights commission has been promised by the Taoiseach. Indeed, before Christmas he promised the heads of the Bill would be discussed with one of the relevant committees of the House before the final draft was completed. In view of the fact that Northern Ireland has established its commission and appointed a chief executive, will the Taoiseach tell the House what the problem or difficulty is in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned some matters relating to this yesterday. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform circulated the draft heads of the Bill to Departments and the Office of the Attorney General on 3 December with a request for observations to be returned by 16 December. It was hoped the draft heads would be approved at the final meeting on 21 December. Before Christmas I stated that was the position, but it was not possible to meet that objective. The heads are currently being revised to take account of the ministerial and departmental comments and the advice of the Attorney General. It is hoped approval of the proposals will be cleared next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the Taoiseach's original indication that he was prepared to circulate the heads of the Bill in advance will now not necessarily apply, that he will proceed next week to sign off on the Bill as such and that he will then proceed to drafting? What is the Taoiseach's intention in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a parallel process, as I hope that if the heads are cleared by the Government next week they will immediately go before a committee of the House, as I originally stated to Deputy McManus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do things stand in relation to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which is the second of three Bills we are supposed to implement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bill will hopefully be available shortly. Yesterday I stated it would be ready this session, but we are trying to speed it up as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the £200,000 awarded by the courts last week in a compensation case, introducing another category of compensation <Col N="1159" /> claim in relation to the Defence Forces, and in view of the reported meeting between senior members of the Judiciary and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to express concern about the constant commentary on those cases, is the Government considering introducing legislation to deal with the escalating compensation? When will the legislation concerning the State claims agency be brought forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no proposed legislation concerning defence, but the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill is expected to be introduced in early summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

Cathain a thabharfar an Bille seo isteach? An bhfuil an Taoiseach sásta gurb é Príomh-Fheidhmeannach Bhord na Gaeilge a d'fhógair an Bille seo le déanaí?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about the disabilities Bill and he said he would get back to me. Does he have any further information on it? It sends out the wrong signal if he is not giving any priority to this Bill? On the regional authorities structures, will we get an opportunity to discuss this in the House? It is extremely important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the national disabilities Bill, I told Deputy Gormley I would try to get a more up to date indication from the Department, which I have not got. It was given priority and I hope the date will be better than that I gave yesterday, but I will come back to him with a firm date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On motion 67 in my name, that of Deputy Dukes and Deputy Olivia Mitchell and the proposed legislation on taxis, will the Taoiseach say when provisions will be made to allow taxi sharing to go ahead in Dublin as proposed by taxi drivers, at least on a pilot basis, including provisions to protect those sharing taxis? This is a matter of some urgency because people are still finding it very difficult to obtain taxis at certain points during the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there is a requirement for legislation. The Deputy asked if it was possible to introduce a pilot scheme. I do not know if that requires any regulatory change, <Col N="1161" /> but I will ask. I do not imagine it does. I believe it is an agreement between the local authorities&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach look into the matter and perhaps drop me a line? I was of the belief that it required legislation and that it was on the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask two small questions which may be answered very directly? When will the broadcasting Bill be published? Yesterday the Taoiseach informed the House that amending legislation to the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act would be brought forward before March?  Maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo, an mbeidh athruithe ar theorainneacha na Gaeltachta?  The Minister of State, who used to be very dedicated as regards changing the boundaries of the Gaeltacht, promised they would be drawn up and changed before the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill was introduced. Will there be changes in the legislation, which is necessary, so that the elections may take place on the day the Taoiseach indicated last week? Will the boundaries of the Gaeltacht be changed in the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss changes in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach said the Údáras na Gaeltachta elections would be on the same day as the European and local government elections. That is not legally possible and the Act must be changed, as he admitted yesterday. Does the legislation, which will allow the elections to take place on the same day, include changes to the boundaries of the Gaeltacht? It is very difficult to get a straight answer from the Aire Stáit with responsibility for this area, but perhaps the Taoiseach might have extracted it. My first question related to the senior Minister. When will the long awaited broadcasting Bill be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The broadcasting Bill will be introduced in this session, probably in March. The Aire Stáit told me the Údáras na Gaeltachta Bill will be introduced in March and will deal with the issues the Deputy raised.</P>

        <b>:</b> There should be no need for a family conference on this matter. There is a specific commitment in the programme for Government as regards the establishment of special drugs courts. Will special legislation be required? We have had regular reports every three months that it is on the way but 20 months later we have not yet seen it. Is special legislation required? Will special powers and extra judges be assigned to those courts? When may we expect to see the legislation, if it is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe legislation is a requirement but the Minister has said that legislative proposals may arise in the future as a result of the decision in relation to the establishment of a drugs courts planning committee to initiate a drugs courts planning programme. In the meantime, it is being set up on a pilot basis which might not be satisfactory in the long-term.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for accepting my reason in that fashion. Detailed notes will be taken of the various points Members put forward but I hope the debate will not end today. I understand it will continue this week and into next week, if the Whips so arrange.</P>
      <P>The Bill I am introducing today is the first vital step in the process of liberalisation of the electricity sector which begins to take effect from February 2000. From that date, 28 per cent of the Irish market will be open to competition. It will herald a new dawn for Ireland as we face into the next century. Electricity forms such a vital component of our overall energy needs &ndash; how we manage the sector and cope with dramatic growth will have a major bearing on our future prosperity and development.</P>
      <P>The Bill complements the major changes which have taken place within the ESB and the wider European electricity market over recent years. It will establish a stable regulatory regime for the future development of this economically vital sector.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998, is a first vital step in the process of liberalisation. The picture emerging is one of liberalisation leading to a progressive opening up of the electricity market to competition; increased efficiency; downward pressure on prices; strong independent but accountable regulation in both the electricity and gas sectors; and increased use of sustainable energy resources. The Bill will be the most important item of legislation in relation to the electricity industry in Ireland since the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, which established the ESB.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a new regulatory body in Ireland which will be grandly called the Commission for Electricity Regulation &ndash; I would prefer to call the person the regulator. This follows EU Directive 96/92, under which Ireland is scheduled to introduce competition in the electricity industry by February 2000. There will be one commissioner initially, but the Bill will enable the commission to be expanded to whatever is required in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission, which will be funded by the industry, will exercise its functions under a range of primary and secondary duties, focusing on the protection of the interests of final customers and ensuring non-discrimination between electricity undertakings. These duties will include promoting competition; securing that all reasonable demands for electricity are met; promoting safety, efficiency and economy by electricity undertakings; and taking account of the protection of the environment. The commission will also be given the power, currently resting with the ESB, to licence the generation and supply of electricity, <Col N="1166" /> and to authorise the construction of electricity generating stations.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission recently completed the open competition for the post of commissioner and I inform the House that the commission recommended Mr. Tom Reeves, an assistant secretary in my Department, for appointment as commissioner. I will be formally appointing Tom Reeves as soon as the Bill has been enacted. He is in waiting to be the regulator. Tom Reeves has already started the preparatory work necessary for the speedy commencement of the commission's functions. I wish him well in his new role. He has served the country well in another guise as a public servant and will now be the regulator for the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to look back briefly at the proud history of the ESB, a company that has served, and continues to serve, this country with distinction. We have come a long way since the first electric light was switched on at Prince's Street in Dublin in 1880. It was only with the advent of the Shannon-Ardnacrusha scheme &ndash; then one of the most advanced in the world &ndash; that we had enough power for everyone. We had three times the generating capacity demanded at the time. This was mainly because demand in Ireland was so low, much lower than comparable European levels.</P>
    <P>Men of vision shaped the development and expansion of the electricity sector. We were fortunate in having some of the most determined, vigorous and able minds at our disposal in the persons of Dr. Thomas McLoughlin, a young Irish engineer working in Germany who later became Chairman of the board, and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Patrick McGilligan.</P>
    <P>After the establishment of the ESB in 1927, progress followed quickly. New generating capacity was provided by a plant in Cork and the Liffey in Dublin and the development by Bord na Mona of our bogs provided increased generating capacity.</P>
    <P>One of the largest tasks facing the ESB was rural electrification. The first rural consumer was switched on in Killsallaghan in 1946 and the scheme was finally completed in the mid-1970s. The famous book about that, <i>The Gentle Revolution</i>, described how the men toiled in adverse conditions, as they still do. The task of climbing poles in all weathers is still the same and it is undertaken with commitment and a sense of purpose by ESB workers. During the winter storms and for the second year in succession, the crews were unable to celebrate Christmas and the new year because they were working. The innovative and inspired scheme of rural electrification transformed the country and laid the foundations for much of today's economic growth. As the economy expanded, the demand for electricity increased. In meeting this demand, the ESB was constantly at the forefront of economic development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the ESB as a publicly controlled monopoly in 1927 was seen at the time <Col N="1167" /> as the most pragmatic approach in the prevailing circumstances. However, the world has not stood still, not that anyone would want it to. The circumstances in which we now find ourselves are those of rapid change, competition, market forces and European law. It is clear the electricity industry must change to meet the challenges of these new circumstances. Current market and global developments mean the introduction of competition, and independent regulation in the electricity industry is inevitable. From the ESB's point of view, its history has shown it to be more than willing and capable of meeting this challenge head on and of succeeding.</P>
    <P>The onset of competition is not just for the ESB, nor is it just a challenge. It is also a huge opportunity. The ESB will be able to compete in the entire EU market for the generation and supply of electricity. Its experience from competing for consultancies through ESB International and its involvement in the liberalised telecommunications sector through Ocean will prove valuable in this regard. I noted Deputy Yates's comment at a recent committee meeting that the ESB was interested in competition in the telecommunications market. I am pleased it has chosen to grasp the concept of change and competition with both hands. The ESB's latest annual report states that the company is &ldquo;...pursuing a focused growth strategy...designed to ensure that ESB is fully prepared for open competition in the home market...and...in expanding its horizons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Competition has been successfully introduced into two areas where State-owned companies had a monopoly: the aviation and telecommunications sectors. Deputy Stagg introduced the legislation allowing Telecom Éireann to have a strategic partner and the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition Government introduced the legislation for Aer Lingus. There is no doubt that Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus underwent a certain amount of trauma in the transition to a more market-driven business. However, no one would doubt that it has proven beneficial to both companies and, more importantly, to consumers.</P>
    <P>It is clear the ESB has always had a very forward-looking and progressive view of both its own development and that of the electricity industry. It has involved itself heavily in consultancy work and there is no country on the globe which has not been touched by the work of ESB International. It has tendered for and won consultancies in both wealthy countries and those which are struggling to develop and create a more modern regime. I pay a huge tribute to its work. Clearly it has had an effect on the main range of ESB activities in that it promotes a sense of adventure. Adventure lay at the core of the establishment of the ESB. Thomas McLoughlin, Patrick McGilligan and others in the then Cabinet were men of vision and adventure. If that spirit of adventure could be grasped and developed, the ESB would be second to none in the competitive environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> We are also aware of the ESB's innovative approach to industrial relations and its recent involvement with British Telecom, to which I referred earlier. I was interested when it became involved with BT in Ocean, which seems to be forging ahead, because at the time the strategy was announced, I was having a series of meetings with the ESB and the groups of unions. While I was pleased to hear about it, I found it difficult to talk about competition when clearly there was resistance to it at the time, even though the same company was involving itself in competition in another sphere of activity.</P>
    <P>The ESB has always had regard to the needs of its customers. The rural electrification scheme is a good example, to which I referred earlier, into which the ESB put the full weight of its resources bringing the most far-flung and remote areas in the country into the electricity system. This task was undertaken despite the fact that it would cost a great deal of money, manpower and effort. In doing so, the ESB and successive Governments, the first being the Cumann na nGaedhal Government, saw the enormous joy and comfort electricity brought to those citizens who were being included for the first time in a new, modern Ireland. It was interesting the Department of Finance had its usual mantra of &ldquo;no, no, no&rdquo; when the money was sought by the first Government for expansion and development of the electrification scheme. <i>Plus ça change</i>. The ESB's commitment to customers continues today. The company's new customer charter is indicative of its customer focus. It sets out goals and targets for the ESB to meet.</P>
    <P>The drive to prepare the ESB for the competitive market continues as a top priority and the cost and competitiveness review is a vital part of this process. It is on target in terms of cost savings and staff reductions. It provides for a 5 per cent employee shareholding scheme in return for changes and savings set out. The shareholding is not being offered for cash but in exchange for change under the CCR. The options for the best structure for the ESB in the new competitive era are under review. They are not formally under review but in terms of a State company thinking about its future. There is no shortage of possible options &ndash; strategic alliances, further employee share ownership, public share offerings, disposal, public-private partnership or a combination of those. I will only consider what is best for the ESB, the industry and the consumer, and will not be driven by any specific ideology.</P>
    <P>When the ESB was established, it was on the most pragmatic and practical basis and the same principle will be used now to determine its future development. The CCR demonstrates the ability of the ESB to develop and carry out a major process of change. While it does not seem like anything new today, at the time it was devised it was revolutionary, and that is not so long ago. It came about because the ESB, unions and Government of the day decided to come together knowing that in the future lay competition and the opening up <Col N="1169" /> of the market. They were moving to put their house in order. It was a co-operative process which worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>A significant milestone in electricity generation in Ireland has been the involvement of the Finnish energy group, IVO, in the building of the 120 mw generating station in the east midlands. This welcome development is the first indication of the advent of competition in the electricity generation market in Ireland. Not only will the station be a major boost for employment opportunities, the new plant will bring a major and welcome improvement in the efficiencies of using peat in generating electricity. The electricity sector and the ESB in particular, is strong, vibrant, and well positioned for the challenges of the new era of competition which lies ahead. I know the ESB will face up to this new era with the same spirit and determination it has shown in the past.</P>
    <P>I will give some background to this Bill. The electricity sector is growing by about 6 per cent each year. Indications are that this will continue for some years. To meet demand, the Government has set out, as one of its key priorities, the development of a competitive electricity sector in line with the European Union Electricity Directive 96/92/EC concerning common rules for an internal market in electricity which came into force on 19 February 1997. The position agreed between all member states followed several years of protracted negotiations, was difficult to achieve given the different requirements of the various member states. Ireland secured a derogation of one year and is scheduled to implement the directive in February 2000. I am pleased we are now in a position to implement part of the directive a year earlier by setting up the regulator.</P>
    <P>The directive will allow independent electricity generators to contract directly with eligible customers for the supply of electricity. Eligible customers will be those who will be free to shop around and to choose their electricity supplier in the competitive market. It also provides for the gradual opening up of the electricity market to competition over a six year period with minimum thresholds which will initially cover approximately one quarter of the European market and finally result in one third of the total 45 billion ecu market being compulsorily liberalised.</P>
    <P>This 32 per cent market opening by 2003 is the minimum level that all member states must respect. The Commission encourages member states to open up their markets even further. A clear majority of member states will go beyond the minimum market opening provided for in the directive. Germany, Sweden, Finland, the UK, the Netherlands and Spain either have or are planning a 100 per cent market opening. Denmark will have almost 90 per cent market opening, while Austria will have 50 per cent opening.</P>
    <P>It is evident that at least 60 per cent of the EU electricity demand will be liberalised by the end of 1999. This highlights that the necessity for a <Col N="1170" /> liberalised electricity market is widely recognised. The directive requires the Commission to reconsider the directive in the light of the experience gained in due time to permit further measures for market opening to take effect, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3 contain standard provisions in legislation, i.e., short title, interpretations and laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 4 provides for the mechanism by which any notices to be served or given under this Bill shall be addressed to the person concerned. Sections 5 and 6 provide for the prosecution of offences.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 9 provide for the establishment of the Commission for Electricity Regulation and for the assignment to the commission of its functions, powers and duties. Detailed provisions relating to the commission are contained in the First Schedule to the Bill. Section 9 gives the Minister the power to give directions to the regulator until the scheduled implementation date of the EU Electricity Directive. Sections 10 and 11 provide for the appointment of authorised officers. Section 12 provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information obtained by any person while performing his or her duties for the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the commission to grant licences to the ESB or to other electricity undertakings to generate and supply electricity to eligible customers. This section effectively introduces the competition.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that any person who has been granted a permit after 1 September 1998 by the ESB to generate, distribute and supply electricity shall apply to the regulator within three months of the enactment of this Bill. Any existing permits granted by the ESB after 1 September 1998 will then expire 12 months after enactment of this Bill. Any applications for such permits which are still with the ESB shall be deemed to be an application to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the granting of plant authorisations by the commission. An undertaking would not be permitted to build a generating station without such authorisation. Section 16 makes provision for applications for authorisations. Section 17 gives the Minister the power to specify the criteria for the granting of authorisations. These criteria may relate to the safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the environment, public service obligations, energy efficiency and other matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 allow the regulator to modify any licences or plant authorisations it has granted. Where such modifications are not agreed they can be imposed subject to minimum notice and certain conditions. The regulator may decide to hold a public hearing before reaching its decision. There is also recourse to the appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 set out the way in which the commission may hold public hearings where it considers that representations or objections to proposed modifications to licences or authoris<Col N="1171" /> ations raise matters of sufficient public interest. These sections define the terms under which reports of such hearings will be prepared and how concerned companies or individuals will be informed of the outcome of the hearing.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 to 25 give the commission powers to enforce by direction the conditions of licences or authorisations. The regulator may apply to the High Court for an order to ensure compliance with any direction.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 and 27 define those customers who will be eligible to choose their supplier of electricity from February 2000. Those customers are defined by the level of their electricity usage. This level is set to introduce competition to 28 per cent of the market, increasing to 32 per cent. In line with the Government decision of April 1996, all electricity customers will be entitled to purchase electricity which is produced using a renewable or alternative form of energy as its primary source. The policy decision to change the level of market opening above and beyond that required by the EU directive will remain with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 to 31 provide for the appeals mechanism. Appeal panels may be established to hear and determine appeals regarding applications and modifications. The Minister will determine the membership of appeal panels.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that the ESB shall prepare a grid code or a distribution code for the operation of the electricity transmission and distribution systems, for the approval of the regulator. These codes will set out the technical aspects relating to connection to and operation of the transmission and distribution systems, for use by licence or authorisation holders. Section 33 provides that the ESB shall offer to enter into agreement with any licence or authorisation holder or eligible customer.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that the ESB shall prepare a statement setting out the basis for the level of system charges for connection to and use of the transmission or distribution systems. That statement will be available to licence and authorisation holders so that they may estimate and plan for the charges to which they would be liable. Section 35 provides for the approval by the regulator of the statement of charges.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides that the regulator may grant permission for the construction of direct lines for the transmission or distribution of electricity from licence or authorisation holders to eligible customers, where access is refused on the basis of a lack of capacity in the existing transmission or distribution system. Section 37 provides that the ESB will prepare a statement for the approval of the regulator setting out estimates of future generation and transmission requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides that the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, may make an order directing the regulator to impose public service obligations on the board or other licence or <Col N="1172" /> authorisation holders, in the general economic interest. These obligations may relate to security of supply, regulatory, quality and price of supplies, environmental protection and use of indigenous energy sources. The cost of these obligations would be recovered from all electricity users.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides that the Minister may by order provide for the recovery from consumers of electricity of specified costs or revenue relating to generating stations constructed before 19 February 1997, which the ESB may be unable to recover as a result of the implementation of the EU directive. We will dwell on that issue later.</P>
    <P>I do not expect to make orders under either of those sections until the electricity directive is fully implemented. The enabling powers set out in those sections will ensure that anyone who is issued a licence by the regulator will be aware that a public service obligation regime and a transitional levy will be part of the implementation of the electricity directive as a whole.</P>
    <P>I will use the public service obligation provision to ensure the continued use of peat fired power stations subject to certain conditions and the promotion of renewable and alternative energy. It is also my intention that there will be a transitional regime, probably for a period of five years, which will ensure that certain ESB stations, which are effectively State investment, do not become &ldquo;stranded&rdquo; or unable to operate because of the introduction of competition. The detailed work to provide the basis and foundation for these measures will be done over the coming year.</P>
    <P>Sections 40 to 45 contain repeals and amendments of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, and an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to include the Commission for Electricity Regulation. The principal repeals are those of sections 36 and 37 of the 1927 Act. This power will now be vested in the regulator.</P>
    <P>Section 46 provides that the power to make a special order to compulsorily acquire land for the purposes of constructing or reconstructing a power station shall be transferred from the ESB to the regulator. Sections 47 to 50 provide that certain powers relating to the laying and use of electric lines, currently resting with the ESB, may, with the consent of the regulator, be exercised by holders of plant authorisations.</P>
    <P>Sections 51 to 53 provide that certain regulations already made by the ESB shall also apply to other electricity undertakings and eligible customers.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule sets out in detail the functions, powers and duties of the Commission for Electricity Regulation, and sets out the basic terms and conditions of employment for members of the commission. It provides that the costs of running it shall be recovered by a levy. It also states that the regulator will be accountable to the Minister, a joint committee of the Oireachtas, and the Comptroller and Auditor General, as appropriate, regarding its costs and the various functions which it carries out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> As stated earlier, the larger directive must be implemented in Ireland by February 2000. The Department has engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process with the industry. The first part of that was the consultation paper issued by the previous Government in May 1997. There was a discussion forum in January 1998. There then followed an intensive series of bilateral discussions with industry interests, and the consultation paper issued in May 1998 on which some 60 sets of comments were received. In tandem, on numerous occasions I met the ESB board, the combined trade unions of the ESB, IBEC and consumer groups, and all the potential applicants for authorisations who sought to meet me.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised me that while full implementation of the directive is due by February 2000, it is essential that a key part of it, relating to the establishment of an independent regulatory body, be brought into force now. The function of the regulatory body will be to take over the licensing of generation and supply so as to eliminate the potential for conflict of interest. This is particularly important in view of the stated interest. Each one who came to see me said that they were going to enter the market. Obviously, each group must first seek authorisation and then planning permission and must go through all the proper steps. New generating capacity is likely to be needed by late 2001.</P>
    <P>I stress both the independence and the accountability of the regulator. It is important for the development of open competition that there be confidence in the whole regulatory process. I have been careful to ensure that the Bill clearly provides that the regulator shall be independent in the performance of its functions but that it will be required to report in a democratic fashion.</P>
    <P>Like the Deputies opposite and many others, I share an unease that, in ceding powers in line with European requirements by setting up of regulatory bodies, we do not go so far as to dismantle the democratic accountability which is clearly necessary. The idea that any country, large or small, could have a posse of regulators faithfully going about their duties but accountable to nobody is an absurd notion. As I stated, at the first opportunity I will introduce a Bill to amend the telecommunications industry regulator Act because, although that regulator has been before the committee on two occasions, in the beginning there was confusion in that she thought there was a vacuum about it in the Act. There is no point in us thinking so little of ourselves that we give up all our powers and then decide that the person to whom we have given them is not obliged to report to anybody. It would not be right in a democracy to give a body such as a regulator quite considerable powers and not make it accountable so there are clear provisions for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise will retain the policy role regarding the electricity sector. This role will include the power to decide the level of market opening &ndash; I decided it will be 28 per cent which is the minimum in line with the <Col N="1174" /> directive &ndash; and to make orders relating to public service obligations, dealing with security of supply, regularity, quality and price, protection of the environment and use of indigenous resources. As I have already indicated, I do not envisage any such orders taking effect until after February 2000, when it is intended that all the required legislation will be in place to implement the EU directive. It is important that, first, we are proceeding with the provision of the regulator early and quickly before we get into the competitive regime. I am confident that this approach strikes the right balance between independence and accountability. This Bill will allow the Oireachtas to scrutinise closely the performance of the regulator, yet will allow it to be independent as it carries out its functions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Bill will be to give the power of granting licences to generate and supply, and the power to authorise the construction of plant to the new regulatory body. At present, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, as amended, governs the electricity market. The ESB has regulatory powers under this legislation, including the power to licence other operators to generate, distribute and supply electricity. To date, the IVO plant in the midlands is the only substantial independent plant to be undertaken, with construction yet to start.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is necessary to introduce this primary legislation to give effect to a new industry structure and regulatory regime. Legislation to implement the balance of the directive will be introduced as soon as possible after the regulatory commission has been established. That legislation will also change the status of the ESB to a public limited company under the Companies Acts. It is our intention to have all structures in place to facilitate market opening in 2000. That will be the millennium project for the ESB.</P>
    <P>I hope that the spirit of adventure which guided the first brave courageous men of vision who set out on the path to bring electricity to this country, will guide the men and women of the ESB and of all other potential entrants to the market as they set out on the wide open road of competition.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I will of course be back as soon as I have met Secretary of State Mowlam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fundamental and historic Bill because these are the most profound changes which have occurred in over 70 years of electricity generation in Ireland. I am unimpressed by the Minister's and the Department's execution of the obligation to implement this directive. We have had two years since February 1997 to get our act together in relation to the key questions. I have met all the potential IPPs, all the people who are interested in obtaining licences to set up electricity generating capacity in Ireland, and there is total uncertainty and confusion as to what will be the realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of her speech the Minister stated that &ldquo;Legislation to implement the balance of the directive will be introduced as soon as possible&rdquo;<Col N="1175" /> and that new legislation for the ESB will be forthcoming. Therefore, this is only one of three legislative instalments and the key questions remain unanswered. This is not an academic or esoteric question because in 1996 a decision was made by the then Government that the green energy sector would be able to sell electricity to anybody but, because ESB never introduced a system of wheeling charges for access to the transmission and distribution system, that has never been implemented. It is unable to sell electricity and the ESB remains a monopoly.</P>
    <P>It is not clear whether there will be one or ten power stations. As there is a timelag of two years in planning and construction, the target of February 2000 will not be met. The Minister has had two years to prepare the legislation required. I have fundamental questions about the public service obligation levy, the stranded capacity equations and the wheeling charges to which I cannot get straight answers. This legislation does not provide them. Because of the time span involved all the issues should have been dealt with by now.</P>
    <P>The Department has been ultra slow and cautious. The Minister who is fully reliant on her civil servants does not appear to appreciate the details involved. This is one of the most complex areas I have had to deal with. We do not know the historic baggage for which the ESB will require compensation and for how long. The Minister should indicate the period involved in relation to the public service obligation and stranded capacity levies and the trading terms applicable to allow the companies involved make detailed submissions to their bankers and finance boards. They will not be in a position to do so until these questions are resolved.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the ESB that competition will be introduced for customers whose electricity consumption is in excess of 4 gigawatt hours per annum. Of its 1.48 million customers, 320 will benefit from February 2000. It will then have to compete for the large customer &ndash; Aughinish Alumina, Intel and CRH. In the case of telecommunications, competition was introduced initially in respect of overseas calls only. There was tariff rebalancing in respect of domestic calls. Will the same apply in this case whereby householders will be required to pay an extra £17 million? The chief executive of the ESB, Mr. O'Hara, indicated recently that the revenues collected from domestic accounts are 10 per cent to 12 per cent below the actual cost reflective price. What this means is that those who are part of the franchise market will be required to pay a subsidy to allow the ESB compete for the large multinational. The ESB should be told to absorb the cost out of its £160 million profits in return for a concession of a five year transition period. I am advised by the ESB that, ostrich like, the Minister has her head in the sand and does not appear to understand or care about the issue. I do not want the bulk of ordinary consumers to be given a kick in the teeth. <Col N="1176" /> They will be required to pay more from February 2000.</P>
    <P>On renewal energy, sections 8 and 27 set out the terms on which green energy producers will operate and sell electricity. We are legally obliged under the agreement reached at the Kyoto summit to stabilise CO2 emissions at 15 per cent above their 1990 level by 2010. The annual growth rate is well in excess of 6 per cent while energy growth has not been decoupled from GDP growth. Power stations account for 38 per cent of emissions. The age old Irish attitude is to seek a derogation and to trot along as if nothing has happened. We will table specific amendments to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>Green energy producers &ndash; I am talking principally about wind energy &ndash; have not secured the terms they require. It is not stated specifically that it shall be a function of the commission to promote green energy. This should be rectified by the insertion of an additional clause. As wind energy producers are in a position to meet 40 per cent of requirements only, there should be an obligation on brown goods suppliers of electricity to meet the balance.</P>
    <P>A narrow definition of &ldquo;final customer&rdquo; has been inserted in the Bill. A figure of 4 gigawatt hours is mentioned. Banks, building societies, franchise operators, health boards and hospitals should be allowed to combine. This, in turn, would enable green energy producers to approach the Eastern or South-Eastern Health Board as a single buyer which would be of benefit to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I have received disturbing reports about capacity and supply and demand. The ESB informed the relevant Oireachtas committee that power cuts would not be necessary until the winter of 2001. The Minister might confirm my understanding that over recent months there have been 14 amber alerts where the surge in demand for power was so great that power cuts were not too far away. If that is happening in the winter of 1998-99, the ESB may have underestimated the real growth in demand and there may be a critical urgency to commission new plant. How many amber alerts have there been and will the Department, independently of the ESB, assess the situation? The rule of thumb is that capacity should exceed peak demand by 30 per cent and I believe that ratio is in danger. There has been a reliance on the Northern Ireland connector to avoid power cuts this winter, although we have had very mild weather. We need 200 or 300 megawatts of new plant almost immediately and certainly before the year 2001. Everything should be done to accelerate the ESB's programme to increase their capacity, even if this means that at some future date some of that capacity must be put up for tender to the highest bidder in order to meet the competition objectives. I do not wish to see the Government or the regulator holding back the ESB in order to allow competition to develop if, in the meantime, we <Col N="1177" /> face the real threat of power cuts. There are other ways of overcoming that problem.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not in the House to hear some specific questions which I wish to put. We have some experience in dealing with Ms Etain Doyle, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, who will appear before the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport tomorrow. There is not a robust system of accountability by the regulator. Either the resources of the committee are limited or the nature of the relationship is such that the system is inadequate. In the initial stages, Ms Doyle refused to accept that she had an obligation to appear before the committee. There is no system such as exists for Parliamentary Questions. It is clearly defined that the regulator must be independent of the Minister and, essentially, the regulator is accountable to no one. However, in this case there is provision for a series of directives. Because of the nature of the directives, we need clarification as to whether Mr. Reeves will be the puppet of the Minister or will actually be independent. This matter can be examined on Committee Stage but these directives and the circumstance of them need to be determined.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the appeals panel rather than the regulator will have all the power. Will the panel include someone from the Competition Authority or will there be some qualifying criterion for members of the appeals panel? Will they be friends of the Minister, councillors from the Minister's party or political cronies or hacks?</P>

      <P>I hear the Taoiseach is doing everything he can to persuade the Minister to become the next EU Commissioner, so she may not be dealing with this matter directly. We must have a clear system of accountability for the regulator. I understand the appeals panel will be appointed on a per case basis. Why can there not be a permanent appeals panel for a period of two years? An individual panel per case seems to be unusual. The qualifications for membership of the panel must be established and a role for the Competition Authority must be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost and competitiveness review agreement deals with a number of critical areas. I read the paper delivered by Paddy Reilly, secretary of the ESB group of unions, to one of the fora held by the Government in which he outlined the series of areas set out in the CCR: the ESB must remain in public ownership; the ESB must be allowed to compete freely; the nature of stranded and existing plant; the power purchase agreements; the transmission system operator and its relationship with the ESB. Can the Minister clarify, because this is a tripartite agreement, whether Article 24 of the EU directive allows for the full retention and implementation of the CCR? It strikes me that there may be a huge conflict in <Col N="1178" /> this area. It may be that the EU directive supersedes the CCR. We have already seen the Minister supersede the CCR with regard to price increase so I do not know how attached she is to it. In fairness to the ESB group of unions and others, we must have legal clarity with regard to the CCR in the implementation of this directive. If there is to be a breach of the CCR because of legal reasons we must have this matter clarified.</P>
    <P>I could not find any consumer role for the commissioner or the commission in the Bill. People come to my clinic telling me that they have applied to the ESB to have a newly built house connected to the electricity supply and have received a bill for £3,500. When they point out to the ESB that they are only one pole away from the supply and that this seems expensive they get no satisfaction. There is no system of external, independent evaluation because the ESB has a monopoly and will continue to have a monopoly in the supply, distribution and connection of electricity.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the ESB and to their staff for their dedicated ethos of public service over the past 70 years. This was demonstrated during the recent storms.  They have done a very good job but in relation to customer complaints there is nowhere a dissatisfied customer can go. Recently the issue of white or brown goods bought from the ESB and added to the purchaser's electricity bill has been highlighted. The first bills paid in a household budget are the rent and the ESB bill. Is this an abuse of a dominant position? I am not impressed by the ESB spending £4 million per year on slick public relations to develop its corporate image when it has a monopoly of supply and direct distribution. Whether people think the ESB is good or not, they do not have the choice of getting their electricity supply from anywhere else. I would like to see that money put into a proper consumer complaints and customer care service which would be accountable to the commissioner.</P>
    <P>I have met a number of people to discuss the question of potential operators as independent power procurers. All of them, including Meridian, Marathon, Canadian Utilities and so on, have indicated that if they are to apply for authorisation and licensing to build a plant it will be a gas-fired station. I understand that there is not enough gas to provide the needs of all the potential licence applicants. Irrespective of the electricity regulation licensing and authorisation procedure, access to gas will be a critical issue with regard to location and price. Only one 300 MW user can have the licence because no more gas than that is available, given existing commitments, the finite nature of the Kinsale field, the timelag in developing the western finds and the lack of a second pipeline. It is wrong to regulate electricity and not regulate gas in tandem. I understand Mr. Reeves is to be an overall energy regulator, including gas, but where is the legislation? </P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has indicated that it is pur<Col N="1179" /> suing a joint venture to enter the electricity generating business. There is a real potential conflict of interest here. Can Bord Gáis Éireann, which has a monopoly of the supply and distribution of gas and effectively owns the gas fields, give itself preferential treatment with regard to the supply of gas for a gas-fired station and thereby preclude others? This is a critical issue and must draw one to the conclusion that whatever else the Minister does, she must arrange to construct, through the private or public sector, a second gas pipeline immediately. It is already somewhat late but if we are to implement a proper electricity liberalisation policy that issue must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This legislation could be compared to the telecommunications directive on liberalisation which Deputy Stagg had a direct role in bringing to this House. Telecom Éireann did not get anywhere with any case it put forward about stranded capacity and its historic costs. The growth in telecommunications is such that the analogy is not complete, but it seems the ESB will be able to have a strong pivotal position. In all such implementations the monopolist, whether in transport, telecommunications or the energy sector, retains at least 70 per cent of the market share thereafter. I have no fears about the ESB and I want it to be treated fairly, but critical questions must be asked. There is an inherent conflict that the author of this Bill is a shareholder in the ESB. We must be seen to be fair on this issue. It seems the ESB cannot be refused authorisation to build a station. Will it be prevented from selling below cost offers of electricity to large users to minimise market entry by competitors? Will there be a ban on below cost selling, and if so, how will it be operated and implemented? The experience and role of the Competition Authority must be included on the commission. Officials of the Competition Authority should have a direct role in the recruitment of staff and competition expertise should be provided on the Commission and on the appeals panel.</P>
    <P>Someone put forward a scenario that the ESB could have a splurge of extra capacity and seek compensation under the Bill for its stranded assets. This would mean the consumer would be asked to compensate the ESB for its decisions. Essentially, this would be double counting and the consumer should not be exposed to such a threat. In all these areas the position is unclear. We will have to return to these questions during lengthy deliberations on Committee Stage. All the data I read, including the initial May 1997 consultation paper and the subsequent May 1998 consultation paper, referred to third party access versus the single buyer system. The original data referred to the single buyer system. Is it the case that we will pursue the single buyer system or only third party access? I note the officials indicate we will pursue third party access and that is what I assumed.</P>
    <P>I have raised questions and made criticisms. I would like a clear objective set that there would <Col N="1180" /> be a five year transition period during which the ESB would deal with whatever problems it has, and that we would build two or three new stations, and I include the IVO Europeat in that. We should try to get that minimum level of competition as a pragmatic necessity. We do not want a splurge of extra capacity. We need a second gas pipeline and these stations to be put in place to ensure that over time there will be a real prospect of competition and that after five years there will be a commercial market whereby there will be a wholesale pool. The ESB could and would compete, but others would be able to sell their electricity. People have asked me if they sign up commercial customers to sell 60 or 80 per cent of their electricity what price would they get from the ESB to sell it back into the pool of the remaining electricity. The viability of such operations depends on this price. A reasonable price must be fixed. It would be cheaper than the ESB could supply it. That question needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Great Island Power Station is in my constituency. The peat sector has been stitched up to ensure that, irrespective of the economics and CO2 emissions, we will continue to burn peat. I accept that political decision, but a more economic fuel in Tarbert and Great Island, an oil based station, is oil because those stations will pay the price for oil because it is more competitive than turf. What will be the power purchase agreements per plant and can the Minister give an assurance that the lifetime of these power stations will be protected? </P>
    <P>I want a clear pro-customer bias in our objectives. Clear-cut objectives are not set out in the Bill. The Minster's speech also failed to set ultimate goals. Despite all the teething problems, everyone would agree that the aviation and telecommunications sectors and their consumers have undoubtedly benefited from competition. Electricity is more complex, more capital intensive and the effect of competition in Northern Ireland has been to push up prices in the short-term. We need orderly development to ensure that for a period of five years domestic consumers will not have to pay more for electricity and that the price for domestic and commercial consumers will be under the EU average and, ultimately, that they will be able to benefit from competition in an orderly way. I want to avoid a splurge of excess capacity, but I also want answers to questions about wheeling charges, PSO and stranded capacity levies to be dealt with now.</P>
    <P>Before we conclude Report Stage I would like the ESB company legislation brought forward. I favour vertical separation of the ESB companies after a period of five years because I do not believe in Chinese walls although a moat might be necessary for the transitional period. I would like that legislation and all elements of the legislative effect of the directive brought forward. We can bring Dermot Reeves before the Oireachtas Committee to ascertain where we are going. If these very reputable companies which can provide competition cannot get straight answers to <Col N="1181" /> these questions, we cannot have<i> de facto</i> competition. We can put all the legislation in place and put forward all the theories, but we will not have competition. That is what we must have at a minimum level and we must not have a splurge of competition at the other end. My party will not oppose Second Stage, but I deplore the<i> ad hoc</i> nature of it and the slow pace at which this Bill has progressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to talk about the importance of the electricity industry, we would be bound to understate the case. Electricity could be described as the life blood and engine of industry and commerce and the balm of domestic comfort. That paraphrases a speech on this issue written for me by a civil servant when I was in the Department. I cannot remember its detail and I did not bring it with me when I left the Department, but it was a gem that described the effect of electricity.</P>
      <P>I remember life in rural Mayo before the arrival of electricity and the changes its arrival made to people's lives. I remember the day electricity was connected to our house. The electricians who were wiring the house asked if we wanted a plug as well as a light. My father said, &ldquo;No, we do not need a plug. What would we need a plug for&rdquo;, but my mother said, &ldquo;Put it in. You never know.&rdquo;  There have been major changes since then. Many changes in the domestic area have benefited women in particular and have taken the drudgery out of housework. Our industry and commerce has blossomed from the arrival and development of the electricity industry.</P>
      <P>We should be mindful that the workers in that industry had very tough jobs, particularly those who worked on rural electrification. They had to work very hard for very low rates in extreme conditions and gradually they built up their rights through their unions. The retention of these rights is very important.</P>
      <P>They became highly skilled, efficient and effective. The last stage of their effectiveness was the arrival of the CCR agreement. They made very real sacrifices in that agreement. It was the first step in preparation for competition, because there is more to be done within the ESB structures to make them properly prepared for competition.</P>
      <P>To answer the question posed by my colleague, there is no conflict between CCR and the EU directive on electricity, but there is great conflict between CCR and the Minister's proposals, which go far beyond the directive and take an interpretation of it that it is in conflict with CCR. That conflict will raise its head as a result of the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is a very delicate and temperamental bird. The Minister should avoid unnecessary ruffling of its feathers at all costs. The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity was regarded, until recently, as a natural monopoly. With the arrival of new technology and capital, particularly international capital, gener<Col N="1182" /> ation is now seen as an area in which competition can be introduced. Transmission and distribution are still seen, by and large, as a natural monopoly &ndash; we do not want to have ten sets of wires for ten sets of producers. However, there is provision within the Bill for new generators to build their own lines.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to implement the EU directive on electricity and to change the law to allow for competition, in the first instance, up to the level of 28 per cent of the top of the market, growing to an automatic 32 per cent by 2003. The Bill also legislates for the regulation of competition. Those are the clearcut, visible purposes of the Bill and the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>However, there is also a hidden agenda, to which the Minister did not refer in her speech. I believe she is preparing through this Bill, and the Bill which is to follow, for the privatisation of the ESB. I would love the Minister to tell us, quite clearly, that is not the case. She has not declared any policy for the commercial State sector and has given no indication of what her Government intends to do with the resources which will arise from the sale of State companies. She seems to operate a policy of picking them off, one by one, when there is a convenient buyer or when she has convinced the workers in an industry that it is in their interests for it to be sold off. That will transfer power from the Minister to boardrooms in New York, Japan and Berlin and the Minister will have no control over what is an essential interest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister had many options arising from the directive. The first imperative was to open the top 28 per cent to competition by 2000. How should this be achieved? It should be done in such a way that the security of the energy supply is not put at risk, the ownership of the industry remains, as far as possible, in Irish control, and a diversity of fuels is employed, such as gas, oil, coal, peat, hydro and wind. A heavy reliance on imported gas is obviously undesirable, even if it is cheaper in the short-term, from a security of supply point of view.</P>
    <P>It should be done in such a way that maximum security is given to existing jobs and by avoiding making redundant existing electricity power stations. It should be done in such a way to maintain effective Irish Government control over the industry, which is vital to our economic well being, rather than vesting that power in foreign based multinationals, which will have only one interest in Ireland &ndash; to extract the maximum profit from Ireland and its people &ndash; and will serve their own interests rather than Ireland's. In the case of shortage or international disruption, I doubt if Ireland's interests would be primary with such people as we are now bringing to our country.</P>
    <P>It should be done in such a way that there is clear democratic accountability by those responsible for policy and the regulation of the industry. Workers in the industry, and in the new companies to be introduced, should enjoy the hard won <Col N="1183" /> rights of existing employees, including the right to join a union of their choice and to have that union recognised. It should be done in such a way that domestic customers in rural and remote areas are guaranteed a supply of electricity at an affordable price. This should be clearly stated as a PSO. The cherry pickers will otherwise exclude them from a supply.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister proposing? Given the wide range of choices available to her, it is nothing short of extraordinary that she has gone for the option that it likely to do most damage to the integrity of the industry, the workers in the industry and the final customers, both domestic and commercial.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to open the generating market to all and sundry spells disaster for the ESB, its workers and, particularly, for domestic customers. Already, the vultures are lining up. At the last count, there were no fewer than eight separate conglomerates with definite proposals to build their own power stations. All proposals are for combined cycle gas turbines &ndash; a dangerous single fuel scenario. Of course, the vultures did not drop out of the sky. They were invited to come to Ireland by the Minister and her proposals.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the likely effect of this policy and the consequent flood of proposals for new generating plants. Let us say each of the eight developers build a 200 megawatt power station or that four each build a 400 megawatt power station, which is more likely. That will result in a new capacity of 1,600 megawatts in total, and there are more to come &ndash; we are only at the beginning of the game. That represents 40 per cent of the total required capacity of 4,000 megawatts, and 55 per cent of the peak demand of 3,000 megawatts. All of these will be modern combined cycle gas turbine generators and will be able to seriously out price electricity generated from turf, oil and coal and from older stations. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>These providers will, in the short-term, be confined to the top 28 per cent of the market. The Minister must explain what will be done with the excess capacity of these new entrants to the market. She cannot say the regulator will deal with that issue &ndash; it is a matter for political decision.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not accept there will be inevitable and irresistible pressure to open the market further and earlier to allow other commercial users access to this new cheap energy? Does she not see this must lead to large scale closures of existing ESB plants &ndash; that the oil burning stations at Tarbert in Kerry and Great Island in Wexford will be forced to close and that the turf burning stations at Ferbane, Rhode, Lanesboro, Shannonbridge and Cahirciveen, despite a temporary reprieve, will be forced to close? In the &ldquo;in speak&rdquo; that we now have on this issue, they will be redundant or stalled capacity.</P>
    <P>There is no possibility that these stations will be able to compete in an open market, in the way <Col N="1184" /> in which the Minister is proposing to open it. That we have PSOs on a temporary basis to protect them will be just that &ndash; temporary. The Minister will be gone &ndash; she will have worked herself out of a job because she will have sold everything she has responsibility for if she lasts her full term &ndash; and so will the power stations about which we are talking. Does the Minister not realise that the social and economic consequences of her policy on communities where these soon to be redundant power stations operate will be massive unemployment and social disruption? Does she realise that the major coal-burning station at Moneypoint, which represents nearly one third of the total capacity, will not be able to compete with new purpose-built stations, and faces cutbacks and closure? It will certainly solve the environmental problem that Deputy Yates talked about. Does the Minister accept that, arising from investment restrictions imposed by this and previous Administrations, the ESB was prevented from replacing its old stations with modern efficient ones and as a result it will be priced out of the market?</P>
    <P>I was privileged to have taken part in the negotiations at the EU Council of Ministers which produced the directive on electricity. The main concern of Ministers was how to avoid redundant or stalled capacity in the existing power companies when competition was introduced in electricity generation. It was unanimously agreed that to avoid redundant capacity &ndash; i.e. the closure of existing power plants &ndash; a long and gradual lead-in time to competition was required. The previous Government wisely decided to implement the directive by running competitions for the additional capacity that would arise. I am glad the former Minister, Deputy Dukes, has joined us. He was instrumental in that matter.</P>
    <P>While all who qualified could compete, including the ESB, the floodgates would not be opened and the dam not be breached, but new players and competition would be introduced. Existing generating stations, workers and their communities would be protected and would be afforded time and an opportunity to meet the competition. The same experts who advised the Government in 1994 and 1996 and who arrived at this sane and planned scheme for the introduction of competition also advised the present Minister. However, the Minister has rejected that advice and has thrown out the previous Government's proposals. In what can only be described as a right wing ideological decision, the Minister has rejected the spirit and careful balance of the electricity directive and has imposed her own political &ldquo;private is good, public is bad&rdquo; credo on the people and the energy industry.</P>
    <P>She could not wait or bide her time before offering the Irish electricity industry to the international predators she has now invited into our country. These powerful and ruthless organisations have been applying pressure on the Minister, not for the 28 per cent but for all they can extract a profit from. That is all they are <Col N="1185" /> interested in. I can only conclude that the international predators had a ready listener in the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. Indeed, she told us she met them all.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have catastrophic and dangerous consequences if it is not amended in a fundamental way. It is bad for Ireland Incorporated and for the customers and could well spell the death-knell of the ESB and Bord na Móna. Maybe that is the object of the exercise and the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>To the unions in the ESB and Bord na Móna I would say that there are serious dangers in the Bill for their members. I will seek by argument and persuasion, as far as I can, to change the Bill. However, the Minister commands a majority in the House at present and I do not have the muscle to force the necessary changes. The organised unions will have to decide what action is appropriate for them to take to protect their members.</P>
    <P>Private sector provision of utility services is not new. This is our second time around the block on the issue. In the 19th century and early 20th century, private sector provision was the norm. Services were nationalised and developed to a point where there was a close to universal service because the private sector was unwilling and unable to provide it. In modern times, New York city is at a stage of development beyond where we are now. It privatised its electricity service some decades ago and has a multiplicity of providers. However, these privateers have failed to give a satisfactory service to the people of New York who experience daily or weekly power cuts. The burghers of that city &ndash; and they are certainly not socialists &ndash; have now decided to get rid of the privateers and establish one municipal company to replace them. Surely, there are lessons to be learned by all of us in that.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the area of regulation. When the European Union decided to legally require member states to introduce competition where none existed, it was also decided that to ensure fair play for all competitors an independent regulator should be put in place to oversee the market and competition therein. The regulator's independence refers to independence from the owners or participants in the competition. The position up to now in Ireland was that the Minister was the owner and the regulator. The EU electricity directive and directives in other areas mean that the Minister cannot be both the owner and regulator, and must choose between one or the other.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to retain the power to regulate then she would be obliged to divest herself of the ownership of the company &ndash; the ESB, in this case. It is assumed that would automatically mean the company would be privatised. That, of course, is one option and one that, I suspect, the Minister, her Government colleagues and probably my colleague in Fine Gael, would favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just going on what the Deputy said, although I am not putting words into his mouth. There are many other options, for example, worker shareholding or ownership; transfer of company's shares to another ministry, which is the French model &ndash; they seemingly can implement the directive in that way; transfer of share ownership to a specialist management agency &ndash; the National Treasury Management Agency in Ireland &ndash; to manage the shares for the Government.</P>
      <P>If any of these models were adopted the Minister could retain the powers of regulation. However, the Minister has decided to adopt the previously used Telecom Éireann model whereby the regulator will be appointed as an independent agent and the Minister will, for the time being at least, retain ownership of the ESB.</P>
      <P>If her experience with Telecom Éireann is anything to go by, the Minister will sell off the ESB at the earliest possible date. If she gets her way, by the time her term is up she will go down in history as the last Minister for Public Enterprise, as she will have sold off all public enterprise in Ireland to the multinationals. Despite her determination &ndash;&ldquo;sell and be damned&rdquo; seems to be her attitude &ndash; she has failed to state what her policy for the public enterprise area is, or what the Government wishes to do with the proceeds of her sales. It seems clear that her policy is to pick them off one by one while assuring those remaining that they are safe for the time being.</P>
      <P>To turn to the matter of regulation as dealt with in the Bill, I would refer the House to a paper presented to the Law Society in UCD by the Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, SC, on 12 November 1998, entitled &ldquo;Who regulates the regulators?&rdquo;  In this paper, the Attorney General argues that those who are given a mandate by the people have no right to transfer that mandate to another body or person. If a transfer of mandate or power occurs, the person or body to whom that power is transferred must be accountable to those who granted the original mandate, i.e. the people.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Attorney General hates non-legal persons like myself paraphrasing what he has to say, but I think that is the gist of the case he made &ndash; I hope I have interpreted it correctly. I certainly welcome what I see as a clear definition of the role of this House and the need to hasten slowly in transferring our role to those outside the democratically accountable arena. I regret that this clear advice was not available when we first tested the water on regulation.</P>
      <P>It fell to me by default to bring the first regulatory legislation through this House. I tried to ensure accountability and to reduce democratic deficit in that Act, but the Act fell in that regard at the very first fence when the director of telecommunications regulation refused to attend the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. I would welcome the inclusion of an amendment by the Minister to bring the telecom regulator in line with the thinking outlined by the Attorney General in his paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> The Attorney General laid it on the line. It is the task of the House to lay down in legislation a clear and unambiguous policy which the regulator is to implement and by which his or her decisions are to be guided. The concluding section of the Attorney General's paper states:</P>
    <P>So we return to the question which was posed at the outset: who regulates the regulators? It is clear there are a number of ways in which regulators can be required to render account for their activities and decisions. These methods have a varying level of efficacy and do not always meet the exacting standards of the principles of democracy and political accountability. The courts provide a valuable means of ensuring procedural regularity and can address decisions which are outside the statutory remit of regulators. However, they cannot and should not be required to turn their minds to issues of political accountability. As I stated earlier, their role does not necessarily satisfy the public's demand for accountability.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the greatest responsibility in this area falls to the Legislature. The process of appointing bodies to undertake responsibility for defined sectors or issues of public concern must, as it were, come full circle. Delegation of authority must be done in a detailed and precise manner. The exact remit of any regulator must be clear and obvious to all those who will be affected by their activities. A coherent policy framework, formulated by the Executive and the Legislature within which the regulator is required to make decisions, must be set out. Most importantly, a comprehensive statutory system must be devised through which the regulators are required to render account to the Legislature and ultimately to the people.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms chosen in each individual case should be agreed at the outset and disclosed to the public. Anything less represents an erosion of the principles of democracy and political accountability and weakens the democratically elected branches of Government, the Legislature and the Executive. Legislators, Ministers, Deputies and Senators should not stand over any system which takes away the right of citizens to hold to account individuals who make decisions that affect their everyday life.</P>
    <P>Regarding regulation by independent bodies, the House has transferred large chunks of its authority to outside bodies that are not accountable to the people. There are many examples, including the National Roads Authority and An Bord Pleanála. A practical example arose in the case of the super dump in Kill. The county manager, who is not elected, made the original decision to refuse permission. An Bord Pleanála, which is not elected, reversed that decision and granted permission. The courts, which are not elected, adjudicated on the decision by An Bord Pleanála. <Col N="1188" /> The European Court, which is not elected, will make the final decision.</P>
    <P>Local, national and international bodies have been involved. However, at no stage in the proceedings were any public representatives involved in making decisions at local, national and European levels. The public could not and would not believe that the people they elected and to whom they gave a mandate were powerless in all stages of the saga. Legislation is introduced in the House on an almost daily basis to transfer power from this Chamber to outside bodies which we cannot subsequently question.</P>
    <P>We should take the Attorney General's advice to heart and consider the detail of the Bill as it affects regulation to ensure that it complies with the principles he laid down. It falls well short of the standards he gave. It is unique that we as Members of the House, who are elected to represent the public and given great powers and authority, would give that power away without a fight. I have not read in history about groups of people who had power and authority who gave it to others without putting up a fight. We appear to be doing so blindfolded with our hands tied behind our backs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions with regard to alternative energy, but I am mindful of earlier attempts to promote and advance alternative energy and to provide the right to those so minded to purchase green energy supplies directly. These efforts were frustrated only by the ESB. The Bill needs to be amended to ensure that position will not continue or be repeated. I will put the case in detail on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have long lasting and far reaching effects on every man, woman and child in the country. If it is passed without amendment, it will have dire consequences for the ESB and its workers. It will undermine a long standing policy on diversity of fuel for security of supply and will hand over to foreign interests essential control of our vital energy production. I ask the Minister and her departmental experts to take on board the unnecessary dangers for Ireland on the road she has chosen and to look to the alternatives I have outlined which were well researched by the previous Administration. Considerable time will be required between now and Committee Stage to adequately consider these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has recognised the importance of the process of liberalisation. She has correctly identified that this is not an instant condition and the process will continue for a period. The Bill is the first in a series of measures in that regard. The Minister correctly recognises where we should head and what we should seek to achieve in the future. Many changes must be made and many Bills will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill, which was first published in December 1998, the Minister seeks to establish a director of electricity regulation to oversee generation and competition in the market. She will <Col N="1189" /> retain control over policy and responsibility for the electricity sector. It is important to recognise that. The Bill was published after a detailed consultation process which involved the unions, management, the Department and others. Tribute must be paid to the unions and management for engaging in that process and for their special and significant input into what some may consider cataclysmic changes given that the ESB has had a monopoly. In fairness to the company, despite that position, it has functioned exceedingly well. It has been conscious of the importance of providing a stable and sound service, ensuring that reasonably priced electricity is available and ensuring stability of supply.</P>
    <P>In the course of the consultative process, I understand that more than 60 separate submissions were made to the Department of Public Enterprise following the production of the consultation document. This is a significant number of submissions which made a particularly important input to the evaluations and examination in terms of the production of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The directive came into force in 1997 and it requires that 28 per cent of the electricity market be open to competition by February 2000, increasing to 32 per cent by 2003. This will not be the only Bill in this process. It is important to pay tribute to the staff of the ESB. The company is almost as old as the State. It has been in existence for 70 years and it employs 9,000 people. The ESB has assets totalling more than £2 billion and its turnover is in the region of £1,200 million. In 1997, it had a £160 million surplus. Taking into account that it has 1.5 million customers, the ESB has been central to the development of the State and economy. That must be acknowledged as must the contribution of ESB staff who have given a most commendable service over the years, particular in times of difficulty when natural disasters occurred. Over the Christmas period, many ESB employees left the warmth of their homes and families to provide service in atrocious weather conditions. Members of this House thank them for that.</P>
    <P>The ESB must consider what is likely to be demanded of it in the future and what will be essential to ensure continued and increased economic growth. While a stable regime has pertained in this area in the past, the ESB must now face up to new competition and consider customer demands for a decrease in prices. It must also be conscious that the ability to guarantee supply will be more important than ever in the future. The independent regulator must be seen to be independent and must be accountable to a number of other bodies.</P>
    <P>The ESB must recognise the necessity for change. Its current capacity is in the region of 4,500 megawatts. That will increase by 2001 when the new peat fired station comes on stream. The available margin for the purposes of carrying out essential maintenance and improvement works will be relatively narrow &ndash; the ESB estimates it is in the region of 950 megawatts. We are walking <Col N="1190" /> a pretty tight rope. Given the necessity to meet ever increasing demand, we must plan ahead. That is what the process in which we are currently engaged seeks to do.</P>
    <P>A number of matters must be considered in the context of that preparation. We must realise that between now and 2010, in the region of 2,000 additional megawatts will be required and ensure we are in a position to meet that demand and facilitate people who could meet it to do so in a manner which would acknowledge the importance of environmental protection. Wind farms, of which there are a number in north County Roscommon, are one of the obvious and most beneficial future electricity sources. The general response to them from the public is positive, recognising the existence of an alternative energy source which would do nil damage to the environment. The environment is under threat worldwide due to the persistence of certain practices in other countries and, to some degree, in this country. Wind farms represent an opportunity to make a real contribution. Environmental protection is a central consideration in the development of alternative energy sources in order that we continue to enjoy a good quality of life. The quality of food production, the tourism industry, people's health and of our daily lives all rely on that.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides us with an opportunity to develop clean energy production methods in a number of locations. Although we must consider what might constitute an acceptable proliferation of wind farms, ultimately we must recognise that the common good will be served by their development. I understand in regard to alternative production methods, there are a number of suitable sites off the west coast; they should be given urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties I frequently hear raised in regard to the development of alternative energy sources relates to so-called 'wheeling charges'. Providers wish to know in advance what the cost of selling into the ESB network will be and what production costs will be involved. Initially, it is envisaged that alternative energy producers will cater to the top 28 per cent of the market, representing in the region of 300 or 350 consumers. If one looked in the <i>Golden Pages</i>, one could probably identify those 300 or 350 consumers quite easily. This legislation seeks to allow suppliers to supply renewable energy through the ESB and they must be given some idea of what the costs will be in order that they can be competitive and offer the desired results to their customers. It has been suggested in some quarters that by February 2000, there may be as many as 500 suppliers of alternative energy. A technical description indicates that if suppliers provide four million units of electricity or more per annum, they become eligible to purchase supply from anyone.</P>
    <P>In the past, the ESB attempted to enter into certain arrangements with particular consumers and was found to be in breach of the law by Europe. Some people have entered into contracts <Col N="1191" /> with the ESB and may well wish to continue with those arrangements. I can see what the ESB was attempting to do although some might describe it as sharp practice. Nevertheless, we must ensure that alternative energy providers will be given a fair opportunity to get into the marketplace. The market will be such that a new provider will build a source of energy production with the intention of supplying customers across the ESB distribution and transmission network. They are not aware of what costs will be involved and that is what has given risen to the so-called 'wheeling charges'.</P>
    <P>I understand the regulator has been appointed and I wish him well. One of his first tasks must be to request the ESB to provide information on wheeling charges. The ESB has the opportunity to slow down the process of liberalisation by stipulating too high a wheeling charge or by playing games with the Government or others. There needs to be discussion sooner rather than later if we are to get a smoothly running competitive system in place as soon as possible. I have made inquiries from a number of interested sources whose view is that these charges and the criteria for them must take account of such factors as the cost of developing the system, annual operation and maintenance charges, future connection costs, future system reinforcements and improvements, losses in the system &ndash; as much as 6 per cent of energy production disappears in the form of heat &ndash; constraints in and on the system, frequency of control and fault levels. Some of these areas are easily quantifiable. If persons participating in the production of low-cost energy are to be competitively placed in the marketplace, it is essential that we take account of the necessity to be fair and equitable to these people and that they know in advance what they want to achieve.</P>
    <P>On the appointment of a regulator, we must be fully conscious of the necessity for accountability, responsibility and openness. Deputy Stagg, who was involved in producing similar legislation in another area, pointed to the necessity for answerability to the commission, the Minister and the Committee of Public Accounts. That must be a feature of this legislation. I am glad the Minister referred to the desirability of that and the needs that will be met if it is put in place. The commission will commence with one member and increase to three as time goes by. It is essential that it be answerable to this House and to the Minister. The independence of the regulator is also essential. He must be seen to be acting in a fair and transparent manner that will leave no doubt or suspicion about his function.</P>
    <P>The Bill has taken cognisance of the electricity directive. It will begin the process of overseeing the introduction of competition in the electricity sector. Up to now, the function of licensing, generating and supplying electricity belonged to the ESB. Since new operators will now be required to seek such licences from the commission, the independence and transparency of the com<Col N="1192" /> mission is vital. Persons who were granted a permit after 1 September 1998 by the ESB to generate and supply electricity should apply to the commission within three months of the enactment of this Bill. That is an important change that affords an opportunity for persons who are already contracted.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Electricity Regulation will be funded by the industry. The legislation will provide for the monitoring and provision of information about access through the transmission and distribution systems. It is necessary also to set down clearly the criteria for the charges. The commission will issue the authorisations for the construction of generating stations and will report to the Minister. The Minister may direct the commission to impose public service obligations on the board or other licence or authorisation holders in the general economic interest. These obligations may relate to the following: environmental protection, security of supply and use of indigenous fuels.</P>
    <P>This is the initial part of a process of legislation that will go on for some time. I want to see fairness of opportunity, a downward spiralling of prices, stability and guarantee of supply. At the same time I acknowledge and appreciate the service of the ESB to this nation's affairs and the fact that it rightly acknowledges that it has an important public responsibility to the taxpayer which is acknowledged constantly in its investment in the infrastructure, plant and machinery that it manages, controls and owns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see an Electricity Regulation Bill coming before the House because, although it may seem on the surface to be a contradiction in terms, regulation in this context means liberalisation. I am delighted that we are participating in a process of liberalisation which, we should remind ourselves, has been largely driven by the European Union and by a concern to liberalise markets and give people who are active in markets an opportunity to get the benefits of competition. This has been pushed by the European Union. The process has shown its worth. It has proved its value in air transport and in telecommunications. I have no doubt that it will prove its value in other sectors which so far we have not touched. We have gone a good deal less down this road than many of our fellow members of the European Union. One of the curious things is that we have gone less far than a number of the states applying to join the European Union. Hungary, for example, has achieved far more in liberalisation than we have. We have nothing to pat ourselves on the back about, nothing of which to be particularly proud. We have been rather tardy in taking the necessary steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill and other legislation that will come before us, we are merely bringing what are or were previously State monopolies into the area where they have to compete in markets. It is important that we should bell that cat and state <Col N="1193" /> clearly what we intend to do. I have never seen a State monopoly engaged in a market sector that did not have the effect of restricting competition, restricting the quality and level of service available to customers and increasing prices above the levels at which that service or product could be provided. That is not a criticism of the intentions of people working in State monopolies. It is in the nature of State monopolies that they do that. State monopolies in this regard are no more and no less to be suspected of such conduct than private monopolies. In many ways they act in very much the same character.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been preceded by a very substantial consultation procedure which has proved its worth. Undoubtedly more consultation will be needed as we go through this process. I see more consultations are already programmed on some of the issues which remain unresolved in the Bill. I look forward to the continuance of that process of consultation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on circulating an information note with her speech on Second Stage. This is a useful development. The information note, together with the explanatory memorandum, help us focus on some of the important issues which arise. The information note is frank, stating clearly that &ldquo;the draft Bill contains the minimum necessary provisions as advised by the Attorney General to achieve the essential legislative change&rdquo;. Why does the Bill contain only the minimum legislative provisions? I know the process of regulation, as it is termed in the Bill, and of liberalisation is fairly involved and complex and there is a view that we should carry it out one piece at a time. However, in case it is overlooked, I wish to make the point that there is another view, namely, that we should do the whole job at the same time, what I call the big bang approach. There is a very strong argument for doing it this way, something which was put to me strongly in a more complex context in 1990 by the then Minister for Finance in Poland who is a good friend of mine. We talked about the difficulties of making a transition to a market economy. He was in favour of the big bang approach as he said he had to deal with a currency which was not a currency as it was not convertible at the time, a market which was not a market as there was no free formation of prices at the time and demand which was not demand as Poland had a command economy. He said all that had to be changed quickly and not piece by piece. When asked why he firmly believed this, he gave a simple example, saying one cannot start with buses if a decision is taken to drive on the right hand side rather than the left hand side of the road. It seems this Bill is in danger of starting with the buses and that other essential parts of the system are not being put in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates has raised questions about a number of areas which are either not dealt with in the Bill or not dealt with clearly and I do not intend to go over that same ground. However, there are some other points I wish to raise. One <Col N="1194" /> of the consultations which took place was on the basis of a consultation paper published in May 1997 entitled Proposals for the Electricity Supply Industry Ireland, which Deputy Stagg and I remember very well as we authorised its publication. At the beginning of it we set out the features of the EU directive with which we would have to deal. These included separation of accounts for the different parts of the business; the institution of an independent transmission system operator; the specification as eligible customers of those who are to have choice; access to the system for producers, supply undertakings and eligible customers either inside or outside the territory; the construction of new generating capacity and the recognition of public service obligations. At least two of these essential features are not dealt with in the Bill, the separation of accounts for the different parts of the business and the institution of an independent transmission system operator. Unless the Minister has a compelling argument, the process we establish here and the commission to regulate the industry will have its hands tied behind its back if we do not have separation of accounts for different parts of the business and an independent transmission system operator. In replying, I would like the Minister to tell me exactly what is in mind in relation to these two important features of the task to be undertaken. I may have misunderstood the Bill and, if so, the Minister can correct me. I am not clear as to whether it provides access to the system for supply undertakings, producers and eligible customers outside the territory. If they are not covered in the Bill, why not, as it seems there should be no conceptual difficulty in making such provision?</P>
    <P>A number of colleagues have commented on the fact that the commission is being funded by the industry it serves. This is a laudable principle which should be followed in all other areas where we undertake this type of regulation, otherwise known as liberalisation.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of the Bill which give me cause for worry, not so much in relation to generating, transmitting and supplying electricity, as in the way generation of electricity will be regulated. Section 17 in Part III deals with licences and authorisations and states that the Minister will specify the criteria by which authorisations to generate supply are to be determined. Quite properly those criteria relate to the safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the environment, public service obligations, energy efficiency and other matters. That is fine, but I would like to know why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in this connection as it seems these are matters to which the Minister must have regard when setting criteria.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions in sections 18 and 19 and my understanding of how these will work. These sections give the commission the power to decide who gets a licence or authorisation, what conditions will attach to it, what monitoring will apply, etc. As it is not clear from <Col N="1195" /> the Bill, I would like to know if I am correct in my understanding that the powers of the new commission supplant or substitute the powers that would normally be given to our planning authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and other bodies which normally regulate planning matters. If this procedure operates separately, independently of and without regard for the planning procedure we normally apply to all other undertakings, there is a case which has not been made. It would be highly undesirable to have installations for the generation of electricity, which of their nature are bound to be intrusive though necessary, being planned, authorised and operated under monitoring procedures without regard to our planning authorities. I would like some clarity on this matter as I would be worried if this was segregated and dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>The commission will also have the powers to modify licences or planned authorisations. The explanatory memorandum states that &ldquo;where such modifications are not agreed, but still considered necessary by the commission, the modifications may be imposed, subject to minimum notice and certain conditions&rdquo;. In that context, one can understand that there has to be a point of decision somewhere in the process.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the commission may decide to hold a public hearing before reaching its decision. Again, that word &ldquo;may&rdquo; worries me. It seems, almost by definition, that when this commission modifies a licence or plant authorisation it is a matter of legitimate and possibly serious concern to the public in the area around the plant and perhaps to others who may be affected down the line. It is not good enough in that context to say the commission may hold a public hearing before reaching its decision. Unless the matter is very trivial, in which case there is hardly likely to be a disagreement, there should be a public hearing so that all the interests legitimately concerned may have access to the process.</P>
    <P>There is a set of provisions for an appeals mechanism in Part IV. If I understand it correctly, this mechanism comes into play where the commission either refuses a licence or an authorisation or refuses particular requests for modifications, or intends to impose modifications to licences or authorisation and there is a disagreement about it. Appeal panels may be established to hear and determine appeals regarding applications and shall have the powers, rights and privileges vested in the High Court or a High Court judge.</P>
    <P>These appeal panels will be powerful bodies and will have substantial powers of decision over important matters. It may be a lack of application or understanding on my part but I do not see any role for the public or place for a consideration of the public interest. I see a consideration of the needs and requirements of electricity generation, transmission and supply. I also see room for the operators of generating plants, transmission sys<Col N="1196" /> tems and supply systems to have their interests taken into account. I do not see, however, a particular obligation to have regard to the public interest, the environment and how all these things will affect people around them. Unless I seriously misunderstand it, there is a planning, appeal and decision mechanism which leaves the public and concerns which are proper to the public completely to one side. If that is the case, this is not a desirable way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 to 25 give power to the commission, among other things, to protect public health, safety and the environment. If the commission is to do that, it will need advice about these matters and the best place to get advice about public health, safety and the environment is to consult the public, people who represent it or those who are mandated by the public to speak on its behalf. With the best will in the world, the operators of generation, transmission and supply systems or those who are charged with regulating how they do so are not necessarily the best people to do that.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with access to transmission and distribution systems. Has the Minister had any second thoughts about it? Is there a new part to deal with the separation of accounts? Will the Minister explain why the separation of accounts is not provided for in the Bill because I cannot find where that requirement is made?</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for the preparation of a statement by the ESB setting out the basis for the level of system charges for connection to and the use of the transmission or the distribution system. That statement must be available to licence holders. Section 35 provides for the approval by the commission of such a statement. What are the ground rules? The ESB &ndash; it is the ESB which is specifically envisaged here &ndash; will prepare a statement of charges which it will submit to the commission. The commission, which looks at them, may do one of three things. It may accept the scale of charges, reject them or vary them in some way. All the Bill tells us is that the commission shall approve them. Is the commission completely sovereign in this regard? If the commission does not agree with the scale of charges proposed by the ESB, will the ESB have to accept the scale of charges sent back to it by the commission? It is important to know that because we need to know the function of the commission in respect of the general public interest.</P>
    <P>The commission will also have powers to grant permission for the construction of direct lines for transmission or distribution systems. It will have the powers previously vested in the ESB to acquire land for the purpose of constructing or reconstructing a power station. I would like to make the following point clearly and I do not want anybody to misunderstand it. In the exercise of those powers, the question of attitude to and consideration of the public is very important. The ESB, no more than any other monopoly, has not been famed down through the years for its readiness to consider the feelings of people over whose <Col N="1197" /> lands transmission lines would go or beside whose land generation stations would be built. It seems to be a feature of State monopolies that although they act on behalf of the State, they are not very citizen friendly in these matters. I would like to be assured that the commission will have a rather more open and compassionate approach to these matters than that which we have sometimes seen in the past from the ESB and other State monopolies. I want to make it clear that I am not making a specific criticism of any person or persons in the ESB, but institutions of that sort quickly lose touch with the reality of the people with whom they deal.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the questions which arise in relation to this Bill. I would like to see in section 38 a more specific and explicit reference in the context of public service obligations to considerations of consumer interests and, a phrase which fell out of the documentation on the way to this Bill, consideration of the regularity, quality and price of supplies in addition to the security of supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister for Public Enterprise on the introduction of this Bill which follows a detailed consultation process during which I understand 60 submissions were made to the Department. It must be introduced so we may comply with the EU directive on the generation and supply of electricity. This directive clearly states that 28 per cent of the market must be open to competition by February 2000. This will increase to 32 per cent by 2003. There will be independent regulation to oversee the electricity industry and, in particular, the standards and performance of the ESB's monopoly business. It will establish a transparent authorisation regime permitting open market entry. I understand all persons granted a permit by the ESB to generate, distribute and supply electricity must now apply to the commission within three months of the enactment of the Bill and that all new operators must seek licences directly from the commission. The balance of the provisions of the directive will be dealt with in further legislation to enable the above deadlines to be met.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide a regulatory framework for the introduction of competition in this field in Ireland. All competitors will have open access to the ESB's network. It will involve the operation of the ESBs national grid transmission system separate and independent of the ESB by an independent system operator. I expect the ESB will be provided with fair and adequate compensation for the use of its lines and network it has built up over the past 70 years. We will have a wholesale trading mechanism which should be sufficient to promote entry to serve eligible customers in direct competition with existing ESB generation or to serve new growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Market arrangements should be consistent with the vesting transition arrangements and should underpin these. Where the market arrangements <Col N="1198" /> oblige an individual player to supply electricity to third parties, it should also allow that player to adequately recover his costs. Where market arrangements oblige an individual operator to purchase electricity for third parties, it should not result in increased costs to that operator. Market arrangements should promote industry efficiency and security of supply and should not discriminate between persons or classes of persons. Operators coming into this market should not engage in a cherry-picking exercise where they supply only certain elements of the market and not the ordinary customers living in rural areas. They may not want the hassle of servicing those type of customers.</P>
    <P>We must have revenue security for existing generation investments as part of the transition regime. We must provide price security and stability for customers, delivering assured prices and avoiding damaging price instability during the establishment phase of the competitive market.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister will retain overall policy responsibility for the electricity industry. The Commission for Electricity Regulation will award licences to the ESB and others to generate and supply electricity. It will, in effect, perform the function that has been handled superbly by ESB management and staff for more than seven decades. The commission will have full control over the provision of electricity services in the State. It will be totally independent and will hire its own staff. It faces a daunting task in measuring up to the precedent set by the ESB in the control and supply of electricity over the past 70 years.</P>
    <P>In complying with the EU directive, it is vitally important that we do not lose sight of the high standards we have taken for granted over many years. We must ensure that those who seek licences are capable of delivering a first class service at the same price level. The commission will have the power to authorise the construction of generating stations and will be responsible for the provision of information about access to the transmission and distribution system and the related changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill will bring about many changes. It signals an end to an era. The Electricity Supply Board has enjoyed a monopoly in the field of electricity for over 70 years but it has not abused its position during that time. It has been operated efficiently and successfully over 70 years and has grown into one of the largest commercial entities in the State. It enjoys a world-wide reputation for high standards which has resulted in its being employed as the recognised consultant in many countries setting up new generating stations and networks.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of visiting Malaysia some years ago and I was delighted to learn from business people and others there that the ESB was well respected for the important work it carried out in electrifying Malaysia and for its work on other important projects in the country. That work has been replicated in other countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The words I would use to describe my experience of the ESB service, as a homeowner and a businessman, are efficiency, reliability and reasonable cost. We are all aware that the ESB staff did not remain on holiday during the emergencies that arose this Christmas and the previous one. They worked extremely hard for their customers in responding to these emergencies. Will the competitors coming into the country offer the same service or will they cherry-pick their customers? </P>
    <P>The ESB has set a standard which is second to none in Europe. Its price structure is below the European level and I am advised it is approximately 20 per cent lower for domestic customers and 4 per cent cheaper for industry. The ESB deserves all the praise it has been given by myself and others. It is important that we bear in mind the necessity of continuing this excellence of service under the proposed new regulations which will allow open competition in the electricity generation market. We must not sacrifice service and low pricing structures as we enter the new millennium. We must ensure that anything which complements or partly replaces the existing service runs to the current high standards so rightly demanded.</P>
    <P>We have seen change abroad when national bodies were privatised. Privatisation of the electricity industry in the UK has brought about price structures that are approximately 12 per cent higher for the domestic consumer. There have been increased water and rail costs in the UK following privatisation. We have read about water shortages in a country where there is an abundance of water but there is no inter-connecting network between the independent water boards. This is an aspect of a multiplicity of suppliers that concerns me. We read of an increasingly inefficient rail service in the UK which is experiencing many problems with the maintenance of its infrastructure and the associated travelling delays. None of the services are noted for their reliability or efficiency.</P>
    <P>When we lease out the national grid from the ESB &ndash; the chairman will be interested in this &ndash; we must seriously consider upgrading our rail structure, as we have done with the roads structure. I am sure that question will be debated in the near future.</P>
    <P>The inefficiency to which I referred in the UK dates from the time those companies were taken out of state ownership. There have been many critics of the standards of maintenance since this occurred. I am not suggesting all State bodies should remain in State ownership but that they should be examined on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the proposal that concerns me is that we have had a single body delivering an excellent service. It was accountable to the State and to its customers. Under the new set-up, however, the control structure or accountability will not be as clearcut. Many people will compete with each other to deliver a service to the busi<Col N="1200" /> ness and domestic sectors. We must ensure that this competition operates on a level playing pitch and that the new companies do not gain a preferred position in the existing electricity generation body, the ESB. We must set levels that will ensure all competitors deliver a standard of service that has become commonplace and accepted by the public for many years. They will demand the continuation of those high standards set by the ESB. Those standards must be maintained.</P>
    <P>There are strict standards of safety in the current electricity system. Those standards must be matched by our competitors. It is imperative that we do not go beyond the terms of the EU directive and that we bear in mind the sterling service given to us by our native industry during its many years in operation. The ESB is a State asset of great value and enormous potential. It was developed by the State and its operations have been paid for by the people. It is their company and it has grown with the new State. It is synonymous with our progress and the many advances in society. It has been fundamental to the effective function of the country's economic and social development. It is part and parcel of the history of Ireland and in supporting the Bill I ask that the points I have made be taken into account by the Minister. I am confident she will do so. I should have said at the outset that I wished to share time with Deputy Collins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to speak briefly about the merits of deregulating various energy and telecommunications sectors. The regulations certainly worked in the telecommunications sector in terms of price reductions. However, the Government and our European counterparts must not consider the option of deregulating the postal system. I will deal with the Bill first and analyse these issues later.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of an independent commission for electricity regulation which will license and regulate the generation and supply of electricity and authorise the construction of a new generating plant. The commission will oversee the introduction of competition into the electricity sector in accordance with the EU electricity directive. This states that competition in the electricity sector must be introduced by February 2000. Some 28 per cent of the sector must be open to competition by this date and will be increased to 32 per cent by 2003. Further legislation will be introduced next year which will fully implement the balance of the provisions of the directive before the deadline of February 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission for Electricity Regulation will also issue authorisations for the construction of generating stations in addition to overseeing the provision of information about access to transmission and distribution systems and related charges. The Bill provides that the commission will be funded by the industry it serves and will <Col N="1201" /> be accountable to the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Comptroller and Auditor General and to an Oireachtas Joint Committee. The commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will be able to hire its own staff, subject to the normal conditions which apply to State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is clear the new commission has teeth. It controls the licensing arrangements for electricity undertakings, which should result in competition and price reductions in the cost of electricity in due course. Section 14 provides that any person granted a permit after 1 September 1998 by the ESB to generate, distribute and supply electricity under section 37 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, shall apply to the commission within three months of the enactment of the Bill. Any existing permits granted by the ESB after 1 September 1998 will expire 12 months after the enactment of the Bill. Any applications for such permits which are still with the ESB shall be deemed to be an application to the commission. This is a sensible provision which deals with the transition period as the new commission becomes legally operative.</P>
    <P>Another example of how the commission is being given power lies in section 15, which provides for the granting of plant authorisations by the commission. This means the issuing of authorisations for the construction of generating stations. The Minister for Public Enterprise will specify the criteria by which authorisations to generate and supply are to be determined. These criteria may relate to the safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the environment, public service obligations, energy efficiency and other matters. The commission will be entitled to modify licences or plant authorisations it has granted. Where such modifications are not agreed but are still considered necessary by the commission, the modifications may be imposed subject to minimum notice and certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The issue of where a particular generating station is to be located can, at times, be contentious and can be a possible source of local discontent due to the size of such structures. Sections 20 and 21 deal with such circumstances. These provisions set out the way in which the commission may hold public hearings where it considers representations or objections to proposed modifications to licences or authorisations raise matters of sufficient public interest. These sections also define the terms under which reports of such hearings will be prepared and how the concerned companies or individuals will be informed of the outcome of the hearing.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 and 27 define those customers who will be eligible to choose their supplier of electricity from February 2000 next. They are defined by the level of their electricity usage. This level is set to introduce competition up to 28 per cent of the market initially, and this figure will be increased to 32 per cent by 2003. In line with the Government decision of April 1996, all electricity customers will be entitled to purchase electricity <Col N="1202" /> which is produced using a renewable or alternative form of energy as its primary source.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the legislation establishes an appeals panel to deal with cases where applications for licences or authorisations are refused by the commission or where modifications to them are not agreed. The appeals panel may be established to hear and determine appeals regarding applications and modifications to licences or authorisations and shall have the power, rights and privilege vested in the High Court or a High Court judge.</P>
    <P>Part V relates to how access to transmission and distribution systems will be given to individual licence or authorisation holders. At present, the ESB has the monopoly in electricity supply. For private operators to gain access to such a supply would require ensuring that ESB facilities in terms of distribution and transmission would be made open to them. Sections 32 and 33 deal with such circumstances. These sections provide that the ESB shall prepare a grid and distribution code for the operation of the electricity transmission and distribution systems to the approval of the commission. These codes will set out the technical aspects related to connection to an operation of the transmission and distribution systems for use by licence or authorisation holders. The ESB shall offer to enter the agreement with any licence or authorisation holder or eligible customer regarding connection to and use of the transmission and distribution systems. The commission may give directions to the ESB as to the matters to be covered in the context of such agreements. The ESB shall also prepare a statement setting out the basis for the level of system charges for connection to and use of the transmission and distribution systems. The commission may also grant permission for the construction of direct lines for the transmission and distribution of electricity from licence or authorisation holders to eligible customers where access is refused on the basis of a lack of capacity in the existing transmission or distribution system.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the public service obligations of the new commission. The Minister will be entitled to make an order directing the commission to impose public service obligations on licence or authorisation holders in the general economic interest. These matters may relate, among other things, to matters such as environmental protection, security of supply and use of indigenous fuels. The cost of those obligations would be recovered by electricity users. Environmental concerns must be taken on board by the commission at all times. European Union legislation in recent years requires that large-scale projects, before being given the appropriate go-ahead, must have an environmental impact assessment carried out to ensure compliance with all EU environmental legislation.</P>

      <P>I met the Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, briefly at an official function. It was on the occasion of the unveiling of a portrait of herself and her husband Nick.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I attach high priority to maintaining close ongoing contact with the social partners, on both a formal and informal basis. My most recent formal engagements took place in the context of the inaugural meetings of NESC and NESF on 4 and 12 November respectively, on which I have already reported to the House. In addition, I chair one of the quarterly Partnership 2000 plenary meetings each year. The most recent was last July's plenary and my next such engagement will probably be in July this year.</P>
      <P>The 26 January plenary meeting focused principally on the themes of competitiveness and agriculture, forestry and food, including rural exclusion. Also on the agenda were presentations on budget 1999 and the draft report of the expert group on child care.</P>
      <P>Throughout this year, the focus will be on the twin aims of completing the implementation of Partnership 2000 and paving the way to a successor agreement. In that latter regard, the NESC has been asked to prepare a new strategy report which would form the basis for a successor, while the NESF has been asked to take on a new role in developing policies and programmes to tackle long-term unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. It will also have an important contribution to make in evaluating the effectiveness of policies within the context of both the social partnership agreements and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>Another key priority throughout 1999 will be the promotion of partnership at workplace level. This work will be led by the National Centre for Partnership, in which both IBEC and ICTU are active participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree the issue of literacy should be a central concern of any new partnership agreement? Is he aware a recent OECD study shows that 17 per cent of those between the ages of 16 and 25, who were recently educated, have literacy problems? Is he aware many employers cannot fill vacancies with people who would be willing to fill them, because those concerned, even for relatively unskilled <Col N="1206" /> jobs, who must be able to read instructions, are unable to do so. Literacy is probably the root cause of at least half of the current long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Literacy is a very important matter. I am not sure it has ever been addressed at the quarterly meetings. It has been ignored for a long time. I am pleased this Government has particularly focused on it. There was a lack of resources for education programmes and training. In 1998 the literacy budget was doubled and again in 1999. All the surveys of the long-term unemployed have shown that illiteracy is a major problem, not so much for younger people but older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also a problem for younger people. The surprising aspect of the OECD finding is the extent of illiteracy among younger people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly a problem in the long-term unemployment category and I remember being involved in a number of reports when Minister for Labour. It was shown up then as a major problem. Given that the literacy budget doubled last year and this year, it is giving a strong focus to doing something about the problem. People are happy to attend adult education programmes. The Adult Education Centre, Mountjoy Square, which has students from the greater Dublin area, is actively involved and extending its classes. I do not know whether the matter has been on the agenda for any of the plenary meetings but I will mention it because it is important. Many employers are finding it extremely difficult to get people even in unskilled posts and in the lower clerical posts which require some but not enormous skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that many of the unskilled jobs currently available will not be available five years from now to people who do not have adequate literacy skills because of the nature of the technological change in the workplace? The jobs of many of those at work are at risk because their literacy skills are not up to standard. There is a need to invest in literacy as a job preservation measure. Will the Taoiseach further agree that this issue needs to be addressed in social partnership? For example we need to re-organise our teaching resources to ensure there is a point in the curriculum beyond which children cannot pass unless they have learnt to read and write adequately, perhaps the first year in secondary school. As the ASTI is proposing, there should be an evaluation year when people would catch up in certain basic skills in which they may have slipped behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree if that is to be done, it can only be done in the context of a comprehensive pay negotiation because it has pay and conditions implications for teachers, for instance? Will he agree that literacy is an issue which <Col N="1207" /> should be made a central part of the pay negotiations, not that he should just mention it, which I am glad he is willing to do, but that he should try to drive this issue as one of the central planks in ensuring that we do not have 200,000 people unemployed despite the fact that most advertised vacancies cannot be filled? There is a reason for that and it is literacy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not consider literacy the main reason. There are many reasons. Deputy Bruton and I were at the same seminar recently where we listened to the views of employers who have vacancies. However, literacy is very important and the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, has been highlighting that, and seeking resources to provide for adequate training. Deputy Dermot Ahern informs me that in the NAPS, literacy is the subject of a special programme and special discussions to try to do more to assist the long-term unemployed. What Deputy Bruton is seeking is happening. It is not central to the pay discussions but if we could get it as part of the social partners' drive, no doubt it would help. Many of the voluntary community groups make literacy an issue.</P>
      <P>In terms of the broader subject, as Deputy Bruton says people in employment falling behind is an issue. I am continually urging employers to continue training and retraining to up date skills and re-skill their staff. That is an important aspect.</P>
      <P>However, literacy is a major problem for those who will clearly not have a chance, even when jobs are available. That is why we have provided substantial resources in that area. I am glad the NAPS are also doing this. I know it is included in the Action Programme for the Unemployed on which the Tánaiste has been working with other Ministers. Literacy is clearly an issue and we should do everything we can. Deputy Bruton is asking me to have it included in some form or other in the debate on social partnership and I will certainly look at that.</P>

      <P>At the meeting of 26 January, was it formally decided or is it now the Taoiseach's view that all of the outstanding items and relative pay claims associated with the PCW have now been completed?

      <P>In terms of the progress on the discussions, the meetings have started with the public services committee of ICTU, as Deputy Quinn will be aware. They have set in motion the exploratory process about which I spoke to the Deputy before Christmas. People are approaching the discussions not with a detailed blueprint of how they can get pay on performance but to see if they can come to an agreement as to how this issue can be dealt with in the future. There is no proposal yet designed but there is broad agreement that it is well worth exploring to see if they can find a way which would both take into account the desires of workers for fair increases and at the same time take account of the Government's wish not to breach pay guidelines.</P>

      <P>At the July plenary meeting or earlier last year the Taoiseach talked about the necessity for a new system for pay determination in the public sector &ndash; it was in the context of social partnership generally. Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply on the desirability of performance related pay agreements in the public sector that it is the intention of the Government, as one of the participants in Partnership 2000 and in the preparation for the next programme, that the next programme, if one is to be agreed prior to ratification by the various parts, will contain proposals and arrangements for performance related pay in the public sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Government's desire if we can achieve it in agreement with the social partners. There has been much discussion about this in recent years. Those in favour of it are prepared to negotiate a broad blueprint to see if it is operable. People not in favour will always ask &ldquo;How can you have performance pay in the public sector?&rdquo; and I have listened to that for 20 years. It has not been tried and we are going to make an effort to see if we can have performance pay which can satisfy the employees and at the same time not breach public service pay guidelines.</P>

      <P>Have there been discussions with the social partners on the regionalisation of the country as part of the partnership agreement? I heard that it was proposed to have consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked about literacy and the Taoiseach responded by saying that there were other issues, not just literacy, which could explain long-term unemployment. What other headings <Col N="1209" /> would he add to literacy? For instance, would homelessness, other gaps in education and low pay be included in his list? Will he indicate in his preparation for the new partnership if indicators, other than GNP and GDP, which would show trends in many of those problem areas, could be included so that we will see a more rounded picture of the success of the partnership?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On regionalisation, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. There are questions tabled on that so perhaps we could leave that to the discussion about Agenda 2000. However, there has been discussion and dialogue with the social partners.</P>
      <P>There are many areas outlined in the unemployment action programme and in the various NAPS schemes. They relate to people losing benefits when they take up jobs, the distance from the work place and educational disadvantage of one form or another. There are, however, many other difficulties where employers are finding that many people are opting for part-time employment. Listening to some of the major employers the other day, it was interesting to hear that the only way they can fill full-time pensionable jobs is to make agreements that people will work two or three days per week. Even when they can offer contracts for five-day weeks and 52 weeks per year, people do not want them. That is the case for many of the big organisations and it is a change from how it used to be.</P>
      <P>Of the two seminars this weekend, the CERT one involved 7,000 vacancies in 1999 and at Opportunities 1999 there were 21,500 vacancies on offer in January 1999. Clearly there are difficulties in the labour market and that even applies to Civil Service posts. When the Civil Service recruited for staff a decade ago almost 50,000 people took the examinations and now fewer than 10,000 take them. Of the successful applicants, we are lucky to get one in two who are still interested six months later. The circumstances are entirely different from what they were a decade ago.</P>

        <b>:</b> With the experience of the last ten years, does the Taoiseach agree that partnership is one way traffic with most concessions being made by workers to employers? What does it say about partnership that Mr. Eric Fleming, a trade union official, was not renominated by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to the Health and Safety Authority? Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a strong suspicion among construction workers that the reason he was not renominated was that he was so outspoken about the high death rate on construction sites and the cavalier attitude of some employers to health and safety? There is a suspicion that pressure was brought to bear by so-called partners not to renominate him. Is it a good example of partnership that many construction workers continue to be pressurised by certain subcontractors to work in the black economy and thereby forfeit not just their obligation to pay tax but <Col N="1210" /> their rights and entitlements? On wage levels and the tight control of workers' pay rises, what signal is sent by the fact that workers cannot afford to put a roof over their head and there are no constraints on so-called partners, developers and landowners? How will this impact on future arrangements in regard to partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold a different view. I remember the time, prior to social partnership, when the unemployment rate was 18 per cent, when there were over 50 in the classroom, when the high tax rate was 65 per cent and when there were few, if any, opportunities. It was a case of them and us and there was confrontation practically every day outside the gates of Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries General group on EU policy, which I chair, meets approximately every four to six weeks. As part of its general supervisory role in relation to EU policy, the group is responsible for co-ordinating the Irish approach to key European issues, including Agenda 2000. We are in a period of intense negotiations on the next round of Structural, Cohesion and agricultural funds. In recognition of this, the Government has established a Cabinet subcommittee, which I chair, on Agenda 2000 specifically to co-ordinate the Government position on the main elements of negotiations on the next round of EU funding as they develop. This committee is serviced by an expert technical group, which I also chair, and comprises senior officials from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance. This group has met twice and prepared a number of papers for the Cabinet subcommittee. The smaller more frequent meetings of the subcommittee, and its technical group, will allow for much greater engagement by the key Ministers in the detailed strategy of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The German Presidency has underlined its determination to reach agreement on the Agenda 2000 package by the end of March. To achieve this aim, there will be an informal Heads of State and Government meeting on 26 February. After this meeting the Presidency intends to bring all strands of the negotiations together in advance of the special summit meeting in Berlin on 24 and 25 March.</P>
      <P>In addition to the groups mentioned, the Department of the Taoiseach participates in policy formulation and follow-up on key issues arising in the EU agenda, such as Structural and Cohesion Fund negotiations, agriculture funds, enlargement, EMU, institutional reform, employment, justice, freedom and security and external relations of the EU through a variety of interdepartmental groups and fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU policy formulation is the product of liaison <Col N="1212" /> between my Department and the other key Government Departments, notably, Foreign Affairs; Finance; Agriculture and Food; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department also liaises with the offices of other EU Heads of State and Government and their embassies in Dublin. Through this network of contacts the Department advises me on the views of our European partners and contributes to the development of EU policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the status of negotiations at EU level on the issue of transferring heavier responsibility for financing the Common Agricultural Policy to member states and the proposal to reduce price supports for beef and milk? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The German Presidency has presented additional proposals which disimprove what is on offer in the European Commission paper of 18 March 1998. The French have presented counter proposals which are not acceptable to us. We are opposed to co-financing, although a growing number of member states are in favour. On the 1984 milk quota system, under the latest proposals we would receive an additional 1 per cent. This is highly unsatisfactory given that other member states would receive another 7 per cent or 8 per cent. The proposals presented by Commissioner Fischler would largely assist mountain farmers in other member states, not us. We are working closely with the French on some matters and with the Spanish on others. There is, however, substantial disagreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a percentage but if the German proposals were accepted, it would be enormous. Direct payments account for 54 per cent or 55 per cent of farm incomes. All headings would be hit. Currently we receive in excess of £1 billion each year in transfers. Last year we received £1.065 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that figures released by the Revenue Commissioners in the last two days, under the Freedom of Information Act, indicate that the counties of Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary have incomes below the national average and therefore, on the basis of income assessed by the Revenue Commissioners as <Col N="1213" /> being earned in those counties, have a case to be included in Objective One?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is not simply one of income. When we looked at the ground rules for regionalisation we found that the counties in a region must be contiguous. When the submission was being prepared last year we concluded that the best way to achieve regionalisation, based on the realignment for Ireland of our present NUTS II arrangement, was to divide it into two regions, one to comprise of the Border counties, the midlands and the west, including counties Cork and Kerry and regional transition for the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has mentioned contiguity. Is the Taoiseach aware that the counties I mentioned are contiguous? Counties Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford are at least as contiguous to each other as Clare is to Kerry across the Shannon estuary. They have been shown by the Revenue Commission to have incomes below the national average. Is the Taoiseach aware that these Revenue Commission statistics will cause grave concern among people in Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary who are being deliberately excluded from the possibility of qualifying for Objective One status even though statistics indicate that they have below average incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the European Commission and EUROSTAT do not examine Revenue figures in making these decisions. They are concerned with GDP, as Deputy Bruton knows. In trying to fulfil the criteria we worked on GDP. That is how the counties were included. Counties Clare and Kerry were included because they are on the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that after 25 years of membership there has been a marked shift in attitude among our partners in the European Union and within the Commission itself towards Ireland's general position? If he does accept that, does he think the bargaining position with regard to regionalisation put forward by the Government  &ndash; and he admitted earlier today that this new proposal will itself not require any primary legislation &ndash; will further alienate a Commission which is increasingly alienated by the Irish position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Ireland has done relatively well and improved over the years. What is at issue is that in the final transition period we, like other countries, get a fair and equitable share of what remains. I do not understand those who argue &ndash; and I do not include Deputy Quinn among them &ndash; that we should negotiate on the basis that we do not wish to see any of the Objective One regions maintained and that we move to a position of receiving approximately 40 per cent of the funds we receive at present. I do not under<Col N="1214" /> stand that argument and I think it is hopeless tactics. I wish people would desist from making it because it is entirely unhelpful to the Government in the negotiations. Parts of the Border region and the west are still a long way behind anything resembling the average European income. We are trying to ensure that as we go through this transition period, when we will lose a substantial amount of resources, that we try to hold on to some of those resources and that for the areas which are still disadvantaged we try to retain Objective One status as other countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Spain are doing. That is what we are trying to achieve. I do not believe because we have done well overall that we should concede that argument. We would be very foolish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's claim that we will lose substantial resources is a complete misrepresentation of the facts. That is precisely the kind of attitude that is aggravating our partners in Europe. To suggest that we are not being helpful is to invite the riposte that if the Government wanted Opposition support in relation to maximising our position in Europe he should have spoken to us last June or even July when the proposal for regionalisation was first mooted. He could have engaged in meaningful dialogue with the rest of the country, which he has refused to do. He postponed a consideration for submission until after a certain date in October and the time available now &ndash; hoping to get a reply from EUROSTAT late in February, a couple of weeks before the meeting to which he referred &ndash; gives us no time at all. Would the Taoiseach not agree that to suggest we will suffer a reduction in resources is a mispresentation of the facts when we have substantial resources of our own and our European partners know that? We are aggravating them. I will give one specific example because it affects the Taoiseach's constituency as well as the entire country. I refer to the attitude held by the Commission with regard to the urban designated areas and in particular the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with that understanding. I attend the meetings and I know the views of our European partners. The Commission is not aggravated. They see that we had growth of 8 or 9 per cent last year. In terms of the docks in my own constituency, they see that an acre of land there was sold for something in the order of £30 million. Deputy Quinn will probably remember the price and will know the site to which I am referring. At the same time we argue that we need capital allowances and double rent and rates reliefs. That is what people cannot understand. I think Deputy Quinn will agree that it is difficult to convince someone that if a buyer pays more than £10 million for an acre of land he needs allowances to develop it profitably. That is what aggravates our European partners, not the fact that we are arguing for Structural and Cohesion <Col N="1215" /> Funds. Every country is involved in this debate. Rent relief is an issue in every European country. Commissioner Monti is doing precisely the same thing &ndash; trying to close down what he believes are State aids &ndash; throughout the Community. There is no aggravation. He is dealing with the matter dispassionately and as he sees fit.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the question is being presented as one of Ireland against the rest of the Community. That is not the case. We will lose EU resources because of the relative wealth of our country. When we joined the Community 25 years ago our income was approximately 54 per cent of that of the average for the rest of Europe. It is now more than 90 per cent. That is the reason fewer resources will be transferred to us. In the meantime we must try to ensure that, in the transition arrangements, we get an equitable transfer and that the regions of Ireland which have not benefited continue to receive help.</P>
      <P>There is consensus in the House that the west and the Border region should retain Objective One status. There may be some argument about the midlands and about Clare and Kerry but by and large these areas can put forward a very good case for the retention of Objective One status until 2006 when the position will be reviewed. That is our negotiating position. It is an entirely logical and credible case. It creates no more difficulty in Brussels than that of any other country and I will continue to fight it for the next two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that to make a credible case in Brussels we must be credible at home? To be credible at home we must demonstrate that we are prepared to invest resources which we currently possess into the one area where we have a manifest deficit. I refer to our roads infrastructure, particularly at the primary level. The Taoiseach has referred to areas as being disadvantaged. Would the Taoiseach not agree that the one thing which would transform them would be a massive capital investment in primary roads?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the budget we banked a surplus of just less than £1 billion, yet we provided only £400 million for this area. To use the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; which the Taoiseach put on the order, does he agree that our credibility in addressing issues of regional disadvantage with the resources we possess is diminished by the way we present our case in Brussels? As a consequence, every urban renewal scheme throughout the country is virtually a year behind because of the changed attitude in the Commission. Something that the RTE correspondent in Brussels said would have gone through as a technicality has now become a major blocking instrument. Will the Taoiseach offer an explanation as to why the attitude in Brussels has <Col N="1216" /> changed so profoundly or does he believe it has changed?</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn will be aware that the one fear in Brussels last year was that the Minister's increase of 27 per cent in the capital programme for 1998 and of in excess of 30 per cent for 1999 would overheat the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They made that point, particularly on the capital side. I agree the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment and Local Government should continue to press ahead with the road projects. The NRA programme published last month details approximately 20 projects under construction, under detailed planning or ready to start. To his credit, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has been pushing to speed up capital programmes. With the greatest respect, it is neither because of a lack of money nor because the Government desire it that these projects are delayed. A project on the airport road is the subject of a court case because of a row over whether the swans will move off it. Work on the Port Tunnel project is held up because engineers cannot convince members of the public concerned that their houses will not fall into a hole when work begins on the tunnel.</P>
      <P>These matters, not a lack of resources, are delaying some of the infrastructural projects. I believe these matters are a good deal of nonsense, but money is available to deal with them. Other objectors include people who are trying to protect their gardens. Those and other issues are holding up major infrastructural projects. People are entitled to their say in a democracy and sometimes they may have too much of a say. People are swinging out of trees along the south-eastern motorway delaying work on that project. If we can overcome these difficulties, we will be able to proceed with building this infrastructure. I would be pleased if we could do that.</P>
      <P>I do not accept we are in difficulties on our negotiating position with Brussels. We have every right to argue for an equitable distribution of funding and we will do that. That is the right thing to do. Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, expressed his view on how we should proceed on the integrated areas plans, which have been held up. Brussels is being unfair on this, but I believe we can move ahead on it. The Minister of State said he would proceed on the residential aspects of these plans. We should be able to reach a conclusion on this matter. Given what the Commission has been saying recently, it is fairly obvious what the outcome of those discussions will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a feeling among people in the towns which are seeking necessary urban renewal that these applications were lumped in with the Dublin docks site, which is a different type of project. Will the Taoiseach agree that it is unfair to the small towns throughout the country awaiting designation that Brussels has blocked such approval because of detailed requirements for the site in Dublin outlined by the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. The Government did not lump these projects together, members of the Commission did. They took the 12 acre extension on the Dublin docks, which is an important development, the remainder of the designated areas in Dublin and other cities, the IAPs, the seaside resort and the Minister, Deputy Woods's seafarers' proposal and started arbitrating on them, and that was unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with regionalisation because this happened last January. Approval was given for the enterprise zones last January and in February they did not give approval for the 12 acre site. The Government will move forward on the residential aspect of the IAPs. Approximately 70 per cent of them are residential. There is a difficulty with residential units over shops which are to be found in many towns throughout the country, but hopefully we will have an answer on that soon. The Commission's view on rent relief and allowances is fairly obvious. It is clear that it is more positive about capital allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, I established in mid-1998 the strategic review group for the Irish film industry with representation from a broad spectrum of the industry with the objective of preparing for my consideration recommendations for a strategic plan for the industry for the first decade of the millennium. This group has been working intensively and its final report is now imminent. During the course of its deliberations the group has met key groups and agencies, public and private, who are involved in this important sector.</P>
      <P>I also assembled a panel of international experts who met last November for a three day discussion forum with the group. It is my intention to publish the group's report and I have no doubt it will be a key contribution to the development of policies to facilitate the growth and consolidation of a self-sustaining Irish film industry which will be well placed to seize the advantage of technological developments which are already radically changing the face of the audiovisual marketplace.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in accordance with the programme for Government, I have established the Screen Commission of Ireland on an operational basis. In this regard, I will be travelling to the United States later this month to attend the Locations Expo in Los Angeles at which the Screen Commission of Ireland will have a stand. In the course of my visit, I intend to have follow-up meetings with the various film companies I met on my visit there last April. I will take that opportunity to signal to the American audiovisual sector the Government's strong commitment to the continued development of the Irish film industry as a vital element of Ireland's cultural and industrial policy.</P>

      <P>The final report will be ready very shortly. When I set up the strategic group I asked it to examine the tax incentives as a priority and to examine their long-term effects on the film industry. It submitted an interim report on the impact of tax concessions, what used to be known as section 35, which the Deputy correctly referred to as section 481. I look forward to its final report which will examine all aspects of the film industry, including education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the interim report's analysis of section 481? Did it recommend its continuation? How is it possible for the Minister to travel to Los Angeles to the film expo and attempt to promote the Irish film Industry as a <Col N="1219" /> vital element of our economy, given that she is not in a position to state to would-be investors that section 481 is being restored not for one year but for three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider the Deputy opposite believes I am naive enough to discuss whether section 481 will feature in the Finance Bill. It must be published before any discussion can take place on it. However, I stated at the last Question Time the importance of section 481. This has been considered and certain views and recommendations were put forward.</P>
      <P>I was asked by the think tank to commission the Indecon report on its behalf, which was done. That report will be published, so the Deputy will have an opportunity of seeing the exact recommendations which were put forward. We will have to wait and see the outcome of those deliberations and those of the Minister for Finance. As the Deputy knows, section 481 is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the Minister of Finance of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the concerns expressed by Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan about the perceived very high costs of filming in Ireland? Will she take into account the example of a company in Galway called Magma, which is to make a £5.6 million drama series this year but which has indicated that without section 481 it will not be able to recruit 40 full-time permanent Irish employees?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the deep concern that is being expressed throughout the entire industry, which has 4,000 full-time employees and up to 4,000 part-time employees, about these high costs? For example, some electricians can earn up to £2,000 per week during filming. The consequence of that is that major documentaries and blockbusters are being filmed in Great Britain instead of Ireland. Is the Minister concerned about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the concerns which have been expressed in the industry about section 481, I am aware that section 481 is an extremely important element of the film industry. I am concerned about the views which have been put forward by those working in the industry.</P>
      <P>I see the screen commission playing a very important part in the indigenous industry here and in promoting Ireland as a location and a centre of excellence. That obviously covers the whole area of building an indigenous industry, which would also have very important ancillary industries and jobs coming on stream, in the form of crafts and other employment opportunities. We can be proud of this industry, which was small but is growing very rapidly. I am very aware of the take-up rate of section 481 and its importance in the building of an indigenous industry.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is due to be published on 11 February and the Minister is due to travel to Los Angeles at the end of the month. Is it her intention to use the undoubted economic advantage and the leverage of being able to say that section 481 is available for investors, once the Finance Bill is published? Does she intend to do that promotion on the basis that it would be included in whatever form in the Finance Bill, as published, before she leaves?</P>
      <P>The indications from the Department of Finance, which appears to be against this despite the Minister's best wishes, are that it might grudgingly concede the inclusion of section 481 for one further year. That should not be tolerated by the Minister under any circumstances. It should be included for a minimum of three or five years, so that long-term investment decisions and budgets can be made well in advance.</P>

I am sure we can then look forward to a further in-depth discussion on section 481 and many other aspects of that Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am going to Los Angeles as part of the screen commission's thrust for the film industry in the United States, particularly in Los Angeles. I will be promoting Ireland as a location and a centre of excellence. It is most important that we take these opportunities to promote the facilities we have here, in order to see further prosperity in the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 183 of 14 October 1998 and Question No. 3 of 15 October 1998 on the subject of digital broadcasting.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department is in consultation with RTE, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation regarding the draft text of the necessary legislation to provide for a statutory regime which will facilitate the early introduction in Ireland of digital broadcasting services, in particular digital terrestrial television, DTT.</P>
      <P>I expect to appoint consultants in the immediate future to advise the interdepartmental project management group on the selection of a partner for RTE to form the commercial entity which will be responsible for the provision of transmission and technical facilities to broadcasters in the new digital era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> As I indicated before, I hope that DTT services will be available in the middle or latter half of the year 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the appointment of the consultants to which the Minister referred being done on a tender basis? What is the remit of the consultants who are to be appointed? Is there a timescale for their report, in terms of the wording of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals are currently being drafted, as I am sure the Deputy is aware. Matters are very advanced in that regard and it is hoped to publish the proposals at the end of this month or March. The usual tendering process is under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the current position in regard to Digico? Are the projected savings accruing from this because of the partnership which RTE proposed to enter into? Does the Minister know when that might become operational?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking here about what is known for working purposes as the Digico situation. It will be established with responsibility for the provision of digital transmission capacity on a commercial basis for broadcasters, and for the future development of a digital terrestrial broadcasting platform for the benefit of the information society.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware, from our previous discussions on the question of digital, that Digico will assume responsibility for RTE's existing transmission facilities, and other transmission facilities provided by RTE for other broadcasts under contract. RTE will have a shareholding of up to 40 per cent in Digico in return for the facilities in existing businesses which will be assumed by this new entity.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group has been established to oversee the establishment of Digico. As I said in my initial reply, I am in the process of engaging consultants to advise the group on all aspects of the establishment of this new entity, including the suitability of potential candidates to take a shareholding in the new entity, having regard to Government policy on broadcasting.</P>

      <P>What is the position in regard to the new broadcasting regulator? This is the new body which is to assume the responsibilities of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the current Broadcasting Complaints Commission. When is it likely to be set up and how far advanced is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister decided on the use of the six multiplexes which are to be set up under the digital system? RTE will have access to one and TnaG and TV3 will have access to another one. What will happen to the other four multiplexes? How are they to be used? It annoys me intensely that TV3, which operates under a licence with <Col N="1222" /> controls from the Department and the Independent Radio and Television Commission, has snubbed the Minister, this House and the people of Ireland, in that not a single word of the Irish language is heard on that station. Under its remit or contract it is bound by law to carry some elements of the Irish language. It is, after all, beaming into Gaeltacht areas. The Minister should look at that question to see if under the remit allocated to TV3 it might concern itself to some extent with this matter. After all, it is being viewed by people with very strong views who want to associate all our indigenous channels with the Irish language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With the introduction of digital services I intend to expand greatly the powers of what is now known as the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The broad function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission will become, first, to make arrangements in accordance with the provisions of the proposed Bill for the provision of sound and television broadcasting services, additional to any such services provided by RTE and Teilifís na Gaeilge. Second, the commission is required to endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services best serve the needs of the people bearing in mind our traditions and culture. Also, the commission may, as part of the arrangements I referred to already, guarantee access for the broadcasting services, or part thereof, of broadcasters established in the North, provided that equitable, reciprocal arrangements are made by the British authorities in respect of the transmission of services of RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3.</P>
      <P>There will be other detailed additional functions of the commission with regard to assessing general programming standards in consultation with RTE. When these have been drawn up they will apply to analogue as well as digital services.</P>
      <P>From time to time, we will have to draw up, publish and amend codes of broadcasting, advertising and sponsorship. The control of advertising time on all television services, with the exception of free to air services of RTE and Teilifís na Gaeilge &ndash; including power to permit certain advertising techniques and advertisements during certain times on all or certain services &ndash; will also be looked at. We will also draw up codes for what used to be known as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. That is just a flavour of the extra powers that will be given, under the new digital system, to the expanded Independent Radio and Television Commission as the regulatory body.</P>
      <P>TV3 is a commercial station and, therefore, cannot be viewed in the same way as RTE or TnaG. I share the Deputy's interest in wishing to see further Irish programming on TV3. I made that wish known publicly at the launch of TV3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the remit and contract of TV3 is not my concern as Minister, but that of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. It is the commission's business and, therefore, I <Col N="1223" /> have no say with regard to the content of such contracts.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 42, 65 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to the development of a national heritage plan and to local heritage plans. As Minister with primary responsibility in relation to heritage, I have initiated the preparation of a national heritage plan. My Department has recently completed a broad public consultation process on the development of the plan and the 350 submissions received are currently being examined and assessed by the Department.</P>
      <P>A parallel preparatory process is under way within my Department, including the analysis I already referred to and an overview of current management of heritage, with critical assessment of proposals for action. It is intended that these processes will be completed by mid-February and further detailed analysis of all the issues arising will be commenced, including cross-departmental consultation.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the national heritage plan will provide the framework for the development of local heritage plans and will enable detailed consideration to be given to the process to be adopted in advancing the development of local heritage plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question on the official definition of heritage, I assume the Deputy is raising this question in the context of the Government's commitment to the development of the national heritage plan. The terms of reference of the plan are to develop a national plan for the protection, conservation, management and presentation of <Col N="1224" /> the national heritage, the architectural and archaeological &ndash; both moveable and immovable &ndash; heritage, the inland waterways of the State, and documentary and archival heritage.</P>
    <P>Aspects of the national heritage coming within the scope of the plan will include: natural heritage, including flora and fauna, habitats, geological features and other biodiversity elements, particularly in the context of the national biodiversity plan; archaeological heritage, including archaeological sites, monuments, areas, landscapes, artefacts/objects on land and under water; architectural, artistic and historic heritage, including buildings, structures, parks, gardens and objects of architectural, artistic and historic importance; natural and cultural landscapes; inland waterways; and documentary and archival heritage, including traditional music archives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that her Department has been working to date without any definitive definition of heritage? The terms of reference of the surveys carried out are of interest, but what is the official definition of heritage in her Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy O'Shea on becoming the Labour Party's spokesperson for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I am sure we will have an opportunity to spar on occasions.</P>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's immediate question, I gave an all-embracing definition of the whole area of heritage in my reply when I referred to the scope of the national heritage plan. To recap, it concerns natural heritage, archaeological heritage, architectural, artistic and historical heritage, natural and cultural landscapes, inland waters, documentary and archival heritage. If anything has been left out of that list I would be delighted to hear from the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that decision. I hope and envisage that a national heritage plan will influence all the work being done at local level. I have always believed in a plan that involves a bottom-up approach. It is most important to have co-ordination at local level and not something that is simply trotted out from time to time at national level as Government policy. That is why the Department, at my instigation, ensured that there would be proper and all embracing consultation with the general public to see how they want us to translate our heritage into a national plan. With 350 submissions having been made we will get that kind of general and all-embracing approach.</P>

      <P>Given that the British-Irish Agreement brings together important areas concerning the national heritage plan, are these submissions being made on an all-Ireland, all-island basis, or are they confined to the Twenty-six Counties? Is it intended that the national plan will be implemented throughout the 32 Counties? What staff levels are available to the Minister to examine 350 submissions? When these have been examined at the end of this month, will the Minister explain the mechanics and time-scale involved before the plan can be finalised and presented as a working programme?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the arts, inland water and the Irish language will be under discussion in the North-South talks that are taking place at official level. In those areas particularly, we want to see what can be done as a priority about further co-ordination. After all, we are a very small country and the arts still concerns a small community. I want to see as much co-operation between the two parts of the island as possible. That matter is being worked on.</P>
      <P>Regarding staffing, the Deputy, who previously served in Government, is aware that there is never enough staff to deal with all the issues that require attention. I congratulate the members of my staff who have worked particularly hard in perusing all the submissions and who will have them correlated by mid-February. The next step in the plan will be to consider the issue of cross-departmental consultation. I hope that will not take too long and there will be no delay on my part because I want to be in a position to implement the plan at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>This morning the Taoiseach indicated that work on a Bill dealing with the establishment of a new body to cover inland waterways, heritage and language is well advanced. Will the Minister confirm that is the position? I addressed the Taoiseach in the vernacular and I am not sure he understood my point. Is legislation well advanced regarding the new cross-Border activities in this area?</P>

      <P>I welcome the national and local heritage plans, but I am concerned about the position while plans are being drawn up and proposals put in place. I am aware of heritage sites of great national importance which are deteriorating rapidly. They cannot wait for plans to be drawn up. Are any contingency powers available to the Minister to intervene in such cases and at least <Col N="1226" /> stop the rot in terms of the deterioration of sites? This would mean that sites were repaired to the extent that they could wait for the provision of funds for full restoration in the future.</P>

      <P>Ireland is particularly lucky to have so many sites which need attention from my Department and individuals in the case of private monuments. However, we do not have as much finance as we would wish. We take in hand as many buildings that are at risk as possible in terms of available resources. If the Deputy has any specific buildings in mind, I will be delighted to discuss them with him. I will be in a position to give a further response not only in relation to visitor sites but also the Department's approach regarding general monuments when I reply to a later question.</P>

        <b>:</b> Cuireann sin ní amháin díomá ach déistin orm agus cuireann sé in iúl dúinn an fhadhb atá againn leis an cheist seo. An bhfuil fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil imní rí-mhór ar an-chuid daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh di faoin tionchar a bheadh ag scéimeanna móra tithíochta saoire ar an nGaeltacht, ó thaobh comhshaoil agus timpeallachta, ó thaobh cultúir agus ó thaobh tionchar ar an dteanga féin.</P>

Tá an tAire ag rá linn inniu nach bhfuil aon pholasaí cinnte acu faoi scéimeanna móra den tsaghas seo sa Ghaeltacht. Nach faillí uafásach é seo agus nach dtugann sé <i>carte blanche </i>do lucht speiciúiléireachta tabhairt faoi cheantair Ghaeltachta fé mar a thabharfaidís faoi aon cheantar eile chun brabús mór a dhéanamh?</P>

Baineann cúrsaí chomhshaoil go ginearálta leis an Aire Comhshaoil agus tá mé cinnte go mbeadh seisean breá sásta an cheist áirithe sin a fhreagairt duit. Is léir anois gurb é an rud atá ag déanamh tinnis duit ná an tionchar a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ag forbairt mar seo ar an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Más é sin atá i gceist agat is mór an trua nach í sin an cheist a cuireadh, ach freagroidh mé an cheist sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí mise i mo bhall de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe agus le linn dom a bheith i mo bhall thóg an Chomhairle cúram orthu féin roinnt rudaí a dhéanamh.

Dá gcuirfeá ceist ormsa mar dhuine a bhfuil comhnaí air sa Ghaeltacht, cad é an rud is mó atá ag déanamh dochar don teanga sa Ghaeltacht, ní hiad na scéimeanna tithe saoire ach an brú mar shampla ar mo cheantar féin ó mhéadú bhruachbhailte chathair na Gaillimhe amach go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Tá mo Roinnse ag plé na ceiste sin go láidir leis an Roinn Comhshaoil. Táimid buartha go ginearálta faoin tionchar atá ag cúrsaí pleanála tithíochta agus cúrsaí forbartha de chineálacha eile ar an Ghaeltacht.

      <P>Tá Bille nua ag teacht amach agus tá aighneacht déanta ag mo Roinn faoin mBille sin. Tríd an Coiste eadar-Rannach Gaeltachta tá comhráití taréis a bheith ar bun idir an Roinn Comhshaoil agus mo Roinnse i dtaobh na ceiste seo. Maidir le cúrsaí pleanála sa Ghaeltacht go ginearálta, glacaim leis go mór go bhfuil tionchar nach beag ag cúrsaí pleanála ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta. Mar bhall de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe bhí mé páirteach in éineacht le mo chomhleacaithe i gcur isteach coinníollacha teanga don chéad uair.  Ach tá ceist difriúil curtha ag an Teachta sa cheist a chuir sé orm, sé sin ceist tionchar scéimeanna tithíochta ar an teanga sa Ghaeltacht. Sin rud a bhaineann le mo chúram sa Roinn. An freagra atá agamsa ar sin ná go bhfuilimid le fada, sna hOileáin Árainn, mar shampla, ag tabhairt isteach turasóirí. Fanann siad go háitiúil agus is Béarla is mó a úsáideann na turasóirí seo. An cheist atá ann ná cén dochar atá á dhéanamh acu nó nach bhfuil á dhéanamh acu don teanga. Creidimse go pearsanta go bhfuil oll-thurasóireacht ag déanamh dochar don teanga scaití agus go gcaithfimid a bheith cúramach faoi seo. Tá sin ráite míle uair agam ach ag an am céanna ní chreidim gurb iad na turasóirí atá ag scrios na teanga. Mar níl áit sa tír a bhfuil an teanga níos láidre ná sna hOileáin Árainn ainneoin gurb í an áit is mó, b'fhéidir, a bhfuil turasóirí ag teacht ann. Sé mo thaithí féin i mo cheantar féin gur cuinsí eile seachas tithe saoire atá ag déanamh dochar don teanga. Chun an fhírinne a insint duit, ceann de na gearáin a bhíonn ag daoine i mo cheantar faoi na tithe saoire ná nach mbíonn páirt nó láimh acu leis an ceantar. Tagann siad le rudaí sa charr, imíonn siad leo gan airgead a chaitheamh sa cheantar nó gan meascadh le muintir an cheantair. Ní bhíonn tionchar dá laghad, olc maith nó dona acu ar an áit. Sin iad na gearáin a bhíonn ag daoine ach níorbh é sin údar na ceiste agus caithfidh mé a mhíniú arís don Teachta dá mba rud é go raibh muidne ag tógáil ceiste faoi seo ón taobh Gaeltachta den Roinn &ndash; agus ba léir go raibh freagra faighte ón chuid eile den Roinn ar cheisteanna oidhreachta nádúrtha &ndash;  chaithfimis í a bhunú ar cheist teangeolaíochta. Ach ní léir dúinn bunaithe ar an cheist teoranta sin go ndéanann sé seo mórán difríochta ó thaobh na teanga de. Chaithfeadh aon aighneacht a bheith bunaithe ar sin dá ndéanfaimís aighneacht agus ní léir dúinn go bhfuil an ceart ag an Teachta.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil dhá rud ráite ag an Teachta atá glan contráilte dá chéile. Glacaim leis ó thaobh airgid de gur tairbhí i bhfad don Ghaeltacht lóistín agus tithe ósta. Mar nuair a thagann daoine go dtí teach saoire ní bhíonn aon bhaint acu le muintir na háite. Ach caithfidh duine glacadh leis freisin, ó tharla go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó cumarsáide daonna i dteach lóistin nó i dteach ósta leis an phobal áitiúil, gur mó an tionchar teanga a bheadh á imirt ag na stráinséirí sa chás sin ná mar a bheadh dá mbeidís ag teacht go teach saoire, áit nach mbeidís ag plé leis an phobal. Ní féidir leis a bheith ag dul ar an dá bhealach. Mar a mhínigh me cheana, taréis go mb'fhéidir go n-aontaím leis i gcuid de na rudaí atá ráite aige, dá mbeadh ceist tógtha ag an Roinn is ar bhonn teanga a chaithfimis í a thógáil. Níl aon fheidhm againn taobh amuigh de sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an ngeallúint a d'iarr tú orm, níl mé chun an gheallúint sin a thabhairt inniu don Dáil. Mar a mhínigh mé dó cheana, tá aighneachtaí déanta go hinmheánach againn.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt mé leis an Teachta cheana go bhfuil pleanáil go ginearálta mar údar imní dom sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil comhráití taréis a bheith idir an dá Roinn faoin cheist seo. Ach chomhairleoinn dó gurb é an rud gur chóir do Chomhairle Chontae Chiarraí a dhéanamh ná Corca Dhuibhne agus Uibh Ráthach a chosaint mar Ghaeltachtaí agus tá an bun-fhreagracht sin orthu. Lab<Col N="1230" /> hartar go minic sa tír seo faoi faoi cumhachtaí a thabhairt do na húdaráis áitiúla. Sin an áit ar cheart an job seo a bheith déanta. Ní fhéadfadh an Teachta rud níos fearr a dhéanamh ná áiteamh ar mhuintir Chiarraí, na daoine áitiúla, breathnú ar phlean Chontae na Gaillimhe agus na srianta atá curtha i bhfeidhm do na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus do na ceantair fíor álainne, a léamh agus cuid de na rudaí fíor-chiallmhaire a chuiremar isteach i bplean Chontae na Gaeillimhe a thógaint ar bord.

      <P>Is ceist an-réasúnta í sin agus mar a dúirt mé tá mé buartha. Níl aon amhras faoi ach go bhfuil fíor-thionchar á imirt. I mo cheantar Gaeltachta féin i gConamara is measa an tionchar atá á imirt ag fadhbanna pleanála agus forbairt na cathrach ag bogadh isteach sa Ghaeltacht is láidre sa tír. Bhí mé ag breathnú ar na figiúirí sin aréir agus tá an Ghaeltacht is láidre faoi bhrú trí chúrsaí pleanála. Tá na ceisteanna seo ar fad tógtha cheana féin leis an Roinn Comhshaoil ach tá próiseas go gcaithfidh duine a leanúint i gcúrsaí rialtais. Beidh Bille nua ag teacht amach agus beidh mo Roinnse ag déanamh aighneachtaí mar a dheineann chuile Roinn má tá Bille á réiteach.

Is ceist í seo atá á scrúdú go leanúnach i gcomhthéacs na mBillí seo atá á réiteach. Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte de gurb é an aidhm atá ann ná breathnú ar gach rud atá ag cur as don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus moltaí a dhéanamh faoin dochar atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair.</P>

Go dtí gur chuir muidne i gComhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe cuinsí teanga isteach sa phlean chontae an uair dheireannach go raibh aithbhreithniú á dhéanamh air go bhfios dom níor cuireadh riamh cuinsí teanga isteach sa phróiseas pleanála. Mar sin, dá mbeadh a leithéid á dhéanamh ba rud as an nua é. Ach mura mbeadh a leithéid de fhoráil ann ní fhéadfadh éinne an rud a bhí ag teastáil ón Teachta Ó hUiginn a dhéanamh. Ní bheadh aon chumhacht ann é a dhéanamh. Ní bheadh aon fheidhm leis. Mar sin tá an Roinn againne ag scrúdú na ceiste sin agus tá comhráití ar bun. D'fhéadfadh sé tárlú go gcaithfimid breathnú, más fiú dúinn airgead a chaitheamh ar an Ghaeltacht, an fiú dúinn í a chosaint ó phleanáil nach bhfuil feiliúnach. Táimid ag éirí i bhfad níos géire, mar shampla, ó thaobh na hoidhreachta nádúrtha. Ní féidir leat fiú amháin bóithre a thógaint in áiteanna anois más ceantair speisialta oidhreachta atá ionntu. Luífeadh sé le réasún, más fiú dúinn an oidhreacht sin a chaomhnú tríd an gcóras pleanála, ar a laghad go scrúdófaí na féidireachtaí agus ceist na teanga a thógaint san áireamh i gcás na Gaeltachta. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil ar a laghad modh nó model againn den rud go bhféadfaí a dhéanamh sa rud a rinne Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe nuair a thug siad isteach an plean contae deiridh.

        <b>: </b>Luaigh an tAire plean forbartha Chontae na Gaillimhe mar shampla d'údaráis áitiúla eile ó thaobh chaomhnú na Gaeltachta de. An nglacfadh an tAire leis go bhfuil difríochtaí móra idir na húdaráis éagsúla ar fud na tíre fé mar a chuireann siad i bhfeidhm, abair, rialacha maidir le forbairt sa Ghaeltacht? Nach nglacfadh sé leis gur cheart go mbeadh slat-mhéadar cinnte, nó an slat-mhéadar céanna maidir le ceisteanna trom-chúiseacha a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht, ag gach údarás áitiúil? Nach nglacfadh sé leis, mar sin, gurb é dualgas Aire na Gaeltachta a chinntiú go mbeadh an slat-mhéadar cinnte seo curtha i bhfeidhm agus go nglacfadh agus go gcloífeadh na húdaráis áitiúla leis? Sin é an fáth gur iarras ar an Aire geallúint a thabhairt don Dáil go ndéanfadh sé amhlaidh sa reachtaíocht atá le teacht.</P>

      <P>Tuigim gur ball de údarás áitiúil an Teachta. Ar an Mháirt agus ar an Déardaoin ba mhaith le gach duine go dtabharfaí tuilleadh cumhachtaí do na húdaráis áitiúla i dtreo is go bhféadfadh na húdaráis a dhéanamh de réir mar a cheapann siadsan is fearr a dhéanamh dá gcontae féin. Ach ar an gCéadaoin agus ar an Aoine nuair a fheileann sé dóibh athraíonn sin ar fad agus teastaíonn uathu gach cumhacht a thabhairt ar ais don Aire agus glacadh le gach rud ó Bhaile Átha Cliath. Tá sé in am againn sa tír seo teacht ar chinneadh, an dteastaíonn uainn go dtiocfadh gach rud ó Bhaile Átha Cliath agus dearmad a dhéanamh ar réigiúnachas, ar dhéabhlóid agus tuilleadh cumhachtaí d'údaráis áitiúla nó an bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoi seo?</P>

Ciallaíonn sé sin go mba cheart go mbeadh sé i ngach plean chontae go ndéanfaí cosaint ar shaíocht agus ar chultúr na Gaeltachta.

      <P>It is not unusual that this situation should arise. Many of the institutions under the aegis of my Department receive private donations for a variety of projects and activities and these are managed by the institutions themselves. I do not get involved in the day to day management of these institutions. As to why some private donors wish to remain anonymous, I am advised that donors who contribute to worthy public projects such as the gallery extension often do not wish their names to be made public for a <Col N="1233" /> variety of legitimate reasons which might include a decision to announce the donation at a particular time for commercial marketing reasons or a desire not to be approached by others seeking donations for different projects or causes.</P>
      <P>I have the utmost confidence in the integrity of the chairman and the board of governors and guardians of the National Gallery. On foot of newspaper and media stories that abounded some time ago, at the end of November the chairman of the board of governors and guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland gave all the information I sought.

The recent situation with regard to the budget figure for which tenders have been invited, totalling £14.7 million, can be met from existing funds, that is, £7.5 million in EU funds, £2 million in Exchequer funds and £5 million in private donations. I am sure the Deputies opposite will agree that the whole Clare Street project is something we all look forward to because we have a wonderful collection and it is important that there should be even greater access to it by the general public.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has an ongoing wildlife monitoring programme in place which carries out regular surveys of our wildlife, both flora and fauna. Endangered or protected wildlife receive priority under this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to specific schemes relating to species such as the corncrake, the grey partridge, the roseate tern and the hen harrier, the designation and protection of special protection areas and special areas of conservation will contribute sig<Col N="1234" /> nificantly to the maintenance of suitable habitats for these and other species of wild birds. This, together with the environmental benefits from improved farm practices under the rural environment protection scheme, will represent a significant benefit for the protection of our wildlife, including birds.</P>

The Minister mentioned several species which are in danger and which are being monitored, such as the hen harrier.

I wonder if sufficient resources exist and if not, whether the Minister intends bolstering that section of her Department to ensure we know what is happening.</P>

      <P>The Deputies can fight that out among themselves.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has responsibility in this regard and has an ongoing wildlife monitoring programme in place which carries out regular surveys on all aspects of our wildlife, both flora and fauna. If the Deputy has any particular species in mind &ndash; he has already mentioned some which are causing particular concern &ndash; I will try to furnish him with the details of research or survey data available to me. I am sure the Deputy is aware of the publication of the red data books on which Dúchas has extensively collaborated in recent years. These provide a very useful guide to many of the threatened species of wildlife and their conservation status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that publication of the Dúchas bulletin on a regular basis would be an excellent idea and would allow us know what is happening? I read these titbits of <Col N="1235" /> information, which I use to put down questions, in the Sunday newspapers such as the<i> Sunday Tribune</i>, which for some reason carries such titbits. If it were not for such sources, I would not know what is going on in the countryside. I find it objectionable that whatever monitoring is taking place is not recorded and passed on to the general public. I am asking that a bulletin be issued telling us the state of play in the context of various species, particularly those which are endangered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy, that information is already to hand in the red data books and that is why Dúchas collaborates extensively in providing that extra information. The Deputy will be interested to know that there is every intention to carry out further surveys. For example, major surveys have been undertaken or are planned in relation to the following species: badger, countryside birds, raised bogs, Greenland white fronted geese, grey partridge, Irish wetlands birds, blanket bogs, corncrake, tern, the hen harriers and others. If the Deputy wishes to table questions or write me a note inquiring about specific species I will do my best to see he gets the information.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy's comments are commendable in the context of information being available to the general public who have an interest in the matter. Does the monitoring which takes place &ndash; those whom I know undertake it are very good &ndash; take into account any analysis of what happens at landfill sites where there are vermin and all kinds of pollutants as a result of agricultural sprays? For example, over this winter have there been any reports of endangered species being shot or trapped?</P>

If the Deputies have any evidence or are particularly worried about any situation I would welcome direct contact from them. Regarding making information available, of course I would like to see the provision of further moneys, but we all realise that when we do not have the amount of moneys at hand which we would like, we must deal with the difficulties which arise in ensuring threats to endangered species are immediately addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying we have been waiting a long time &ndash; between ten and 12 years &ndash; for an amendment to the Wildlife Act. I hope to be in a position to publish the amending legislation, which is very lengthy, very shortly. There are some legal issues being worked out with the office of the Attorney General prior to publication. As soon as these issues are addressed the Bill will be published. I envisage the Bill will address a number of the issues already referred to by Deputies. The Deputy rightly talks about looking afresh at how we can deal with these issues and the bio-diversity plan can certainly be used as a new starting point to ensure threatened species are looked after. Not only can we identify but we can monitor and protect endangered species under the bio-diversity plan which, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, is well under way.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the recruitment of an additional 30 wildlife rangers which is currently under way. This will help protect and conserve the situation on the ground.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate Matters. - Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Western society is plagued by a series of addictions but the one which affects us all, whether we are allowed to live among the wealth of the rich countries or in the developing world, is our addiction to finite resources. Nowhere is this more true as in our obsessive use of electricity. We live in a society which craves electricity. Even the offices which many of us occupy in Kildare House depend on air conditioning as the windows are sealed. We see our children turning from traditional toys to computer games and battery powered Furbies. Electricity seems to underpin these trends.</P>
      <P>We must think seriously about how we can provide most efficiently the cleanest energy to the most consumers be it to industry or our homes. The Minister said this Bill will take into account environmental concerns. I am not sure whether she is referring to a gesture in the direction of environmental issues while concentrating on profits which private companies will be anxious to glean from this development and liberalisation or whether she has in mind sustainability and the activities in which the electricity industry would involve itself in being sustainable. Somehow I believe it is the former.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will enable the liberalisation of the national utilities. We saw this happen in other places. We probably know most about Margaret Thatcher's Britain and the mixed results there. In Margaret Thatcher's heyday we saw water, train services, electricity and mines fall into the hands of the highest bidders. Inevitably, it is harder to control a private company operating with a strict profit motive rather than those which operate with the public good in mind. In Britain this is evident in the privatised sector where the quality <Col N="1239" /> of water supply is dangerously unpredictable. Indeed, English horticulture suffers from droughts almost every summer and the trains are equally unpredictable.</P>
    <P>The efficiency envisaged through privatisation has not always manifested itself regardless of what the mantra of the free marketeers might say. It has also had enormous human costs in redundancies and job losses. By letting foreign companies into the Irish market, we and the workers in the ESB need assurances that their jobs will be secure. If these assurances cannot be given, we must ask who is being served by this Government. The workers are not being served if that assurance is not given nor is the environment because the free market will not put it at the top of its priority list.</P>
    <P>We have seen the dedication of workers in the ESB, especially when the Christmas storms forced them from their Christmas break to provide the valuable service for those who were without power. It is also important that the individual consumers are protected when such a fundamental amenity is privatised. The most vulnerable in this situation are those who live in remote areas. If it is no longer financially viable to supply a service to a local area, there is an imperative need for the State to ensure that everyone is provided with a high quality service. We must not see a situation where people living in remote areas are forced to pay huge amounts for a basic and necessary service compared to those living in urban areas where competition is thriving and proportionately costs can be lower.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, deregulating the markets can have some positive effects. Examples may be seen in Britain where the market has been opened up and power producers may supply renewable energy to individual consumers. This Bill, however, shows the Government has rowed back on a number of positive assurances given by the previous Government in relation to renewable energy and that is of concern to that industry, as the Minister may know. These are tentative steps but they send the right signal to individual customers who want to make up their own minds about from where the electricity they use comes.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, individual households are allowed to choose what type of electricity they desire and are given the option of choosing energy from renewable sources. In this sense, deregulation can open up markets to those willing to supply energy from renewable and sustainable sources. Why has that not been followed in this jurisdiction? I will table a number of amendments to the Bill to ensure we do not slip and fail the renewable energy industry at this time.</P>
    <P>The sections which call for firm targets on how much energy must come from renewable sources are weak and inadequate. Giving the customer the choice creates the impetus for the electricity companies to buy electricity from independent green producers or to provide the renewable sus<Col N="1240" /> tainable energy themselves. This country has for too long relied on brown energy from burning of fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>The Government has, in accordance with the Kyoto protocol, committed itself to a reduction of the harmful greenhouse gases which are beginning to wreak havoc across the world. Ireland was given strict limits on its emission of greenhouses gases but already we have reached the target of 13 per cent over the 1990 levels. These levels were supposed to cover this country until the year 2012 and yet we have already broken that limit. We are seriously at odds with the commitments we gave. If Ireland does not put in place a proper greenhouse abatement strategy, we will exceed the 1990 levels by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent and will face the prospect of enormous costs in penalties.</P>
    <P>There are a number of causes for the emissions of greenhouse gases. Many of these greenhouse gases stem from energy sectors reliant on fossil fuels. As we heard at the electricity directive forum on 22 January of last year, the ESB is by far the largest contributor of CO2 and that imposes a huge responsibility on this legislation and the energy sector. Ireland's failure to reduce CO2 and the emissions of other greenhouse gases will be deadly for future generations both here and elsewhere. Already, the issue of rising sea levels is having an impact on our coast. I have just come off the telephone having spoken to people in Malahide who have noticed damage to the coast which was not there before. Higher sea levels are obvious when the weather turns bad, and that is another aspect of global warming which is not being sufficiently acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The Chernobyl disaster showed us how air emissions and environmental destruction knows no national borders. In that regard, we have an international as well as a national obligation in terms of this legislation. The price will not only be the environmental effects of such depletion of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect. It will also prove costly to the taxpayer when Ireland has to buy greenhouse gas credits to allow us continue to spew out toxic gases. To stop this nightmare scenario we need firm action from a number of Departments, not least from the Department in charge of controlling the electricity markets. By inviting large companies into Ireland to pursue big business with the promise of cheap energy, we are stepping away from the energy conservation goals we set.</P>
    <P>I met with the management of the ESB and a number of those at the meeting expressed concern as to who will continue carrying the responsibility for energy conservation when deregulation has brought about a liberalised market. The answer given by people in Government is the Irish Energy Centre, and that is supposed to be sufficient. I can tell the House, however, that the activities of the ESB in the area of energy conservation, from what I have seen, are much greater than any the Irish Energy Centre could hope to match. When I ask about legislation on <Col N="1241" /> the Irish Energy Centre I am told by the Taoiseach that it has been put on the long finger &ndash; perhaps to the end of the year 2000 &ndash; but we have heard those types of promises in relation to other legislation. There is a lack of seriousness when it comes to making provision for our huge obligations in relation to energy conservation.</P>
    <P>Any marketing strategy by a new competitor in the electricity market will use the supply of cheap electricity to attract new customers, but there is no such thing as cheap electricity since the devastating effects on the environment must be taken into account. There is always a price to pay in relation to the destruction of finite resources.</P>
    <P>Power producers hoping to gain a large market share in the deregulated marketplace will not tell the large companies that they can buy electricity from them at a cheap price and advise that they should try to use as little as possible. The ESB has had to promote energy awareness, not only to benefit customers financially but also to take responsible steps in relation to our environment. As a State body, the ESB has carried out this responsibility but with a number of interested companies the responsible attitude towards energy conservation may fall by the wayside in an effort to maximise profits.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre is still waiting for the necessary legislation to set it up on a statutory basis. Now, more than ever, there is a need for a body which will advise on and campaign for energy conservation and achieve the kinds of targets we promised would be achieved. In Scotland, a percentage of each electricity bill is set aside, with the customer's knowledge, for energy conservation. Groups like Energy Action, operating on a voluntary charitable basis for many years, need the necessary funding to make a realistic difference in our energy consumption.</P>
    <P>We must impress the importance of energy conservation on industry, which is the largest user of electricity in the State. As the Bill will open up the electricity market to the 300 largest users of power, this deregulation will benefit large companies that use vast amounts of power. On the other hand, the private customer is not given the right to buy green energy and is being asked to subsidise the ESB which will lose out on the deregulation. In California, where retail competition was introduced last March, competition transition charges account for nearly 30 per cent of residential bills. Should the individual customer be forced to subsidise over-use by the large energy users? </P>
    <P>Irish people rightly have a negative view of nuclear power. By opening up the European electricity market we may be supplied by French or British companies which draw their energy from nuclear sources. This opens up new markets to the nuclear industries and removes the pressure to reduce and decommission nuclear power plants throughout the European Union. It is vitally important that there are strong rules which make it clear that we do not want to import electricity produced in such a hazardous manner. I <Col N="1242" /> urge the Minister to ensure this policy is continued.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important also that when the household markets are opened up to competition there is proper legislation to enforce source labelling so that the consumer is aware at all times where and how the electricity has been generated. We know what it is like to live near nuclear installations without having a say as to how they are run or when they will be shut down.</P>
    <P>In increasing the number of electricity generators and distributors in Ireland there may also be a doubling or tripling of pylons and substations. We have seen community protests at the siting of communication masts. Bearing in mind the environmental and visual impacts of pylons and sub-stations, there should be strong legislation forcing new companies to co-locate their transmission equipment.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 27 to which Deputy Yates referred earlier, the Green Party agrees that this section restricts the possibilities of introducing green energy on a large scale. The Green Party will table amendments to the effect that the definition of &ldquo;final customer&rdquo; in section 27 should be changed. There are many instances where we have found that people want to purchase renewable electricity but do not conform to the criteria of the final customer. If a customer has any number of premises, he or she may not be seen as an eligible customer. This provision needs to be amended so that bodies such as health boards, banks and credit unions can buy together in order to give a large cash boost to renewable energy producers. If we are providing for liberalisation and increased consumer choice, it is crucially important that this applies to the individual customer or groups of customers who want to buy green electricity.</P>
    <P>Increased competition is the mantra of the neo-liberals who want to increase the choice of the customer. This is said to lead to a healthy marketplace. It is blatantly obvious that what might seem to be healthy to that unknown beast, the free market, is often destructive to the earth in general, its tenants and the future generations who will inhabit the planet. The Government should do everything in its power, through legislation and policy, to encourage the production and use of energy from renewable sources as well as maximum conservation of energy.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to note that an electricity generator supplying wind energy could supply a customer approximately 40 per cent of the time. Similar or lower figures apply in the case of hydro, wave and tidal energy.</P>
    <P>In order to supply the customer who has opted for energy from renewable sources, there is a need for the traditional and dominant brown energy suppliers to be compelled to make up the balance that cannot be supplied by the green energy producer. A customer who decides to opt for green energy will be billed with two invoices at the end of the month. The technology is readily <Col N="1243" /> available to allow for this switch from traditional brown energy to green energy.</P>
    <P>Renewable energies come in a random arrival pattern. The main positive aspects of renewable energy, however, is that the source is free. There is no ownership of the wind or the waves whereas oilfields are so heavily restricted they are a cause of military action. The exploitation of Irish boglands has destroyed over 80 per cent of a natural heritage unique to this country, a subject dealt with earlier by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>It makes sense to generate electricity in a way that is free and causes little or no pollution and health risks. Through the Bill the Government needs to strengthen its commitment to green energy by allowing for an amendment to compel traditional energy producers to supply the top-up electricity not supplied by the green energy producer. Unless the Bill takes into account the way the traditional brown energy suppliers will interact with the providers of renewable energy, the brown energy supplier can simply refuse to co-operate with the renewable energy supplier, and the latter will be left high and dry.</P>
    <P>If a customer decides to buy green electricity there must be regulation so that the traditional supplier does not simply cut off that user. Allowances must be made for the use of more than one source of electricity since the renewable energy sector will not be able to provide 100 per cent of electricity from the outset. It is important that legislation introduced to liberalise or deregulate the electricity market in Ireland should take into account the enormous impact of electricity generation on the environment. We must ensure that in opening up the markets we do not open the floodgates to nuclear power and the careless over-use of power by large companies. That places a huge responsibility on the Minister of State to ensure the Opposition amendments are carefully considered so that the future of the electricity industry in Ireland will help and not hinder our international obligations and our progress towards a sustainable future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is among the most important to have come before the House for some time. The issue of electricity provision, generation and distribution affects every individual in the State on an hourly and daily basis. Consequently, any proposed changes have a clear implication for the population at large. This legislation implements the EU directive on the deregulation and liberalisation of the electricity market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB has been a significant employer in my constituency. There are also significant and voluminous users of electricity in industries there. Most people in the House have memories of the introduction of rural electrification and the great social and economic change which it brought for many families in rural Ireland. It commenced in the latter half of the 1940s, continued through the 1950s and 1960s and was completed some time in <Col N="1244" /> the 1970s. This legislation will end the monopoly of the ESB in the power market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the Bill is the first of a series of amendments to other legislation needed to give full effect to what is proposed. Nonetheless, we all hope these changes will lead eventually to a reduction in overall charges, both to industry and households. Electricity costs are a significant element for many people, for example, dairy farmers, who milk cows and store the milk. This is only one small example of the daily use and total dependence on electricity. We only have to think back a few weeks to the Christmas period when, because of severe storms, large pockets of the country were without power for days and, in some cases in the north-east, for weeks. Our total dependence on electricity was graphically illustrated then. I pay tribute to ESB staff for their tremendous work in difficult weather conditions in getting power restored to many areas.</P>
    <P>While we can debate legislation to provide for new commissions and arrangements, we only get to the heart of the issue when we deal with the practical implementation of the Bill's objectives. The area of transmission and distribution will be very important as far as the new changes are concerned. There are groupings with economic clout or financial power interested in developing new generating stations. Clearly, they will not invest large sums of money in new generating stations unless there is a market which will provide an economic return for that investment. The Bill provides for public service obligations in those circumstances and that is important. There are large segments of the country where the provision of electricity is marginally economical at best and, in many cases, uneconomical. However, that is the position with the population and it is important that we make provision in the new arrangement to ensure power is continued to be supplied to them.</P>
    <P>The legislation has significant implications for the concept of regional development in Ireland. We take for granted the availability of power when we step into a room, turn on a switch or plug in a machine and have immediate power. If in a competitive market electricity providers find it is more economical to provide for specific areas and there is no attraction in providing power to sparsely populated regions, something which may well be the case with market forces of supply and demand, I would be concerned that that would militate against the concept of regional development and decentralisation of industry and the population.</P>
    <P>Regarding the mechanics of the new arrangement, in particular the provision of an appeal mechanism and the procedures to be put in place in those circumstances, individuals who put together a proposal and submit it to the commission for consideration only to become disappointed will naturally want to know why it was rejected, especially if they have spent a considerable amount of money putting the plan together and testing its viability in advance. If plans are <Col N="1245" /> submitted to the commission and they are refused for some reason, it is important that by way of the appeals procedure or whatever mechanism is in place for disappointed applicants the plans are reviewed in a meaningful way. If the recommendations of the review are that the plan should have been accepted in the first place, what obligation would there be on the commission in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Another factor is small third parties who find they have a renewable energy source. What provision will there be for them if they want to feed into the national grid? There are examples of people being involved in hydro or wind power linking into the national grid, and their bargaining position is very limited. It is important, if the concept of renewable energy is to be encouraged, that their bargaining position in that context be examined and some safeguards built in, if necessary.</P>
    <P>We should welcome the Bill, which gives effect to an EU directive. The EU has directed that there must be liberalisation in certain areas and this is the most recent area affected by such directives. It is good to see this happening because it will lead to a reduction, or will help cap the overall increase, in electricity charges, which are significant for substantial users. Large users of electricity will have a bargaining power with providers, be they the ESB or other independent providers in the business of generating and providing electricity. I am always afraid in such circumstances that those whose need for electricity is less than the larger users may lose out because their ability to negotiate in an open market will be limited. I do not know if it is possible to deal with this under public service obligations or in an open market, but it may well be necessary to examine it and build in some safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her speech dealt briefly with the early days of the development of hydroelectricity in Ardnacrusha when people of enterprise developed what was a modern concept for the time. Given the considerable mileage of rivers I wonder why there has not been more development in the hydro area. It may be that the speed and flow of water is not sufficient or that there are not suitable sites. Some years ago the ESB carried out a survey of hydro sites. It appears there has been a limited identification of potential sites. When rivers are in full flow in the wintertime this is an area that could be revisited with some profit. From an environmental point of view, there is no more satisfactory way of generating electricity than through the hydro system. The initial capital investment in such plants is a major undertaking but the subsequent running costs are relatively low and more environmentally attractive than some of the ways of fuelling other generating stations.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill. It is worthwhile and will have far reaching consequences for the economy. I hope it will lead to reduced costs of electricity and will play its part in ensuring the momentum of industrial <Col N="1246" /> development continues. It is important that the end-of-the-day arrangement will not have any discouraging effect on regional development. I have no doubt all these areas were considered before the Bill was introduced. It will make a significant contribution to the well being of the economy in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>A few years ago I took my children to visit it. This is a very interesting historical exercise. It traces the history of emigration between northern Ulster and North America in particular from the 17th century up to comparatively recently. As you walk around you will see the houses they left and the houses they went to on reaching the New World. I began to look at such things as old oil lamps, tilly lamps, the open hearth and the cooking utensils. I remembered such things in my own house and in the houses of my neighbours. One of my daughters, facetious as always, said she knew I was old but did not think I was ancient. I explained to her that electricity, and particularly the provision of rural electricity, created a revolution. In many respects it was a greater revolution than the more recent revolutions that the young people in the Gallery will be aware of, such as the communications explosion. Electricity revolutionised rural life. For many centuries things had not changed. The lamps which many Members remember from their youth had been the same for generations. The availability of electricity in nearly all our houses created not only changes in lifestyle but changes in attitude. The changes, North and South, in the past 20 or so years, owe much to electricity and the fact that it made television possible. We were told on television that we did not have sex in Ireland before television. It made other changes as well. Given that television was an alternative, I wonder why it should have had this effect in relation to the subject I have mentioned but on which I will not elaborate. It revolutionised the country and the attitudes of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> I pay tribute, as many others have done, to the ESB for what it has achieved over the years, particularly in relation to rural electrification. As one who looked at it from outside, we in the North were envious of what the ESB had achieved. In 1961 we got the electricity at home. This was only 40 miles from Belfast and between reasonable towns and only half a mile from the main road. In my forays over the Border and into your constituency, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and particularly to Donegal we were envious that there seemed to be electricity everywhere. That the ESB has received much consultancy work in Africa and all over the world indicates that its work has been recognised internationally.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the ESB for the work it did at Christmas in the most severe weather conditions. It is worth reminding ourselves that it is only in the worst weather conditions that those men have to go out and do the work they did at Christmas. I draw a comparison between the ESB and what it did and the criticism directed at its Northern colleagues, well deserved in many instances, not of the workmen but of the management.</P>
    <P>Our principal spokesperson, Deputy Yates, has outlined the Fine Gael attitude to the Bill. I do not propose to repeat it. We support the Bill but with reservations which will be expressed more fully in our amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister apologised for her temporary absence because of a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I did not think the apology was necessary because I understood her position and that she had expected the timetable would have been different. It is important for the Minister to be in this House. It is also important that the Minister be available to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Presumably those discussions on North-South matters were sufficiently important for the Minister to absent herself. It occurred to me that if the meeting with the Secretary of State was so important and the subjects being discussed were so important, why was there not a single reference to co-operation on energy matters, North and South, in her speech?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we were discussing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>And rightly so. The fact that the Minister was discussing it shows how important and essential it is. However, there was no reference in the Minister's speech to that matter, which the Minister has admitted was sufficiently important for her to absent herself from the House. In terms of what is happening between North and South in the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement, the bodies North and South and the new responsibilities which Ministers now have in relation to Northern Ireland, it seems strange that there is no reference in the Minister's speech to that important meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> I hope the deficiency was remedied at the meeting. I hope the Minister had a fruitful meeting and that she and Secretary of State Mowlam discussed these matters in-depth and agreed on implementation. I look forward to a report from the Minister and I will facilitate her in making a report to this House. If she has not given one before she next answers questions in the House, I will ensure that it will be a priority question. Perhaps I will get an opportunity to raise the issue before that.</P>
    <P>There were always major advantages in cross-Border co-operation in energy matters and I and others have made many speeches on that subject over the years, but since the British-Irish Agreement the argument is unanswerable. We require an agreed energy policy for the island. I hope that was the subject of the Minister's meeting with the Secretary of State today. A common energy policy for the island should be recognised in this or other legislation. Provision should be made, for example, for a single regulatory authority for the island. There is a regulatory authority in Northern Ireland. I am lucky enough to know Mr. Douglas McIldoon who is responsible for implementing it. He and I were students together. He is doing a good job in the North. A single regulatory authority for the island is what we ought to be aiming for, maybe not immediately, although I would like it immediately, but down the road. There should not be one in the North and another in the South; there should be one for the island. I hope the Minister is working in that direction.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between North and South will be a challenge. There was difficulty in this respect in the discussions which took place at Stormont. There were proposals on energy co-operation North and South which were jettisoned in the last day or so of the discussions. It is of mutual interest to everybody, North and South, that these matters be reintroduced at some stage. I think that will happen because many of them are practical matters. They will return to the agenda and the quicker it happens, the better.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for this legislation is to increase or, as some might say, introduce competition. Competition between North and South will be a challenge also. The Northern Ireland electricity service is currently looking for a site for a power station on this part of the island and that will create a challenge for the ESB which is welcome. The chief executive of NIE, Dr. Patrick Haren, stated that the ESB would have to invest £1 billion over the next five years and this would force it to raise prices. He said that NIE would need to offer a price reduction of 5 per cent to large companies in the Republic for them to switch to NIE, and that is his company's plan.</P>

NIE will have <Col N="1249" /> to pay the ESB for use of its distribution system and the company is waiting to see the cost of this when the market is fully liberalised. I am not sure that this Bill will give it much help in deciding what would be its bid.</P>

      <P>There are some other matters which I want to raise briefly in the limited time available to me. I like to listen to the Sinn Féin Deputy, Deputy Ó Caoláin, who, together with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, represents Cavan-Monaghan, talking about North-South co-operation. I am sorry he did not contribute to this debate. I have always wanted to know how the blowing up of the electricity connector between North and South contributed to forwarding unity on the island. I have always wanted to ask a member of that party that question face to face in the hope that they would not be able to dodge the answer. I am glad that nonsense has stopped.</P>
      <P>Our increasing dependence on gas seems to be a matter of some security concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned not only in the context of this island, I am concerned about the gas supplies from Russia because, as I understand it, much of the gas being imported to Britain, Scotland and Ireland comes from the Ukraine. I cast my mind back to what happened in 1973 and the extent to which we were dependent on oil supplies from the Middle East. This was first brought to my attention by a paper I read in which some considerable concern was expressed about the security aspects, particularly in circumstances where our gas reserves at Kinsale are about to expire. If we are to be totally dependent on imported gas through Scotland, we ought to give some consideration to the security aspects. Maybe we will discover gas off County Mayo. We live in hope of that and I look forward to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share in the criticism which was voiced by Deputy Sargent and others of the progress being made in the provision of alternative energy. We are not doing enough, particularly in the case of wind energy. There are problems in that regard. People do not want masts etc., but if there is a form of energy to which we ought to pay attention, it is wind energy. It is a dereliction of duty <Col N="1250" /> and irresponsible that we have not done more. Greater emphasis should be placed on this area.</P>
    <P>The independence of the commission on the one hand and accountability to the House on the other has been raised. That is a source of concern. The Minister informed us that there will be accountability to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the joint Oireachtas committee, of which I am a member. Certain public service obligations have been specified. The proper balance has to be struck. We know from experience in the telecommunications area that this is a sensitive matter.</P>

Other parliamentary democracies have encountered this problem but they have found ways to deal with it. I hope we will do the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Currie for raising the issue of North-South co-operation, particularly in terms of electricity generation and the sharing of infrastructure. The peace process has resulted in the reopening of the interconnector between North and South. The provision of a North-South electricity link would be of huge symbolic importance, as was the reopening of the Lough Erne-Ballyconnell Canal. It would also make economic sense. Once the regulators are in place they should commence discussions on the issue. The Minister should discuss the matter with her opposite number.</P>
      <P>Prior to being elected I worked as an executive with Esat Digifone and I have been retained as an adviser. Previously I worked as a broadcaster in the commercial broadcasting sector. The great age of monopolies, be they in the banking, utilities or public sector, is at an end. Despite this, because of its size, the ESB has a major role to play in what is a small market. The question is whether the market is of sufficient size to be an ideal candidate for full deregulation. Deregulation in the telecommunications sector has been spectacularly successful. There has been downward pressure on the fixed line prices charged by Telecom Éireann. This is an indication that competition benefits ordinary consumers and industry and makes the economy more competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are painfully aware from the difficult negotiations in Brussels that Structural Funds are running out. It is imperative, therefore, that we get the fundamentals right in terms of electricity generation and telecommunications infrastructure to maintain a competitive edge. Electricity and tele<Col N="1251" /> communications services ought to be regarded as commodities. A significant statistic is that we export more <i>per capita </i>than Japan. To remain competitive we must reduce costs well below those of our competitors which service large domestic markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reassure the staff of the ESB that they will not be placed at a disadvantage following the introduction of competition. Competition opens up a new vista for companies subjected to it. This is a good Bill in the sense that we are not running ahead of ourselves in terms of our obligations under the EU directives, although there was a case for doing so in the telecommunications sector. The matter can be reviewed at the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>It is my experience that the ESB is one of our best run State companies. It has a proud record and a good relationship with its customers. From time to time members of staff will carp that new competitors are being allowed to cherry-pick the heavy users of electricity. That is true but the ESB has developed a successful consultancy division which is able to compete for sizeable and lucrative contracts abroad. It is a company with international trading experience which can compete in the global market and which has already done so. It is also a company which has served the country well by rolling out major infrastructure. One could argue that the ESB is the only really big company Ireland has produced which has provided major infrastructure, has a large domestic customer base and has remained profitable.</P>
    <P>In its early years the company was run by engineers which was a source of tension within the company. I suspect that as competition arrives on the doorstep of the ESB, the company will be forced more and more to look not just at the engineering issues which bring it into the marketplace but also at the marketing skills which are necessary to sell the product both to the big users and to ordinary consumers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can give us some reassurance that the 28 or 32 per cent of top users will not be the only ones to benefit from the downward pressure on price. The downward pressure will obviously be experienced by corporate, large volume users but I would like some reassurance that the ordinary consumer will also see the benefits. This is a difficult issue to regulate or influence. In the past we have seen that a danger of limited deregulation is the creation of a cosy duopoly. We need to build in some protection for the ordinary customer.</P>
    <P>Some earlier speakers referred to the danger of overloading our electrical infrastructure because of our booming economy. This is not unlike the situation confronting the Minister in relation to traffic and road use. Our infrastructure is fully stretched. ESB staff will attest to that. We may be heading into a relatively dangerous situation where even though the company is working at full throttle, blackouts are frequently experienced. In <Col N="1252" /> my own area of Newcastle, County Dublin, we have experienced occasional electricity blackouts.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to look at this problem in terms of expansion of the ESB network. The problem is not the fault of the Minister or the ESB. The best economists, demographers and statisticians could not have foretold the enormous economic success and growth that has been achieved. No one planned for it but it is now time to plan how we are going to solve this problem because the system is at overload. Investment is needed in order to upgrade the service and one hopes the arrival of private operators will lead to greater investment and the expansion of capacity. All statistics point to the fact that our population is growing and that the State will have a population of approximately five million by 2026. This is a huge challenge for electricity and for our infrastructure generally.</P>
    <P>The creation of the Department of Public Enterprise by the Government was very timely. The clustering of these areas of State and semi-State activity under the same Ministry is very appropriate. Similar issues arise in the areas of aviation, telecommunications, electricity generation and so on. I congratulate the Minister and the Taoiseach for the leadership they are showing not only in relation to electricity but also in relation to harnessing the benefits which will come from the Internet and from electronic commerce. That area is also of huge importance and is not unrelated to the area of electricity in that the basic product which drives much economic activity will depend on our electricity infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the staff of the ESB for their performance during the Christmas period. I congratulate the company and its staff for the wonderful work they have done to date and which I am sure they will continue to do in the future. The ESB is a great Irish company and I know it will not only survive the winds of competition but will thrive, precisely because the company has been given a five or six year period in which to tool-up for a fresh wave of liberalisation and competition. We must deal with this matter gently. There is no point rushing our fences in relation to electricity generation. The ESB is one of those Irish companies which can withstand the challenge of competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on important legislation. I do so from a midlands perspective as the Minister is very much aware. Peat-fired electricity generation is very important in our part of the country and in the overall economy. This is the most important legislation brought before the House this year and it will affect the economy for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the ESB workers who, over the years, have built up the company to its present level of success. People often quibble about public sector workers but we see their value both in their expertise and in their readiness to respond <Col N="1253" /> to crises, often in hazardous conditions, as they did during the past two Christmas periods. We should appreciate them for their work in extremely hazardous conditions to ensure that we enjoy comfort in our homes. We must never ignore that and we must approach a Bill such as this with an awareness of what has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The essence of what is proposed is that the Government will open the Electricity Supply Board, which up to now has solely controlled the generation and distribution of electricity, to free market forces. In carrying out its task the ESB has been a major force for economic and social development both nationally and regionally.</P>
    <P>It is important that we remind ourselves of the role the Government has played in the past in regulating and deciding policy in the electricity industry. It must now put in place a structure that will serve equally well the continuing development of the country both economically and socially.</P>
    <P>We are a member of the European club and, under this directive, we must accept that our markets for all services, commodities and products are open to be supplied by other players in European industry. We must contribute to sharing the burden of coping with greenhouse gas emissions in the same way as other countries. We must preserve our interests at national and regional level despite the desire of Brussels to impose conditions or directives which cut across the foundations of our current economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this Bill is to establish a select group, be it a small commission or single individual, to act as a regulator, a king over the fundamental lifeblood of industrial and social progress, that is the electricity supply. I see this, in the first place, as an enormous ceding of the power and role of the Government. I can offer the responsible Minister in future a comfortable hiding place when things go wrong. Like the Attorney General, I have asked the question, who regulates the regulators? That is a very important question. This House has given up much power and in relation to the principles of democracy and political accountability it is important that such people be answerable to this House and to the Minister. In this way the public demand for accountability is satisfied. I agree with the view echoed by the Attorney General in UCD in November 1998. It was a pertinent debate held by the UCD law society and one to which we should devote more time and consideration. It was extremely pertinent to this legislation. I hope its passage through the House will be slow and that some of the worthwhile amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage will be accepted.</P>
    <P>The fundamentals of the electricity industry and its impact on the national economy are centred on three issues: do we have control over primary energy supply for electricity; do we have national policy on the diversity of primary energy supply; and do we have policy on indigenous sources of primary energy or on our ability to generate our electricity from our own resources. <Col N="1254" /> I conclude from my reading of this Bill that the answer to these questions is no. This important Bill does not address any of these issues. The danger is that we could become a subservient economy where our worst fears could be realised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg referred to some of those earlier. A small group or individual, while well meaning, might be unable or unwilling to take account of the wider social and economic driving forces here. Their primary influence would be short-term expediency which appeases various pressure groups, such as industrialists who will get their way. Deputy Conor Lenihan made an important point about who will be the major beneficiaries of the cheap electricity that will come on stream? Will the benefit be held at a certain level or will it permeate down to consumers in rural areas? That is an important question. The primary influence of such people will also appease the Brussels command centre. A fundamental flaw of this proposed legislation is that it does not impose a duty on the regulatory body to take into account such issues of national interest and self-reliance. Sometimes I am under the impression that successive Governments have lost their ability to assert themselves in many areas that are dominated by Brussels. I hold that view and held it when my party was in Government.</P>

      <P>We should not have to be forever trying to balance the equation of money in terms of money or sovereignty lost. Our history merits us a different equation. Apart from that, we must deal with some imminent realities. By 2006, on the assumption that the demand for electricity grows at 4 per cent per annum, and some commentators say that percentage is conservative&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated it will grow at 6 per cent per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a 50 per cent increase on the rate I predicted. Based on a growth in <Col N="1255" /> demand of 4 per cent per annum, by 2006 Ireland will import more than 90 per cent of the fuels needed for electricity generation. By then, Ireland's dependency on external energy resources will be the second highest of the 15 EU member states, second only to Portugal. If the Minister's figure of 6 per cent is correct, and I have no reason to doubt her, Ireland could be the most dependent EU member state on external fuels required to generate electricity.</P>
      <P>The likelihood is that the major developments in electricity generation will be from imported natural gas as Ireland's known gas resources will be exhausted in three years' time. We will be highly dependent on imported natural gas. Our dependency on imported gas and oil-fired generation will reach about 70 per cent of the total capacity and will put the country in a more strategically vulnerable position than it was at the time of the first oil crisis in the early 1970s.</P>
      <P>My interest is to protect our indigenous sources of raw materials for the generation of electricity. Peat-fired electricity generation has made a social and economic contribution to our economy, particularly to the economy of the midlands. It has generated direct employment and ancillary activities in rural areas. Once constructed for gas or oil, these plants cannot be converted to use another fuel type in circumstances of an interruption in supply. Ireland's economic lifeline will be literally a series of interconnected pipelines spreading under water into Europe and across to the Middle East, north Africa and Russia. While there seems little choice in this unless there is a major natural gas find, it is imperative that the country maintains as much supply of indigenous energy within reasonable costs to limit the disastrous effects of a failure in the supply lines for whatever reason. It may result from technical or human failure or political instability as a result of which our economy could be crippled. For this reason the policies of past Governments in support of an indigenous energy industry is of even greater importance today.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about converting peat to electricity and she and my colleague, Deputy Stagg, have played a role in bringing that about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We should each know where the other is going because we share the same constituency. Technology for converting peat to electricity has been developed over the past ten to 15 years to the extent that new power plants are generating 37 per cent more electricity from one tonne of peat than those installed in the ESB system. The effect of this was seen when the <Col N="1256" /> Europeat Generation Competition was won by the IVO at 3.5p per kilowatt. This amounts to about 1p extra or 12.5 per cent on the domestic electricity tariff compared with the cheapest which would be a combined cycle gas-fired generating plant.</P>
      <P>Under the EU Electricity Directive 96/92 EC, Ireland is permitted to use peat for 15 per cent of the fuel needed for electricity generation. That was the clear understanding we had when we agreed to open up the market for electricity. That is a critical point. Even when the Europeat station, which will generate 120 megawatts of electricity, is fully operational &ndash; there may be some closures of small stations &ndash; Ireland can use an additional 800,000 tonnes of peat per year for electricity generation and still comply with the terms of this directive. That is important. In the Minister's Department there may be people who may not want to push peat-fired generation stations.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the Minister will be found wanting, but I back her on this and give her moral support because it is important that those people's views should be placed in context. We should not be found wanting because we are permitted to use peat for 15 per cent of the fuel needed for electricity generation. We can also use an additional 800,000 tonnes of peat per year and there is plenty of peat in the midlands.</P>
      <P>Many will put forward the argument about CO2 emissions and Ireland's problems in complying with the target set for the country to limit its CO2 emission levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent reports suggest that a solution could be found by converting all electricity to gas and effectively closing down ESB powered stations and Bord na Móna. Those who put forward that solution are ivory tower economists living in cuckooland. If we were to follow that route, the economy of the midlands would be closed down. The warning from the midlands is that nobody had better contemplate going down that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cause of Ireland's CO2 emissions has been due to the economic boom we are enjoying. We all fight our corner as best we can, but much of these emissions are generated on the east coast. The midlands is seeking to attract more industrial investment and we are trying to play a part in securing that. It would be ironic if the people of the midlands were deprived of one of the greatest industries that has sustained them there for 40 years and which can continue to play an important national role for another 25 years. I accept that the CO2 issue must be addressed. However, I am critical of the manner in which targets were agreed for Ireland. We now find we <Col N="1257" /> have to shoehorn the solution into the economy of the midlands. I am aware that improved technology and the potential of the bogs to grow forestry and lock carbon emissions provide peat with a good ticket to continue to supply electricity from the limited remaining resources.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss some aspects of the Bill in the light of this perspective, while at the same time dealing with some of the issues which need Government commitment. I will deal with the duty and role of the regulator, in regard to the promotion of indigenous primary energy, which very soon will be limited to our peat and bog resources.</P>
    <P>The Government seems to have set itself a limited retrenchment policy in the use of these resources. This is a most disappointing aspect of energy and regional development policy. When natural gas is finished in 2002, the only indigenous resource we will have is peat. There are about 120 million tonnes of industrial peat available throughout the midlands, which is not an insignificant amount.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna owns about 12,000 acres of bogs, evenly divided into two groups in Westmeath. The Minister is extremely aware of this proposal and I am sure she will make an all-out effort to get it included in the national plan. One group is centred in north Westmeath in the area of Coole. The second area is near Ballivor and Ratharney, on the Westmeath-Meath border. There are sufficient peat reserves there, amounting to 14 million tonnes, which can supply a 60 megawatt peat-fired power station for 25 years, at a consumption rate of half a tonne per annum. In addition, the area can supply horticultural peat from some of these bogs which have suitable material for that use. All these bogs have been previously worked for sod turf and horticultural peat and are not areas designated as having any conservation status.</P>
    <P>Unless an integrated plan for the use of these bogs is drawn up and implemented, this resource will lie wasted and a major industrial opportunity will be lost in the region. This proposal is backed 100 per cent by Bord na Móna and Westmeath County Council. The Minister is also extremely familiar with the proposal and she is committed to the utilisation of our peat resources. I would support 100 per cent, as would our spokesperson, Deputy Stagg, the bringing forward of a plan for this area, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The areas in question are in the midlands region, which the Government acknowledges merits Objective One status in the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds for Ireland. There is a compelling case for this project to be included in Ireland's programme for EU assistance in the development of the region.</P>
    <P>In common with the Minister, I represent a rural constituency in a region which, as a whole, has 66 per cent of average <i>per capita</i> income. There are pockets within this region where this falls below 60 per cent. We all know about drystock farmers' incomes at present. I want the few <Col N="1258" /> opportunities available in this region to explore a natural asset to be fully exploited. The natural resources available in this area can provide 140 permanent and 70 seasonal good quality jobs for 25 years. That area includes Coole, Rathowen, Castlepollard and Ratharney and it would benefit greatly if the Minister ensures this proposal is included in the national plan. It has widespread support in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would also benefit the Deputy and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. However, even if it were not in our area it would be an extremely important proposal.</P>
      <P>In the course of the passage of this Bill I will be seeking to ensure that the duties and functions of the regulator and the commission are clearly and satisfactorily spelled out in regard to a policy for the continued use of all the remaining commercial peat available for power generation. That is extremely important. If we do not do that, as my colleague, Deputy Stagg, spelled out this morning, despite us having a temporary reprieve through the public service obligation, our peat-fired stations could be under threat. That is a consequence of opening up and liberating the electricity generation market.</P>
      <P>However, if we take a positive decision in this Bill to ensure that the duties and functions of the regulator are fully spelled out and the commission is clearly aware of the policy direction in which we want to go in regard to the remaining commercial peat, we can make a contribution which people will say in 20 or 30 years' time was informed by foresight and intelligence.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the speedy way in which she has dealt with this legislation. I urge her to continue with the efficiency with which she is handling the ESB and the other agencies for which she has responsibility. This Bill is a follow-up to the telecommunications and aviation reorganisations she has undertaken and it is very welcome.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment, the ESB has been fundamental in the development of our economy. Over the past 70 years, it has been a very strong engine for economic and social development. The ESB never lost sight of the important social dimension, which is borne out very effectively in the efficient way in which it dealt with the rural electrification scheme over the years and the policies it followed in that regard.</P>
      <P>The ESB staff magazine, <i>The Electric Mail</i>, described this legislation as the beginning of the end and the start of a new beginning. This is the start of a new and exciting beginning for the ESB, and one which will present many challenges and opportunities.</P>
      <P>I was involved with the ESB for 25 years &ndash; I dealt with it in the old ESB fisheries division when I worked for Shannon fisheries before I became a Member of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>While we could ring-fence the ESB fisheries division and what has been taking place in the Shannon fisheries, the ESB has been innovative and expert in dealing with the development of some of its power stations. The Moneypoint station was a feat of both marine and electricity generating engineering skills. The skill and dedication applied to the building of Moneypoint was an example of what Irish technicians and engineers can achieve. Electricity unit costs in Moneypoint are much lower than the national average. The Minister will be aware that on successive occasions I made representations that the fourth phase of Moneypoint should be completed. This would not only meet some of the electricity demand, it would also provide electricity at a very competitive price.</P>
      <P>The one difficulty concerning the development of the fourth phase at Moneypoint is that emissions from the plant would increase, which might bring them above the level laid down in the guidelines. This can be effectively dealt with by the ESB. It is essential that pollution controlling equipment be installed in the chimneys at Moneypoint. This equipment should have been installed when the station was being constructed, but it was not. The work needs to be undertaken now.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that it will cost some money is relevant but it should not be a reason for the development not to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I have studied this matter carefully and have discussed it with those concerned. It is possible to fit pollution control systems into the chimneys at Moneypoint and that would reduce emissions. New developments have taken place in energy generation and innovative ideas from Finland, Sweden and elsewhere can be applied to Moneypoint whose fourth phase should be completed. This would greatly enhance the ESB's ability to meet demand as well as ensuring that additional electricity would be generated at rock bottom prices. It would be far cheaper than any new proposals that have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In anticipation of the new legislation an application for a new station has already been lodged with Fingal County Council by a company from Northern Ireland and the ESB is planning its own developments. In light of these, it is imperative that the ESB should press ahead with the development of the fourth phase unit at Moneypoint, as I have suggested. The main infrastructural work was put in at the construction stage during the late 1970s and early 1980s. There is no reason this cannot be done in tandem with the <Col N="1260" /> pollution control system. It would certainly meet some of the pressures on electricity generation at present.</P>
    <P>The ESB has been described as a national institution. It has been part and parcel of the country's overall economic development. If the same level of economic development is to continue and accelerate, it is essential to have the most modern system of electricity generation in place to meet demand.</P>
    <P>Some time ago research studies were carried out along the west Clare coastline on electricity generation by wave power. As the Minister is aware, there has been some discussion in the House at Question Time about a current proposal to develop a wave powered station on the west Clare coast, not far from Kilkee. This would fit into the ESB's national grid. A Scottish company put forward that proposal and a contract for the purchase of electricity had been offered by the ESB.</P>
    <P>The ESB should accelerate its research work in that area. The research that has been carried out has clearly indicated opportunities for the generation of substantial units of electricity from wave power along the west coast which is ideally suited to this type of activity. It is essential for the ESB, the new commission and the regulator to identify areas where it will be possible to generate electricity from wave power and to feed it into the national grid. It is important to examine such natural resource areas that, while available, are not being developed or exploited. With some innovation and investment they could provide a lucrative opportunity. I urge the ESB to undertake such research.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record our appreciation of the magnificent achievement of the ordinary rank and file staff in the ESB who have gone out in all weather conditions to maintain the electricity supply. We saw that during the winter when ESB personnel carried out repair work in appalling conditions to maintain supplies, especially in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan mentioned the concerns in the agricultural community about the lack of continuity of supply in some rural areas. I want to acknowledge that there has been heavy investment by the ESB. Nevertheless, there has been criticism of that investment in improving new transformers and lines because there have been successive breakdowns in particular areas. There has been criticism that, to some extent, the new system which has been funded and put in place is not adequate to meet current demand.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert in that area, but over the years we did not have a mechanism or facility for raising individual issues or problems such as those. On numerous occasions I endeavoured to ask parliamentary questions about the day to day activities of the ESB, but was prohibited from doing so because of the legislation in place. We need to change that in the new regulations and we want to be in such a position when the new legislation is finally completed. I appreciate that <Col N="1261" /> this is part of a tripartite legislative proposal by the Minister, which may all be put into one Bill. Nevertheless, whatever new arrangements are put in place, we want to be in a position to raise issues in the House which are of importance to our constituents. We do not want to be ruled out of order because they are matters for the regulator, the commission or some individual to whom we cannot have access. In the formulation and tidying up of the legislation I will support some mechanism whereby individual problems that may arise and which are brought to our attention can be raised by Members in the House.</P>
    <P>I intervened in the debate first to compliment the Minister on the way in which she has dealt with this process and has speeded it up. Second, I intervened to urge the ESB to go ahead with the fourth phase at Moneypoint and not to be deterred by problems with pollution control which can be dealt with anyway, as they must be. Even if the fourth phase of Moneypoint was never developed the ESB should install the necessary equipment to deal with pollution control.</P>
    <P>I compliment especially the many people with ESB International for the work they are doing on overseas projects. For a short period I was Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid. I saw at first hand the invaluable work that was being done in underdeveloped countries by ESB personnel who provided essential water supplies through the generation of electricity. They applied their expertise to solve problems for the poorest people in Tanzania and other African countries. These people are to be complimented. Many of them have returned home and are involved in consultancy work. They have recognised that innovative changes are taking place in the generation and transmission of electricity and they are anxious that such changes should be applied here at home to make the service more efficient and less expensive. This approach will generally help to deliver a better service throughout the country, both for industry and private consumers.</P>
    <P>Given the new changes that will come about it is essential that care be taken to ensure that, in the transition period from the old arrangements to the new ones, conditions of employment and other matters are dealt with. These matters can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, I hope that before the debate on the Bill concludes the ESB will indicate the position regarding the important and valuable Shannon fisheries under the new regulations. These fisheries have not been fully developed or utilised. The unique eel fishery on the Shannon is underdeveloped in comparison to the position in Lough Neagh. It is in the shade in terms of what can be done through the proper utilisation of a valuable national resource. I hope there will be an indication of how these matters will be dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, loose ends were created during the reorganisation of Departments and admin<Col N="1262" /> istration in the past. This caused problems later and it is important that issues such as the eel and Shannon fisheries and other social matters handled by the ESB in the past are addressed under this important Bill. An indication of how these matters will be dealt with under the new regime is necessary. I welcome this great Bill and I compliment the Minister on introducing it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it. The Bill is an important step along the way for the ESB. The members of the Government who introduced the Electricity Supply Act in 1927 were men of vision. They saw the need for electricity and they went about introducing it. The main driving force at the time was the late Minister for Industry and Commerce, Paddy McGilligan. Enormous credit is due to him, the then Government and all those associated with that Act and developments which took place subsequently for their foresight.</P>
      <P>The ESB is an excellent firm. Regarding its record in the recent past, the company had profits after tax in 1997 of £160 million. It is generally believed that its profits for 1998 will be in excess of £200 million. This is a sizeable amount of money and I will deal later with how it should be spent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the intention of which is to restructure the main components of the energy industry in Ireland. The Bill proposes that the regulator will take over the role previously held by the Minister, her Department and the ESB. It will also impact heavily on Bord na Móna. Therefore, it is important, given that these major powers are about to be vested in one office or individual, that all the implications for the national energy policy are considered.</P>
      <P>Up to now the role the ESB and Bord na Móna played in providing the necessary electricity requirements for Ireland and the regional development associated with Bord na Móna's and the ESB's activities have been the cause of the success of regional economic development. They have been of major importance, particularly in the midlands and the west. My constituency and neighbouring counties have all benefited considerably. They were a major boost to the economy of the midlands and the constituency I represent. While there have been job losses in the area, I hope that in the future the ESB and Bord na Móna will consider how they can develop other ancillary industries and help to provide alternative employment. I am sure the Minister agrees. They have also been a great factor in economic development at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the degree to which Ireland is dependent on energy from imported sources. This matter is of concern and the point has even <Col N="1263" /> greater significance because, as an island nation, we are dependent on imports. Although Ireland is a member of the European Union, a properly developed mechanism whereby the energy resources and systems which operate in Europe can be evenly and adequately shared by Ireland does not exist. The high level of dependency on imports of primary energy, which will be even greater in the next five or six years, frightens me.</P>
    <P>My information is that Ireland will depend on sources outside the European Union for over 90 per cent of its primary energy. Ireland is the most dependent country in the EU in terms of its level of energy imports. Consequently, in the context of the Bill I want to ensure that the Minister takes full account and makes provision for the maximum use of indigenous energy resources.</P>
    <P>Our gas reserves are being rapidly depleted and we are dependent for supply on two major aspects associated with gas. Much of the gas we use is from the North Sea and Norway, which is stable at present. However, in six or seven years, many of these resources will be considerably depleted and we will be heavily reliant on Russia, the Middle East, Algeria and other such countries which are highly unstable. They are high risk sources. The gas we will use will come from sources outside the European Union. Some of these areas are politically and economically unstable and that is likely to remain the case.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of our gas supplies with which I am uncomfortable is that Ireland is equally dependent on transport systems which are outside our control. We depend on the British transmission system and there is only one interconnecting pipeline. If Ireland's current economic growth continues, we will be dependent on gas for over 60 per cent of our primary energy by 2010, 11 years from now. Our other primary sources of energy will be oil and coal, all of which is currently imported. This will also be the case in the future. Our only major indigenous source of energy is peat. It is essential to assist Bord na Móna in every way possible in the maximum and most efficient use of peat. Finland is the only other European country which uses a similar amount of peat.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is the regulation of the electricity industry and all associated aspects. My biggest concern is that the Bill does not provide sufficient support for the future of the peat industry. In terms of the role set out for the regulator, the directions on how this valuable national asset should be used in the future are totally inadequate. My fear is that the peat industry and the portion of the electricity industry which depends on peat is not provided for in the functions and duties of the regulator. I ask the Minister to address this aspect on later Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Aside from the simple economics of electricity generation based on different types of fuel, the regulator should take account of the broader issues regarding dependency on external sources of energy and the regional, economic and social <Col N="1264" /> impact which the peat industry has on the midlands and the west. The Bill should make specific provision in regard to the role of the regulator on this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the construction of the new modern peat-fired power station at Clonbullogue in County Offaly at a cost of over £100 million. I am pleased that the European Union is contributing £21 million to the cost. This power station will demonstrate what the application of high technology and commitment by the workforce of Bord na Móna can do to keep the cost of peat fired electricity generation at an acceptable level compared to other fuels. It also has the benefit of reducing the amount of gas emissions for each unit of electricity generated. The remaining resources in the midlands could support another electricity generation plant using similar technology.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the regulator is obliged, as part of his or her function, to ensure that peat is utilised in the future by the best technology available. There should also be a strong provision in the Bill where the Minister of the day will be compelled to intervene to ensure that such a policy of peat utilisation is implemented. I am not satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill as it stands. The Bill should reflect our capacity to determine our own policy in areas of strategic importance such as energy and electricity generation.</P>
    <P>I want to address the situation in regard to Ferbane power station. I would like the Minister to state clearly and unequivocally that the refurbishment of the station will proceed. I believe the level of worker participation is satisfactory there and hope the ESB will seek to allow contracts to go to tender in February or March. I would also like the Minister and the regulator to ensure that while work is proceeding on unit 4 in Ferbane, units 1 and 2 will remain open. That is essential. Similarly, the units in Rhode and Shannonbridge power stations should also remain open.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that the ESB has made profits in excess of £200 million this year. I would like to see some of that money spent on power stations in which employees are working in unsatisfactory conditions. The stations should be upgraded. Mr. Ken O'Hara has stated that there is a danger of power cuts unless the ESB receives sanction to proceed with building a new power station. I would welcome the development of a new station but I hope that the existing stations are improved.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Daly on a point he made in regard to Moneypoint. I am unhappy with the level of pollution control at the station. There is a need to install cleaners for the chimneys in the station. I urge the Minister to take my comments in regard to Ferbane, Rhode and Shannonbridge into account, even though the stations are not specifically referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Competition is good; we have seen it in the telecommunications <Col N="1265" /> industry in which it seems to be working well. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for a regulatory framework for the introduction of competition in the generation and supply of electricity. An independent commission is to be established to license and regulate the generation and supply of electricity and authorise the construction of new generating plants.</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed to express some concern in her speech yesterday about the role of the Oireachtas and elected representatives in regulating the regulators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that. It is important that we do not give all our power away to these people. I am not casting aspersions on such boards which, in the main, do good work. Some authorities are totally independent of the Oireachtas. Some of us, in our role as elected representatives, write letters to these boards but often do not receive a reply. That is not good enough. I would welcome the Minister's introduction of a certain amount of accountability into the process.</P>
      <P>Demand for electricity has increased by 6 per cent per annum in recent years. This has led to a problem in the Cobh area which I represent. The Minister is already familiar with the problem which relates to electricity pylons. I am aware of people who are physically sick and under their doctors' care as a result of worrying about this issue. The ESB wants to construct yet another set of pylons &ndash; of which there are already seven &ndash; across the island.</P>
      <P>The impending enactment of this legislation changes everything. The Minister officiated at the opening of the new Guinness power station and was fulsome in her praise of the savings which would accrue as a result of its opening. A number of companies in the Cork region are pursuing a similar policy. The line of pylons which the ESB plans to build in Cobh might no longer be necessary if these other companies are considering following the Minister's advice. Many of their plans are well advanced. Perhaps the Minister might ask the ESB to hold off on the construction of these pylons, at least until the independent commission is in place. The regulator and the commission should be given time to examine the overall situation in light of the changed circumstances which this Bill will allow. Quite a number of companies in the Cork region where the power is required are seriously considering the provision of their own heat and power and their plans to do so are well advanced. All sides could save face if this were possible. If the ESB proceeds with the construction of the pylons in Cobh, people will be very upset. Perhaps the Minister could use her good offices to intervene in this matter. The regulator and the commission should examine the situation. The ESB has waited this long &ndash; a few more months should not make a huge difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the issue of safety. Wiring <Col N="1266" /> installations in houses must be examined and certified before connections are put in place. RECI was established some years ago on the advice of the Minister's Department. There is also another organisation which issues certificates in this regard. Many people, including the ESB, are concerned that nobody is supervising the regulators. This Bill provides an opportunity to give the regulator the authority to supervise the other regulatory bodies which are in place and any others which might be established in order to ensure the safety of consumers.</P>
    <P>Section 3(8)(d) refers to the promotion of safety and efficiency in regard to electricity. There seems to be something of a grey area here. In 1996, there were 385 electrical fires, 476 fires occurred as a result of electrical wiring installation and 497 fires as a result of cooking incidents. In total, 1,300 fires occurred as a result of electrical problems in 1996. One fire is one too many. It is of paramount importance that somebody supervises the regulatory bodies to ensure everything is carried out in the proper manner. I am not alleging that anything wrong is being done at the moment but there is some unease and concern about the situation. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment seems to be of the opinion that this issue is not its concern. The Departments of Public Enterprise and the Environment and Local Government appear to think likewise. Perhaps the Minister would give the issue some consideration. Monopolies can be problematic. Given that the cost of connecting electricity to houses is quite high, has the Minister plans for deregulation in that area so that the consumer can have a choice here also?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this matter. Although the Minister did not mention the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;, this is the first step &ndash; not that I am objecting. She referred to the introduction of competition in the aviation and telecommunications areas. It has been a tremendous success in both areas, particularly in the aviation industry where it has meant that tourism here has multiplied in the past ten or 12 years since the independent airlines came in here. It is gratifiying to see competition, because competition leads to thriving business, and those two sectors proved that.</P>
      <P>Some 28 per cent of the electricity sector must be open to competition by February 2000 &ndash; that is the minimum required by the EU &ndash; and 32 per cent of the sector must be open to competition by 2003. This again is a minimum. The Minister referred to the fact that some countries will achieve 100 per cent open competition and privatisation.</P>
      <P>In this country the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; is, for some peculiar reason, a dirty word.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do too, and I am glad the Minister does. Competition is the life of trade. Without it our economy would stagnate.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to know how many alternative sources of electricity generation can be practically brought into operation. The burning of coal, oil, gas and turf leads to the emission of carbon gases into the atmosphere, resulting in the depletion of the ozone layer. Such depletion means that we are automatically exposed to much more radiation from the sun, which we did not have to endure years ago. Depletion of the ozone layer is extraordinarily serious. Has the Minister definite plans to reduce the amount of carbon gases, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide which is going into the atmosphere? This is produced not just from the exhausts of cars but from power generating stations which use carboniferous fuels. What plans has the Minister to reduce them? As there is a very strong link between radiation and cancerous diseases, it is a very serious matter. I would like to know the Minister's plans in that regard.</P>
      <P>There are alternative sources of generating electricity. Nuclear energy is taboo. I remember when Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Industry and Commerce floated the idea of erecting a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point, County Wexford, he was nearly run out of the country. The advent of Sellafield created a huge scare here where nuclear power is concerned, so that is not an alternative. The real alternatives are hydro-electric schemes, which are limited because the country is not that mountainous, and wind power. Solar energy does not enter the equation &ndash; a few people tried to use solar energy for summer houses but it was a disaster, so we can forget about it. Wave power is another likely source. There is quite a bit of work to be done on that, but it would be a viable option in time to come. Wind farms are the immediate option. Perhaps the Minister would give us an estimate of the proportion of electricity that will be produced from viable alternative sources which are acceptable to the public in five to ten years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Department of Public Enterprise done a study of the potential for alternative sources of energy here? The issue of wind farms is one on which people feel very strongly, and there is a need for education about them. The alternative is to continue to burn gas, oil, coal and turf, contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. We cannot retain that option. The sooner we have alternatives the better. I do not know what the Minister's advice in this area is, but it would be good if she and the Minister for Health and Children got together with a team of experts and worked it out because we might be unknowingly promoting cancerous diseases, such as leukaemia. It is all very well to open peat-powered, gas-powered and turf-powered stations, but might we not be injuring people's health and doing much more harm than we are complaining about in regard to Sellafield? We probably are, but we will not admit it, and as far as I know, we are not carrying <Col N="1268" /> out studies to evaluate the situation as we should. We have a responsibility to do that.</P>
    <P>As to alternative sources of energy, I propose to dwell on the matter of wind farms. In my own county there is massive opposition to them. Two sites close to Tramore town were pinpointed by private individuals who wanted to set up a wind farm, generate electricity and sell it off. One was shot down by the planning authority after the county manager initially said he would allow it and then changed his mind, and the other is in abeyance. I cannot blame the local people. The thought of something new and large overshadowing their dwellings or nearby is pretty obnoxious and unwelcome. They would prefer if it were on somebody else's patch. People need to be educated as to whether wind farms generate excessive noise. The wind farm concept has been brought to a point of perfection where it is a real alternative and much of our energy could be generated through their use.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago I went to Cornwall in the south-west of England. It is a very scenic county with a large tourism industry. On the side of the main road I came across two wind farms which I found rather extraordinary. I have driven around Ireland quite a bit over the years and have yet to see a full scale wind farm in operation. When one flies over certain European countries, particularly western Germany, one will see dozens of wind farms on a clear day. It is a similar story in Denmark and I am sure it is the same in Belgium, the Netherlands and France. I would like to see what percentage of their energy needs or electricity generation is being achieved through wind farms. Why are we being so defensive in regard to the generation of electricity by wind? I would like to see a greater public debate on the matter. My gut instinct as to why they are not being successfully proceeded with is that local residents do not want them in their area.</P>
    <P>I would like to see county councils identifying areas which are not of extraordinary scenic beauty but which are capable of catching enough of the flow of air coming in from the Atlantic to generate significant power. If they can do it in Germany we should be able to do it here on a multiple of what is being generated there from wind farms. This winter there was hardly a day when there was not a storm. In the west even in the summer there is hardly a day when there is not a storm. All one has to do is try to play golf in places such as Ballybunion or Lahinch and if one hooks or slices one's shot one may never see the ball again. Therefore, the potential exists because of our very windy climate. I do not think sufficient public relations exercises or research has gone into the matter. We should ask each planning authority in the country to identify suitable sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then people could apply for wind farms in those locations and take their chances with the planning authority. Everybody is entitled to apply and to face objections. The process should be allowed go through the proper channels. No concerted effort is being made to do it in an organised, co-ordinated manner. Rather, the current situation is one of hit and miss. Today somebody told me there is a wind farm in the general area of Carrick-on-Suir. I have not seen it &ndash; perhaps it is only being proposed. How many wind farms are there in the country and what is the potential in this area?</P>
      <P>We will be very remiss if we stay with the generating methods which have proved to be very, very dangerous. I am surprised more research has not been carried out. We are always inclined to blame somebody else. We blame the British for Sellafield and its other nuclear installations. If there is a leak at such an installation on the far side of Scotland we kick up about it. We are probably doing much more damage and I would like to see some experts tell us the truth.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention another source of dangerous omissions which I do not think is mentioned often enough. I do not like to see telecommunications masts on hillsides as they affect the visual amenity. The one outside Dungarvan is a monstrosity which should never have been given planning permission. However, while I am not expert in physics, those antenna or masts pose no radiation hazard. There is a much greater hazard posed by sitting in front of the television&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or maybe from a mobile phone. Somebody told me it is possible to fry an egg between two mobile phones. Some of these things give off extraordinary radiation and people seem to be indifferent to them. One can feel the radiation from a television when one sits close to it.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt there is a real and major health risk from the electro-magnetic fields which are created in the vicinity of high tension power wires and I am surprised people do not more strongly object to them rather than to the antennae, the danger from which is negligible. I am not here to chide the Minister or to be awkward, but her officials should be in consultation with the experts in the Department of Health and Children to determine the dangers I referred to in the context of the ozone layer and electro-magnetic fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions with the ESB and other interested parties the Minister should be able to tell us the potential for the alternatives I have mentioned. None of us likes to admit we can remember a time prior to the rural electrification scheme. I admit it, but I know others would not do so too freely. I remember when the scheme started in my area in 1947. Prior to that we were dependent on Aladdin and tilly lamps. Here and there the fortunate person had a wind charger <Col N="1270" /> which used wind power, so the wind farm is only an elaboration of that concept. We have come a long way since.</P>
    <P>I have made a few pertinent points. I do not expect the Minister to have answers here and now, but I would appreciate if she would examine what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am totally opposed to the Bill which uses the word &ldquo;competition&rdquo; in regard to one third of the production and supply of electricity by 2002. Of course there can be no question but that competition is a code word for the beginning of privatisation. However, it is very fashionable for Governments and various interest groups not to use the straight word but rather words which in reality cover the intention. There is no question but that privatisation of the ESB is the end product of this Bill. This is becoming the norm in terms of Government policies. The Government has already privatised TEAM Aer Lingus, which was sold to a multinational company, and it is well on the way to dealing with Telecom Éireann. In this the Government is being supported by the main Opposition party while the Labour Party does not know where it stands &ndash; sometimes it is opposed to the process and other times it is not. It is a total U-turn in comparison to the position taken in the past by the Labour Party in particular, but also by Fianna Fáil, which at least in words stated its complete opposition to privatisation.</P>
      <P>What is envisaged is a betrayal of the people and the ESB in terms of its staff, tradition and history. How was our tremendous electricity generating system established? It was not the publicans and gombeen men who dominated our society in the 1920s and 1930s who got risk capital and ventured it on risky schemes to build the electricity generating capacity, but rather the State in the name of the people and using the resources generated by the people. The State provided the capacity to generate electricity and was responsible for what was, by any standards, a huge achievement in terms of the necessary infrastructure and the huge input which was demanded at that time.</P>
      <P>What we have now is a proposal which will see up to one third of that generating capacity sold off to private concerns. No doubt multinational companies will feature along with the home grown variety. That, in itself, is equivalent to the privatisation of one third of the generating capacity that exits.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> What is envisaged down the line is privatisation of the ESB. The criteria will be profit for private concerns which raises many serious questions, particularly in relation to the environment. Will we have the spectacle of companies vying with each other to win customers and, therefore, to generate more electricity needs, thereby using up more resources to generate electricity rather than a rational approach of generating what is needed while taking environmental concerns into consideration? Will there be a total <i>laissez-faire</i> approach where companies will push to burn as much oil or whatever they are using to generate electricity with no thought to the environment because profit comes first?</P>
    <P>What about the social needs of customers when electricity is supplied privately to households if, as I have no doubt, the Government and the main Opposition party have their way? What about social needs in areas of deprivation where people run into difficulties? What will happen to those people when the bottom line is the only consideration?</P>

        <b>:</b> I will come to that. Alternative routes could be taken to provide electricity more efficiently than by privatisation. The lesson of privatisation of the water supply in Britain, for example, has not been a happy one. I urge the Minister to study that example. Britain privatised water and other essential commodities in 1989 and there were huge price rises for the domestic customer as a result.</P>

      <P>In Britain, the pre-tax profits and the profits generally of the companies which benefited from the privatisation increased massively in the course of the 1990s. The number of defaulters, people who could not afford to pay their bills, rose dramatically because of the new procedures and the water supply of thousands of customers was cut off. That is the unhappy experience of people in Britain and it is inevitable under a privatised system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profits from a semi-State company which went to the State or, in other words, to benefit the common good of the people will now go to private shareholders with no accountability to the people as to where those profits are invested, whether in this country or in off-shore accounts. <Col N="1272" /> That is a blow to the taxpayer and to the services which have benefited from the surplus generated by State owned and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt cartels will move into this area further down the line. Oil and gas producing companies, for example, will join with others to produce electricity and to carve a huge sector of the market for themselves. We have, for example, the spectacle of Enterprise Oil with the huge rights which the Government gave it to explore gas and oil off the Mayo and Galway coasts. Reports of massive deposits of oil and gas are being talked down by this company. Extremely generous regimes for these companies as regards a return to the people have been agreed by Government. Companies enjoying a particular tax regime and paying no royalties, which is considerably more favourable than that demanded by Norway which has much experience in generating oil and gas, will join with others in an attempt to produce electricity more cheaply than others, including perhaps the ESB, because of the unfair advantage they have.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of what the Government Chief Whip said as regards this regime on 10 April. He said that Ireland operates a generous regime for search and discovery of oil and gas and that of 110 countries surveyed by an international group, Ireland offered the lowest corporation tax and royalty rates in the world with all drilling, labour, research, production, goods and construction costs deductible against tax. Companies availing of that type of regime will undoubtedly move into a privatised electricity market and will, therefore, undercut others until they have control of the market. This is a total sell out as regards the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the question of alternative methods of electricity supply should be developed enthusiastically and actively and should be promoted and encouraged by the Government. There are problems with the generation of electricity by wind and wave power and there are environmental concerns, etc. There are, however, huge benefits and we should move along those lines and actively pursue a policy in that regard.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech in detail but saw no reference to the effect this Bill will have on staff and staff levels in the ESB. Many people were quick and quite correct to praise the role of ESB workers during the terrible storms at Christmas time. They were heroes, about that there is no question, but I am afraid they have been sadly forgotten as regards this matter. Will the Minister outline the implications for staff or employment levels among all categories of workers in the ESB when one third of the capacity is farmed out?</P>

        <b>:</b> It should be a prime concern because that is no benefit to working people. I did not notice a provision in the Bill relating to the huge indebtedness of the ESB. As a semi-State company it carries a very large debt. Is there any provision for farming out the debt? Will these companies which are so anxious to come into the national grid which was built by the taxes of the Irish people be willing to take over some of the debt? I would think not. The banks, which made a fortune from the interest on the debts of semi-State companies, including the ESB, will be anxious to finance these companies to make a killing, but will provision be made to carry debt burdens? The Irish people will be left to carry those burdens in the form of the semi-State company that will remain.</P>
      <P>There are better alternatives to this mania for privatisation and selling off that which is in the ownership of the people, but they do not suit the vested interests that currently dominate our society and the European Union. They are the private national and multinational companies which are setting the pace in this privatisation. The alternative is to democratise State and semi-State companies and operate them in an entirely different way to that which currently obtains.</P>
      <P>The generation of electricity is an important activity which is in the interest of everybody on the island and a board, democratically made up of workers, consumers, Government, environmentalists and other interests, should be established so that we can have open and transparent accounts in electricity generation and distribution. We should have a debate on the cleanest ways electricity can be produced, and the costs involved, while keeping it in the ownership of the Irish people rather than letting it out to multinational companies and those for whom a profit is the prime objective.</P>
      <P>There are serious environmental considerations in this. The ESB has acted very arrogantly towards communities. Pylons and heavy duty cables were laid through the very heart of housing estates. That was not just arrogant but extremely reckless. People feel aggrieved and nervous as a result and I have no doubt it has caused serious health problems and will continue to cause them in the future. We must put in place a programme to relocate those pylons and heavy duty voltage lines, but all these issues could be addressed within public ownership and subject to democratic accountability. That would be the alternative to wholesale privatisation and a total sell-off which is the agenda of the dominant forces in the EU as well as powerful interests in our society.</P>

    <P>It is to those interests that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael largely dance and, unfortunately, there has <Col N="1274" /> been no reaction from the Opposition party &ndash; Labour.</P>

      <P>Who is the Deputy's partner? </P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is as a result of the EU directives that we have to allow for competition in the production of 25 per cent or more electricity in the future. I agree with Deputy Higgins that there are unforeseen problems in the area of competition for the production of electricity. Previous speakers talked about alternative methods of production. I want to highlight a problem that is developing in many rural communities, particularly along the western seaboard. We all agree that if there are alternatives to the production of electricity other than the traditional ways of peat, coal, oil and gas, we should utilise them. However, it is difficult to reconcile the establishment by new companies of wind farms in certain high amenity areas in the west. I refer in particular to the serious objections of a small rural community in Derrybrien, between Gort and Loughrea in County Galway. It may have come to the Minister's notice.</P>

      <P>They would, but that is wrong. <Col N="1275" /> I realise wind farming would be a blessing in disguise for the environment and for those who have strong views on the protection of the environment and the air we breathe, but it will not be a success if these companies locate in isolated communities which do not have the power to oppose such developments. If that element creeps into what is a good suggestion for the alternative production of electricity, we will not move forward in that respect. This small rural community vehemently opposed the efforts to locate those turbines in their area, although they were not completely negative about the proposal. They suggested that the companies should erect these constructions off-shore where they would not affect the people living in the community.</P>
      <P>We must remember that these isolated high amenity areas will require a network of power lines to transfer the electricity to the national grid. It will probably be necessary to have a transformer station in the locality. Traditionally, the ESB has been remiss in the location of transformer stations, even in urban areas where there is a high concentration of people. The company plants these ugly structures without landscaping the environment in which they are located.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the least young couples in rural and urban Ireland deserve from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is some acknowledgement of the difficulties they face. Deputy Dukes has already acknowledged the Minister of State's claim that more money is being spent on housing than at any time in the past decade, and I also acknowledge that. However, the Minister of State knows that the level of housing starts remains considerably lower than that witnessed during the last economic boom. No records are being set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant question in politics today is whether ordinary people are entitled to a fair share of the dividends of recent economic growth. As the economy expands, the level and quality of the services which make people's lives easier must also improve. Economic growth represents an opportunity to provide more and better services and not make do with the legacy of the past. Many of our European neighbours may envy our economic growth, but they would not have our social services for love nor money. Put simply, as our economy grows, it is not unreasonable for the people who have generated that growth to assume that the money spent on their needs <Col N="1279" /> should expand accordingly. Under this Government, it has not and will not over the next three years. Spending on housing as a percentage of wealth is declining, not increasing.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that never before has so much Government investment had such little impact on housing. It is precisely because of the contrast between input and results that the Opposition and others, including the EBS, have described the current position as a crisis. Speaking over the weekend, the head of lending at the EBS stated there was a need for housing units at around £70,000 to £80,000. They are not available, at least not in Dublin or surrounding counties. Instead starter homes in Dublin are selling for in the region of £120,000, requiring a couple to have a combined income of £43,000 plus to gain a mortgage under the criteria recommended by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>This is a crisis and it is not confined to Dublin and other large urban areas. In many rural areas where the dream of owning a home is still within the grasp of working people, the lack of support for sewerage and group water schemes is delaying developments. As a representative of a constituency adjoining Dublin, no one is more aware than I am of the extent of that city's growth. However, unless there is considerable investment in services in other parts of the country, Dublin will continue to grow. The amounts of money envisaged in the Government's service plan initiative will have minimal impact, no matter what the Minister of State claims.</P>
    <P>One influential economic commentator writing in a Sunday newspaper suggested that the free market approach to the housing crisis has failed. He said house prices have soared well ahead of building costs and rents have been increased not only to reflect the higher house values but also the consequential shortage of houses for rent. The capacity of the State to respond to this problem is limited by the lack of an adequate land supply in which to build itself or allow other people to build, with an adequate social housing component, or allocate land to allow people build their own homes. Speculation in building land is one reason the cost of housing has increased. The balance between encouraging people to make zoned land available and the provision of land at reasonable cost has clearly swung excessively.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason my party has tabled an amendment to the motion to increase the capital gains levels of housing land. It is also for that reason I find it difficult to understand the Minister of State's refusal to contemplate a national housing commission to debate what action might be necessary. Clearly measures above and beyond the ordinary are required. Implementing in a vacuum without adequate discussion will only give rise to controversy and opposition. However, through a national commission, a consensus can be arrived at to respond to the crisis, and many of the difficulties which might normally be experi<Col N="1280" /> enced in implementation could be easily overcome.</P>
    <P>The rise in house prices has had an effect beyond the normal housing market. Many of the schemes used to improve housing standards or to allow tenants of local authorities to purchase houses have been badly affected by the rise in house prices. In my county, the number of people availing of the tenant purchase scheme has fallen considerably. Problems are not solely confined to the purchase of houses. There remains a considerable amount of badly maintained and derelict properties which could add to available housing stock if funding were available for schemes such as work in lieu, essential repairs and grants for disabled persons to refurbish their houses. Perhaps the Minister of State will consider providing 100 per cent funding for the last scheme.</P>
    <P>It is time to reassess housing policy in a fundamental fashion. Young people are being priced out of the housing market. More people than ever are sleeping rough. Profiteering is rampant and queues for local authority housing are increasing dramatically. This is a crisis and these are issues a housing commission could address. All that stands in the way is the complacency of a Government which refuses to recognise the evidence before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Three factors have contributed to the escalating price of housing throughout the country and not just in Dublin: the planning sections of local authorities, developers and lending agencies. The three combined have made it almost impossible for young couples to make the dream of providing a home for themselves a reality. Unfortunately, it is now only a dream.</P>
      <P>There are serious problems throughout the country, and in the Galway County Council area, with which the Minster of State is familiar, there is a clear indication of what is happening. The housing waiting list there has increased from about 400 in 1996 to about 900 today. I do not blame the Government for this huge growth. Over the years, local authorities have struggled to provide housing for emergencies. Only if people had five or six children and they lived in absolutely dire conditions would there be the possibility of them obtaining a council house in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Prices in the private housing sector have escalated unbelievably. This can be traced back to the role of the planning authorities in counties which rezoned very little land, if rezoning can be mentioned in the current climate. In the revisions of county, city and town development plans, only small acreages are rezoned for housing. This <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement every time there is a revision of the plan leads to huge competition between developers for that small, scarce area of land. Inevitably the increased price of land is passed on to the private house dweller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister said he was disappointed at the uptake of social housing. It is a pity rural communities do not take up the offer <Col N="1281" /> to provide housing to combat widespread rural depopulation. I hope the Minister will provide increased funding to rural communities to provide houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. I acknowledge there is a housing problem and that the Government is tackling it. An Action Programme for the Millennium specifically pledges a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups. It also embraces improvement in the extension of the social housing programmes generally. Substantially increased resources are being provided and there is provision for local authority housing that will allow 4,500 new starts this year. That is the highest level of new house starts to be sanctioned in the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>The Opposition is demanding 10,000 starts each year for the next four years. That target is unrealistic and unachievable. Even if it could be afforded, the construction industry has not the manpower or the capacity to cope with that level of house building. There is a building boom, construction output is soaring and there is a major shortage of skilled operatives. The Opposition seems unaware of these facts, even though they are common knowledge. I did not think the Opposition would stoop so low as to express these aspirations in attempting to cod the public by tabling this motion. Even it could not be guilty of such blatant cynicism and opportunism. I hope we are not sinking to a new low whereby the Opposition makes many calls in its motions when we know there are several problems and skilled shortages in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>It is becoming impossible for couples to own a home without taking out sky high mortgages. Even the combined incomes of some partners will not qualify for a loan because of soaring house costs. Runaway pricing makes it uneconomic for many young people to purchase a home in Ireland. There is no point in having a growth economy if house prices force the workforce to emigrate in search of cheaper homes. People should not have to incur lifetime debts to enable them buy houses in their own country. The increased price of houses will inescapably result in some people, who would have bought their own homes, looking to local authorities to provide them with houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is at the top of the Government's priorities. The Minister is implementing many of the Bacon recommendations. The Government is taking the necessary action to increase housing supply, to improve access to housing for lower income groups, to improve the housing conditions <Col N="1282" /> of local authority tenants and will continue to take any further action deemed necessary. However, it will not introduce half baked measures that will impact negatively on the long-term stability of the housing market. I ask the Opposition to support the Government's measures which are geared to provide more serviced sites for the provision of houses at affordable prices.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Flynn for sharing his time. As house prices escalate fewer couples can aspire to owning their own homes. We ought to head towards the European model where more and more people are in the private rented sector. However, this is problematic for us because we do not have security of tenure. This is a major problem which was outlined at the recent Threshold conference opened by the Minister. It is amazing that the working group document on security of tenure has been with the Department of Justice since 1996. Given its importance, when will it be published? The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, has been undermined and we have had the recent judgment from Judge Devally which illustrates that people are using loopholes in that Act. Dublin Corporation may say work has to be carried out so that sitting tenants can be turfed out. This is dreadful and it is happening all the time in the city. There may be constitutional difficulties here. I have heard various stories from eminent lawyers. Will the Minister address this problem? In Ringsend, Irishtown, in the docklands area where there was to be 20 per cent social housing &ndash; this was the carrot for local people &ndash; if they accepted high rise buildings around them, a developer is going to An Bord Pleánála to challenge this and to the courts. People have been misled in Ringsend, Irishtown. We have to address that constitutional problem and I ask the Minister to look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy, was a young Minister for Local Government in the early 1970s when the first ever development plan was adopted in Dublin. Built into that plan was provision for three satellite towns for a population of 100,000. For a number of years, in succession to the late Senator Jack Fitzgerald, I chaired ERDO. We projected that a population of 160,000 might have to be accommodated in the eastern region up to 2001. That report, while representative of the local authorities of the region, planning officers, engineers, etc., was rejected in certain quarters and was not implemented. The Minister's Department was represented on that body. Its incompetence in ensuring the recommendations were implemented has led to a situation where this Government is not capable of providing young couples with affordable houses. Those on local authority housing lists, who cannot afford to purchase a home, are adversely affected by the lack of housing. There are many reasons for this. When the Minister reviews the debate and the issues that have arisen will he <Col N="1283" /> appoint somebody to advise him monthly, quarterly or whatever on the Serviced Land Initiative with a view to its implementation on a fast track basis? </P>
      <P>One of the scandals in the greater Dublin area is the incompetence of the engineering personnel, at department and local authority level in Dublin Corporation. They have spent approximately five or six years on the requirement to provide a greater Dublin drainage scheme upgrade at Ringsend. The draining of the north fringe could facilitate a population of 20,000. As Sean Lemass said in the 1960s, the way to control building land is to service more than is needed. We have been incapable of doing that for whatever reason. There is no point in wasting time listing the reasons for not achieving it. Instead we should ask what can we do about it.</P>
      <P>Young couples in the greater Dublin area are paying between £20,000 and £40,000 more than they should for their first home. There was a certificate of reasonable valuation when it was not needed. Under the small builders' scheme, local authorities sold sites at a predetermined level to builders who provided a home for a preset figure.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, in the second half of 1995, made available valuable lands on the market to private builders who should not have been provided with this land. If it had been left in the ownership of South Dublin and Fingal county councils serviced sites would have been available to building contractors at predetermined figures and houses could have been provided for young people. That was not the case and it was purely as a result of pigeon-hole economics. One arm of the State was taking in resources and another was denied the facility.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a major burden of responsibility at this time in his reign. I sincerely ask that he ensure the fast-track implementation of the recommendations which have come forward so that progress can be achieved and service sites can be made available, thereby allowing young couples to purchase their first home. This is the one item which will blight the record of achievements of the Government and its predecessors. We have not been capable of providing young couples with houses at a reasonable and realistic price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issues facing people on the housing list and the general housing crisis. However, we must be extremely careful of the language we use and how we put forward the various proposals. The Opposition, in putting forward its proposals, has attempted to raise the expectations of unfortunate people who find themselves on the housing list because some of the solutions which it put forward are not realistic or achievable, and it knows that quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing crisis has not arisen overnight. It has existed since the early 1990s and it has been growing over the years. Successive Governments <Col N="1284" /> have not dealt with it in an adequate way. Part of the problem relates to local government. During the 20 years in which I have served in local government, particularly since the early 1990s, we have not analysed the housing list sufficiently to determine its profile and the methods to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The traditional list no longer exists. It normally consisted of young people or married couples who were seeking housing accommodation, but that is no longer the case. It now includes lone parents, separated people, both men and women, and young couples who are unable to purchase their own home and who, in accepting rent allowance, are forced into the social welfare system. Therefore, there are a number of issues involved and the local authorities have a major role to play.</P>
    <P>I would like to see, first, an analysis to determine exactly how many people are on the housing list. This is happening at present. It is unusual that in Kilkenny, for example, there are 900 people on the list and in Carlow there are 1,000 people. However, when the list is analysed those numbers will not stand up and the profile of the housing list will be different. Then it will be for the local authorities to come up with imaginative ways of dealing with the numbers.</P>
    <P>The county development plan will play an important role in this regard. On the zoning of land and planning permission, people can be encouraged to build their own houses within their communities. A development plan must be developed in towns to encourage those who wish to be housed in their local communities to stay there. Houses and land should be available and initiatives in place which will ensure that separated men and women and people who find themselves alone are housed.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have sufficient funds to assist in purchasing homes through the shared ownership schemes or in buying back private houses for the local authority stock. However, the cost of these houses is such that when they come on the open market the local authority and the people involved in the shared ownership scheme cannot afford to buy them. If steps were taken to ensure that starter homes were made available in the bigger housing schemes for which planning applications are now coming before the local authorities, it would ensure that young people who are starting out in life and trying to purchase a home are accommodated by way of affordable houses. There are initiatives which can be taken locally. It is only through a combined effort that we will succeed in reducing the numbers on the list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>There is a housing problem but it is being dealt with and there is a great deal being done. Naturally, I do not agree with the Opposition motion although it contains a few good points. The national housing commission will be a main demand of the social partners when the next pay deal is being negotiated. There <Col N="1285" /> is a great deal of merit in it. Many people feel they can make a contribution and I would like to see them involved in it.</P>
      <P>There are two elements to the problem, the provision of housing and the use of existing housing. The provision of housing is being worked on successfully by the Government by way of the service land initiative. I want to make a few points about the use of existing housing. Under the latest redrawing of the boundaries, my constituency is now a three-seater &ndash; it was a four-seater constituency. Therefore, over the past ten or 15 years the population of the constituency has been greatly reduced. There are a great many under-used houses, most of which are private but many of which are owned by the local authority, and many of them are occupied by grandmothers. I am not suggesting that these people must move out having reared their families there, but many elderly people have told me that if they take in a lodger or rent a room, they will be forced to pay tax. This is an area which we have not addressed and on which we should make progress. We need to give a loud signal that all those empty rooms should be used and that these people will not be taxed. Other older people fear that they will lose their free schemes.</P>

      <P>This does not come under the Minister's remit but the Ministers concerned must get together on it. If a person's son is unemployed and living at home, he will not be entitled to social welfare benefits. As a result, such people move down the road to a private flat where they are entitled to social welfare and rent allowance. Current policy is resulting in much stupidity. We are not making best use of existing housing stock and that needs to be done. Dublin Corporation is encouraging people to trade down and take a senior citizen flat. Under that scheme many tenants would hand back their three or four bedroom houses and take senior citizen flats if they received £1,500 or £2,000. We need to recycle existing private and public houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned Ballymun in my constituency, where marvellous work is being done and there are some good ideas, in particular the proposal to sell some of the houses to reverse the social mix and provide some private houses from the outset.</P>
      <P>The position in Dublin is rather messy. There is practically no building land left in the Dublin Corporation area. My colleague, Deputy Lawlor, took a swipe at Dublin Corporation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The four local authorities in Dublin should work together. There is a need for one housing list in Dublin. That would mean the county would get some of the starts which would have gone to <Col N="1286" /> Dublin Corporation. This year the Minister has provided for 600 starts in Dublin. Many Opposition politicians are saying that it is not enough, yet the city council has agreed to build only 400 houses because we had to seek the permission of the Minister to convert the money for 200 starts to refurbishment work. It is not just about building houses but about the quality of buildings and the standard of living.</P>
    <P>Everyone talks about the lovely young couple. Only 10 per cent of those on the Dublin Corporation housing list are young couples with children; 20 per cent are single and 60 per cent are lone parents many of whom are genuine and need to be catered for but others are chancers. One may find that the boyfriend is on the list as a single person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a serious housing problem. The effects are being felt in the number of evictions which has increased dramatically in Dublin city. A small group of landlords are taking full advantage and increasing rents well above the rate of inflation. Those on low pay have no option but to share with a number of others. I agree that the Housing Act, 1992, should be reviewed to provide more security for tenants. This would have a beneficial effect by reducing the pressure to buy.</P>
      <P>The Opposition inform us that the economy was performing well when it was in office. It should have known this would create problems in the housing market but, unlike its successor, it failed to act. The Bacon report was a step in the right direction. It was a mistake, however, to remove the investor from the apartment market as it meant that demand in the rental sector would not be met. It is a question of supply and demand. The Serviced Land Initiative will have a huge effect in the next 18 months. It will result in an additional 100,000 starts. The increase in local authority funding will also have a significant effect.</P>
      <P>The housing co-operative in Ringsend in my constituency has built between 50 and 60 houses in recent years at an affordable price for young married couples. Such schemes are a feature of the market in other countries. I disagree with the proposal that the first-time buyer's grant be increased&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the fervent desire of every couple to own their own home. In 1985 the then Minister for the Environment, Padraig Flynn, launched his document, A Plan for Social Housing. The response of the Dublin County Council manager was that he would not implement it.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael's response to the housing problem has been erratic. On a previous occasion it introduced the £5,000 surrender grant which resulted in the destabilisation and destruction of established communities. I would not like the current problem to be addressed in a similar manner.</P>
      <P>The motion highlights the need for 10,000 starts per annum. A previous Government informed local authorities that funding allocated for housing in previous years that remained unspent was being withdrawn. That marked a change in policy. On the shared ownership scheme, the income limits should be changed as they are unrealistic. The current formula of £12,500 for the main income earner does not work given that the average price of a house in Dublin is between £90,000 and £100,000. It is an area in which Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil local authority members, particularly in Dublin, have shouldered their responsibilities and have suffered the abuse which followed from that. On my local authority of Fingal and previously when a member of Dublin County Council I did not see the Labour, Socialist or Green Party members support any proposal to provide additional land for housing which is the only way to reduce the cost of housing. Fortunately, we have seen a scheme for servicing housing land come on stream.</P>
      <P>There was reference to Dublin Corporation's problem with the existing housing list. I am now a poacher turned gamekeeper. I have served on Dublin County Council but I now represent a constituency in the Dublin Corporation area and I have seen the report which the Dublin city manager has presented to the members. If Dublin Corporation had not been so avaricious in selling off all of its housing land bank in Fingal for £11 million, we might see people on the corporation and council housing lists being housed. I warn those in Wicklow, Kildare and Meath to be very careful.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate which highlights the need to address this issue. If we share our experience and wisdom instead of being confrontational, we might address the problems of those who need housing in Dublin city and county and throughout the country in a positive way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am delighted to be associated with this motion because the situation is out of control and we have a serious housing crisis. Everyone in this House has experience of this crisis from weekly constituency clinics. I could <Col N="1288" /> give a list the length of my arm of the problems experienced. In Christmas week last, Threshold, the housing charity, dealt with 21 evictions of people from private rented accommodation. The problems in the rented sector are linked to the problem of home ownership. People simply cannot afford to buy houses. A single person earning £20,000 will only get a mortgage for £55,000 which is unrealistic given today's house prices.</P>
      <P>Last week I was made aware of three men in their thirties who are sharing a rented apartment. They must be earning relatively good salaries because they are paying 46 per cent tax yet they cannot afford to buy a house. They cannot get on to the bottom rung of the house ownership ladder and feel they are facing the rest of their working lives in rented accommodation. This is in a country where we hold home ownership in high esteem. A home owner is held in esteem, is good for a reference and is given a certain credence by the courts and elsewhere. This status is denied to many people because they cannot access affordable accommodation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Eoin Ryan and others when they say implementation of the Bacon report has merely reduced the amount of accommodation available for rent. We are now seeing the effects of that. Landlords are increasing rents without due notice. In some cases rents have been increased to £200, £400 and even £600 per month. Landlords are entitled to do this. Not content with using their rental income to pay the mortgage on a property, landlords are now making a profit as well as enjoying the property's increased capital value. There must be some control of rents. The rights of tenants must be addressed.</P>
      <P>There must also be control of the quality of rented accommodation. Not many landlords have registered with their local authority as they are required to do. Why not? Probably because they fear they will have to pay tax. Last year alone, in the Southern Health Board region, £17 million was paid out in rent allowances. This is estimated to be only 20 per cent of the rental market as many landlords will not accept tenants who are in receipt of rent allowance.</P>
      <P>That people cannot aspire to buying their own homes and are caught in the trap of rented accommodation is creating serious problems for the fabric of society. I am delighted to support this motion and I hope the Minister will take notice of our proposals.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for sharing her time. I have only four minutes to speak so I will get straight to the point. In 1998 Dublin Corporation built 148 houses. The corporation did not build houses in 1989, it built 25 in 1990, 74 in 1991, 80 in 1992, 71 in 1993, 277 in 1994, 366 in 1995, 310 in 1996, 181 in 1997 and 230 is the estimate for 1998. Therein lies the genesis of this unprecedented housing crisis. In poorer times when we were trying to form a government in the early 1980s, we were building 1,750 houses per year for Dublin Corporation. <Col N="1289" /> When we had hardly any money we built Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. Deputy McGennis makes the often repeated comment &ndash; it may be true or it may not &ndash; that the £5,000 grant took the best people out of corporation estates. Well, the people who are there are good enough; they are getting by all right, thank you very much.</P>

We are talking about a population moving from the west coast to the east coast.

      <P>It is time we gave consideration to building houses in large numbers outside Dublin for those on the housing list in Dublin and to providing the necessary infrastructure to let people get in and out of Dublin. That is not simply a recommendation made off the top of my head. It is contained in the report on EMU which warns of the danger of asset inflation which may have implications for Partnership 2000 and, in turn, may have implications for meeting EMU criteria. We must find innovative ways to do that. We should be innovative and build enough local authority houses to meet the needs of the people. This would increase the supply of houses and drive down the demand for them. Such local authority houses need not all be built on land in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I agree with everything Deputy Gay Mitchell said. The housing crisis is a source of concern and great hardship for first time hou<Col N="1290" /> sebuyers, many of whom have been priced out of the housing market. It is noteworthy that the property supplements of many of our national daily papers contain more pages than the newspapers. The crisis in housing is such that a modest three bedroomed semi-detached house of approximately 1,300 square foot in a far flung suburb miles from Dublin is selling at approximately £125,000. This demand cannot be dampened as tens of thousands of people remain on the housing list. The problem is nationwide and not confined to Dublin or our other major cities. House prices throughout the country have almost doubled in the past five years, resulting in large numbers resorting to the public housing waiting list. In Laois there are 950 applicants on the housing waiting list, while in Offaly there are more than 1,000 on it. This year's public housing programme in County Laois will provide for 60 starts, which is inadequate given that the list is lengthening on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>One adverse consequence of the housing shortage will be increased wage demands. We have seen evidence of this as trades unions argue strongly for wage increases, listing house prices as a justification for their demands. The reality is that wage demands granted on the back of spiralling house prices have the capacity to wreck our economy. Having regard to the supply and demand argument, one must assume that if the demand cannot be dampened then supply must be increased. Deputy Mitchell is correct on this. The key to solving the problem is to increase the supply by assisting the public and private sectors. Large scale rezoning of large tracts of land in and near Dublin is one option, but a sound and co-ordinated regional policy must be prioritised. Dublin and the east coast have become top heavy, resulting in traffic chaos and infrastructural gridlock which have become a feature of life in our capital city.</P>
      <P>It seems the first time house buyer's grant and the reduction of stamp duty have merely added to the cost of houses and, through competititon, the apparent savings for the average couple have pushed up house prices rather than helped subsidise their cost. The answer put forward by the financial institutions has been to throw money at couples by ignoring longstanding guidelines on the salary:mortgage ratio to the peril of many entering the market. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the recently introduced insidious 35 year mortgage being offered by some lenders to first time house buyers. To the unsuspecting couple, this carefully wrapped and softly presented package can amount to no more than an elaborate confidence trick which will consign many couples to repayments month after month until they qualify for the old age pension. Such mortgages or millstones should be accompanied by sufficient warning to adequately advise as to the dangers and commitments involved and house buyers should be dissuaded from taking this poisonous carrot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increased supply of houses is the only <Col N="1291" /> answer to this problem. Careful and co-ordinated planning for growth should be undertaken in the Leinster area in particular. Towns like Edenderry, Portarlington and Portlaoise, where a building boom is being experienced should be allowed expand and develop in a co-ordinated way. The Minister should initiate a forum involving planners and county managers from Kildare, Wicklow, Meath, Offaly, Laois and Louth to address this problem. The difficulty is that we have no planning or long-term strategy to deal with a problem that has the capacity to wreck the economic achievement of recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the Government speakers who acknowledged there is a crisis in the public and private housing sectors. Many of the proposals in our motion, if accepted, would help alleviate this problem. More and more young couples are finding it impossible to buy their own homes and are going on to the housing waiting list. There has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of applications for local authority houses in the past two years.</P>
      <P>I agree with the novel idea promoted by Deputy Gay Mitchell. If the Government ensured that the west was granted Objective One status, many people from the west would not move to work in Dublin and there would be a reduction in the competition for scarce resources required to provide houses, road infrastructure and other facilities. If the Government supported the west, many people would stay in the west.</P>
      <P>The number of people on the public housing waiting list does not reflect the true position. Many people who cannot afford to buy their own homes have not applied for local authority houses because they realise the Government has not allocated adequate resources to local authorities to meet a fraction of the demand for local authority houses. The failure of the Government to do this is counter productive as it will cost the country more in the long run. There has been a phenomenal increase in the amount paid out by health boards in rent subsidies. In 1989 the health boards paid out £6.1 million in rent subsidies, while in 1997 the health boards paid out £75.3 million in rent subsidies, which represents an increase of more than 1,200 per cent in eight years. There are approximately 50,000 people in receipt of rent subsidies and half of those are not on the public housing waiting list because they know they do not have any hope of getting a house. That the State is paying out £75 million a year in rent subsidies while neglecting to allocate resources for local authority housing represents bad management. The sum of £75 million would build more than 1,000 houses a year, one-tenth of the number we proposed in our motion. That amount which is being paid out by the State in rent subsidies could be used to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report by a review group on the role of supplementary welfare in rented accommodation was published in December 1995. This group recom<Col N="1292" /> mended transferring the administration of rent subsidies to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. An interdepartmental group with representatives from the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Finance was set up to examine this matter and three years later it is still examining it. Will the Minister indicate if the Administration will implement the recommendations of that review group, if the interdepartmental group will report on its findings and will the Administration explain why the rent subsidy scheme cannot be transferred to the local authorities, as proposed in our motion?</P>

      <P>I compliment my Fine Gael colleagues on tabling this timely motion. More time has been devoted to discussing the housing crisis than any other issue in the past year and a half. That is because of the energy of Members such as Deputies Hayes and others. We recognise there is a housing crisis. It is a source of major hardship for many young couples and others. The more proposals we can put forward to tackle this crisis the better. I hope the Minister will not dismiss them. I heard him speak yesterday and I thought he was rather dismissive and critical of some of the proposals put forward by Fine Gael, which is most unfair. Good proposals have been put forward this evening which could be easily adopted and which would make a difference.</P>
      <P>If sewage treatment facilities were provided in many rural villages, it would reduce the competition for houses in urban areas as a large number of people would move to live in rural villages. In-depth planning is not permitted in rural villages. As only roadside planning is permitted, selling land is not an attractive option for many people. I put forward that suggestion and I ask the official present to put it to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. He is supportive of providing sewage treatment facilities in villages throughout the country, which is a measure I would support.</P>
      <P>A large number of applicants who have applied for single rural cottages are experiencing considerable difficulties in transferring sites in the Land Registry. I suggest such applications should be prioritised and a delay in transfer of a site should not result in applicants having to wait three or four years to be housed in such cottages.  In many instances, they move into the towns to go into group schemes. That would remove another source of competition.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, introduced the principle of public/private partnerships last year in the Finance Act. There is scope for more of this philosophy and more services could be provided through this mechanism. For example, large land owners would gain substantially if sewerage schemes were provided through a partnership between the local authority and the individuals who stood to benefit, and more land would be serviced as a result.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have our feet on the ground were not amused, but greatly shocked, when we read of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's, ignorance of the housing crisis. There is an extreme shortage of housing throughout the State. Figures of 6,500 and 1,500 are quoted for the local authority housing waiting lists in Dublin city and Fingal, respectively. Is this the type of society over which the Minister of State and his Government want to preside &ndash; one where the lists grow but home starts sanctioned by the Government are scandalously low?</P>
      <P>The population structure is changing. The 25 to 44 years age group represents about 30 per cent of the population of the greater Dublin area. The household size is falling and now stands at 2.6 persons per housing unit, while in 1986 it stood at 3.1 persons per domestic dwelling. The effect of net immigration to the capital, from both abroad and other parts of the country, as people find employment there, also drives up the numbers seeking homes.</P>
      <P>The Government must look radically at the problem. It is a problem not only for those who wish to have a home of their own, but also for every family which shares the aspirations of their children to own the hearth and fire and all. Most parents are prepared to financially assist their children to scrape together a deposit so that they can have a stake in this country, even if that means their children are paying for their independence for 20 years through a mortgage. Unless a parent has recently received a large redundancy payment or is capable of raising a second mortgage on their family home, all prospects of seeing their children maintain themselves in the traditional manner are gone.</P>
      <P>Local authority housing lists are growing faster than the queue for hospital trolleys. Couples with two jobs are unable to afford the deposit on a modest home of their own. The Government must be prepared to take action to stop this.</P>
      <P>The Government must immediately deal with the delays which still exist in An Bord Pleanála. We are told decisions should be taken by the board within 16 weeks. However, this is more likely to take 20 to 24 weeks in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Government must review the first time home buyer's scheme. Not only should it increase the grant, it should also extend the scope of the scheme. The scheme should apply to the purchase of second hand homes where the vendor is purchasing a new housing unit. This would have the advantage of giving the first time purchaser a real jump in the housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must look at the number of older housing units which are under occupied, particularly in the metropolitan areas. There are housing units which were designed for families and which have all the community supports in place to service family needs; however, they are not occupied by families but are the homes of ageing parents who have reared their children &ndash; who themselves have been forced to move to <Col N="1294" /> outer suburbia. Those houses are too big for the needs of those who continue to live in them.</P>
    <P>The Government must find imaginative ways of opening these houses up to meet current demands. Innovative tax allowances to allow for the discounting of rental income would bring life back into these areas. Other options exist, such as the State enabling and promoting the development of sheltered home units located in these areas, which would encourage elderly people to vacate their original homes and move to secured accommodation with all the important services which the older person requires. This accommodation should be provided in the areas where these people have lived their lives and where they wish to end their days among their friends and neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Hayes on raising this very important issue. As we approach the new millennium, many aspects of social policy are being examined to see if they are still relevant to modern demands. One of the basic needs of society today is affordable and decent housing.</P>
      <P>The commitment to that ideal, which was once so honourable, is now in danger of being placed on the back burner, as our economy stampedes to new levels of prosperity, once thought to be unattainable. However, the old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats does not hold true for many of our citizens. It is unbelievable that there has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of applications for local authority housing. There are 2,000 people in Sligo waiting for housing. Private sector rents are continuing to increase and the number of homeless persons is also continuing to increase.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to help deal with this problem by abolishing stamp duty on second hand houses for first time buyers, increasing the first time buyer's grant and establishing a national housing commission. The planning system has become part of the infrastructure log jam in a variety of areas, including roads, public transport and, in particular, housing. There have been extreme difficulties with rural planning.</P>
      <P>Supply constraints have been a significant factor in the recent spiralling of house prices and increased accommodation costs have put pressure on labour costs and reversed the effects of Ireland's competitiveness. The current legislation, which dates from 1993, needs to be updated and related matters should be streamlined.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Bacon report in respect of the need for higher density housing and more serviced land for residential development should be urgently implemented to help alleviate the housing crisis. The current review of the planning legislation should ensure that planning systems positively encourage the development of public/private partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I frequently get requests for housing in the Sligo area. More than 2,000 people in Sligo town, alone, are looking for housing. Last Monday 50 houses were sold in a private scheme and more <Col N="1295" /> than 500 people tried to buy them. Those who were unsuccessful were very disappointed.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála's 1996 annual report stated there had been a massive increase in the number of planning appeals. Up to 3,424 appeals were lodged in 1996. Previous speakers indicated the delayed response time by the board to many queries. Local authorities should also buy land in towns and villages to encourage people to develop the counties.</P>

      <P>I support the motion and the second amendment. I listened with interest to the speech of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, last night. He came into the House to present a patchwork of Government housing measures, as if it was a comprehensive policy. The truth is that there is no coherent Government policy to meet the biggest housing crisis this country has seen since the late 1960s.</P>
      <P>Incredibly, the Minister of State dismissed the call for 10,000 local authority housing starts over the next four years and referred to the &ldquo;danger of returning to the large, soulless peripheral local authority housing estates of the past&rdquo;. This is very interesting in the context of current tribunals. It was the absence of planning, bad planning and sometimes downright corrupt planning, presided over by the dominant political elements in this State, that led to the housing and environmental mess of the 1970s and 1980s. We are still living with the legacy. The alternative offered by the Minister is to refuse to undertake a comprehensive public housing programme. Once again, misery is being stored up for the future.</P>
      <P>In questioning the need &ndash; highlighted in the motion and the second amendment &ndash; to strengthen tenants' rights, the Minister of State seemed to equate the property rights of landlords with the housing rights of tenants. There is no equivalence. The right to a home is more fundamental than any abstract right to property. It is long past time that a Government listened to those with dire housing needs: the homeless on our streets; young people starting out in life who cannot afford a home, even those on an average industrial wage; tenants living in sub-standard accommodation with no security of tenure and grossly inflated rents; and the elderly enduring housing poverty in their final years. We are all concerned about their difficulties and the injustices that hold some of them in a state of permanent need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the contributions from all sides of the House that the current situation with regard to housing is a matter of wide concern and this concern is no less keenly felt on this side of the House. There should be no doubt that the Government regards addressing housing needs as a top priority and an essential element of its overall social policies.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies who have contributed to the debate that account will be taken of all the issues raised by them in the ongoing consideration and development of housing policy, particularly with regard to the need to provide affordable housing for those currently unable to secure adequate housing from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The problems we have been experiencing in the housing sector in recent years are a direct result of a supply-demand imbalance which this Government has proved itself determined to redress. Never in the history of the State have we achieved a better performance in terms of housing output. Housing output reached a new record in 1998 at over 41,500 units. Ireland has the highest housing output per thousand of population in Europe, twice any other EU country and more than three times the UK level.</P>
      <P>The Government has systematically set out to address the various factors constraining housing supply, but such measures inevitably take time. The serviced land initiative to increase the supply of serviced land for housing involves Government funding of £44 million which will result in an overall investment of over £100 million in land servicing and access, yielding some 100,000 additional sites for housing. This is the equivalent of an additional two and a half years' housing output. Planning authorities have already been advised to promote higher densities at appropriate locations. In addition, consultants are currently finalising draft planning guidelines on residential density and these will be available for public consultation by the end of the month. These measures are all designed to increase housing supply.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, indicated last night, demand side interventions such as increases in the new house grant from £3,000 to £10,000 are not appropriate solutions to the problem of affordability for first time buyers. It is widely acknowledged that such measures would serve only to increase house prices and widen even further the affordability gap that so many Deputies have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A crash local authority house building programme of 10,000 starts a year is not a solution. One has only to think through the implications: an adverse impact on the supply and price of building land if local authorities were to purchase the tracts of land that would be necessary, ensuring further upward pressure on land and house prices; the long-term social effects of creating large, peripheral local authority housing estates that such a massive programme would require; <Col N="1297" /> and finally the already serious capacity constraints on the building industry.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made proposals on the planning process. Upon coming into office this Government initiated the most comprehensive review of the planning system since the introduction of the first Planning and Development Act in 1963. The Government has, within the past few weeks, approved the drafting of a major Planning and Development Bill which will completely revise and replace all existing planning legislation. It is hoped that this Bill will be published by mid-year.</P>
    <P>The Government has substantially increased the local authority house building programme, but within sustainable levels, and grants available to the voluntary housing sector have been increased substantially to enable the sector to contribute more to social housing provision. The income eligibility limits for the shared ownership scheme have been increased to allow more households to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The budget provisions for housing this year concentrated on assisting the most vulnerable in our society &ndash; the disabled, the elderly and the homeless. Homelessness, which was referred to by a number of Deputies, is not just a lack of accommodation. The profile of homelessness has changed in recent years. It follows that the response to homelessness requires more than just providing accommodation. It means providing the necessary support services to enable homeless people to get out of the cycle of homelessness. Because of the complexity of the problem of homelessness and the number of agencies involved in providing accommodation and services for homeless people, the Government has established a cross-departmental team, chaired and serviced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the motion and congratulate Deputy Hayes and the Fine Gael Party for using Private Members' time as an opportunity to raise this important issue. The present housing crisis is unprecedented. It is unacceptable that there has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of applications for local authority housing since the last housing assessment in 1996. It is unacceptable, and the Government stands condemned for not responding to the crisis. It is clear that the Celtic tiger economy is not improving the standard of living of many of our citizens. In a time of such unprecedented financial surpluses it is a disgrace that the level of homelessness is increasing, that more and more people cannot afford a home and that the waiting list for local authority housing is lengthening.</P>
      <P>In County Limerick almost 1,000 people are awaiting council housing. With the construction of <i>circa</i> 100 local authority houses per annum it would take over ten years to house everybody. It is very frustrating to see families living in unacceptable conditions, in mobile homes, condemned buildings or in private flats where the occupants cannot properly feed themselves because of the enormous rents charged. People are suffering without proper heating.</P>
      <P>In a small town in County Limerick a constituent informed me that he is paying £78.50 per week for a flat which is the only available one in the area. If heating is used he is charged £15 per week extra. This is exploitation and it must stop. The Government must immediately and dramatically increase the provision of finance to local authorities to allow 10,000 housing starts each year for the next five years. The Government must substantially increase contributions to the voluntary housing sector. It must respond to those in our society who are endeavouring to start off in life, to those who are without the resources to provide a home for themselves, and to the many children who are living in deplorable conditions. The Government must respond to those who had aspirations to own their own homes but because of the dramatic increase in house prices are now unable to purchase them. The Government must also respond to those who are living in overcrowded conditions, where parents and their children are sleeping in a single room with relatives, or in a single rented room because they cannot afford anything better.</P>
      <P>The housing situation is a scandal. It must not be tolerated any longer and I call on the Government to respond immediately. I congratulate Fine Gael for raising this issue.</P>

      <P>I support this worthwhile motion. It is timely that it should now be debated in the House. As a member of a local authority, I am aware of the need for a major cash injection for housing. There is a need for more houses to be built by every local authority, including Longford County Council. Members of local authorities are aware of how often they are approached by people who are not even on the priority list for housing. It is vital for people who are living in extremely bad conditions that the housing stock is improved in local authority areas.</P>
      <P>In many cases the rental subsidy scheme involves people going from the health board to the local authority and back again. It would make sense to centre the scheme in the local authority. I have discussed this matter with local authority officials and they agree with my suggestion. It does not make sense that people must go to the health board and the local authority. Another issue is the income limits. It can go against people if there is one earner in a household. They are in a better position if there are two earners. I ask the Minister to examine this aspect.</P>
      <P>I support the IBEC document. It contains much important information and many solid proposals on planning. I hope the Minister will consider the entire planning issue because it often causes delays in the development of housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members on all sides who contributed to the debate. I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, did not come to the House to respond to the motion. I hope he is not having another chin wag with the Taoiseach. On the last occasion he was the note taker at the meeting between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Perhaps there are ominous signs for the future, but it is not good that the Minister of State with direct responsibility in this area is not present to respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>The heart of the issue is that the Government has failed to recognise the extent of the problem in the housing market, including the massive increase in the national housing list. Deputies on all sides meet people every week at their constituency clinics who are living in appallingly overcrowded housing. They may have been on a housing list for two or three years, but they are not progressing further up the list. They are demoralised and they are getting no help from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five years ago a couple who were first time buyers could afford to buy a house in Dublin for £63,000. The average price of a house in Dublin now is approximately £135,000. Average income people are completely priced out of the first time buyers' market. People seeking typical starter homes have no chance of getting a house. This is putting huge pressure on the private rented sector. There are countless evictions in, as Deputy Clune said, the Cork area and Dublin on a weekly basis. People are being turfed out on the street because they cannot afford to pay their rent. The <Col N="1300" /> Government will not even recognise the extent of the crisis.</P>
    <P>This is because the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is a Progressive Democrat. It is a joke that a Minister of State who is a member of a party which favours the <i>laissez-faire</i> approach and free marketeering was put in charge of housing. The hallmarks of the Government's approach have been obvious in the past 20 months and were also obvious in the debate. It believes fundamentally in the principle of non-intervention. It does not want to get involved in issues such as the prevention of gazumping, which my party has championed. It wants to leave it to the building industry to sort out. It believes legislators should not dirty their hands with that issue because it is too complicated and that the building industry should be allowed to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Government does not want to intervene in the issue of landlord registration. It is a disgrace that the number of registered landlords in the entire local authority system has decreased. Over 80 per cent of landlords have yet to register with their local authorities. The Government does not want to touch this issue because it might be trouble.</P>
    <P>The assessment which the Fine Gael Party produced last June showed the extent of the public housing problem. In an effort to help the Minister, I proposed that the assessment should include the period from last June to this March to get a better picture of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Minister did not want to get involved. Once again, it was a case of non-interventionist, Thatcherite policies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and the Government say the mortgage issue is the responsibility of the Central Bank. They are not concerned that young couples are mortgaged to the hilt. If there is a substantial increase in interest rates, the problem of negative equity which occurred in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s will arise in Ireland. This is another typical Thatcherite example.</P>
      <P>I do not know who wrote the Minister's speech which he put on the record last night and into which he did not put much thought. A housing commission was not the idea of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party or any other member of the Opposition. The suggestion was not made by politicians, rather by the Simon Community and Threshold, the voluntary organisations which the Minister patronised in his speech when he praised them for developing so many houses. However, when they put forward a concrete proposal for a housing commission which would consider the long-term strategy of a housing policy, the Minister could not even get it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night he asked what a housing commission would do. If the Minister read his post, he would know that on 1 December 1998 the bodies I mentioned which are working in the voluntary sector <Col N="1301" /> sent him the suggested aims, functions, structure and composition of a housing commission. We only amplified what those bodies asked us to do. However, the Minister's response was a patronising remark that it was a wishy-washy idea and the matter should be left to the Government.</P>

      <P>The view is that the public service PLC will sort it out and there is no need to listen to the Simon Community or Threshold.</P>
      <P>Another aberration which emerged in the Minister's contribution related to the Government's commitment to social housing programmes. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, could tell his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, if he sees him later that there is a massive increase in house building programmes every time there is a Fine Gael led Government. However, every time the Progressive Democrats get their hands on the tiller of power, there is a massive increase in the number of applicants for local authority housing. Our record is clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined what he is doing in terms of the social housing programme. He outlined what would be spent and said that there would be almost 5,000 house starts this year. However, the scale of the problem in 1997, 1998 and 1999 is considerably worse than it was in 1994 or 1995.</P>

This puts huge pressure on the housing list. I asked the Minister for Finance the percentage of money which will go towards social housing and the capital programme. He told me that 7 per cent of the total spend on capital projects will go towards the provision of local authority housing. It is less than it was last year and it is substantially less than it was when my party was in Government with the Labour Party and Democratic Left. When the Fine Gael Party was in Government, 9 per cent of the total capital spend went towards the provision of local authority and social housing for low income people. When this Government got its hands on the tiller of power, the figure decreased to 7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Defence for taking this matter tonight. I, in common with thousands of other people who have a deep appreciation of the role the Defence Forces play in this State, was shocked to read the front page story in a newspaper yesterday regarding the Department of Finance submission to the White Paper on Defence.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance memorandum was obviously drawn up by someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. It proposed the axing of more than 3,500 jobs in the Defence Forces, the reduction in the number of brigades from the current three to one and the amalgamation of the Air Corps and the Naval Service. This proposal is nothing short of an attack on the integrity and standing of the Defence Forces. Not only am I appalled at the reported content of the memorandum, I am appalled such a document could be leaked to the press. Now that the Department of Finance proposals are in the public domain, there is an urgent need for the Minister for Defence to make a statement on the status of the memorandum and to give a clear indication of his views on its contents. That is why I sought this Adjournment debate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past 18 months have been an extremely turbulent time for our Defence Forces. The Minister's handling of Army deafness claims, the delay in the publication of a White Paper on Defence and the closure of Army barracks have all combined to undermine morale in the Defence Force. Now we have a leaked memorandum from the Department of Finance which proposes savage cutbacks in terms of both the structure and the numbers serving in the Defence Forces. These proposals must be rejected by the Minister for Defence and he should do so publicly before the House this evening. As Minister for Defence, he has a duty to protect and support the members of <Col N="1307" /> the Defence Forces who have served the State so proudly. He cannot stand idly by and allow this destructive proposal to gain currency.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of reform of the Defence Forces. We are entering an exciting phase in the development and transformation of the Defence Forces. For instance, the ongoing debate regarding our role in the developing common foreign and security policy of the European Union and the important task facing our Naval Service in tackling drug importation are two examples of the challenges that face us in this House as framers of defence policy. Meeting these challenges will require innovation and imagination and I look forward to seeing how the White Paper addresses these issues. However, I am sure slashing the numbers serving in the Defence Forces by roughly one third and amalgamating the Air Corps and the Naval Service has no role in meeting the future challenges. I hope the Minister will concur with my sentiments this evening.</P>
    <P>As I stated before, morale in the Defence Forces, the Army in particular, has been severely undermined in recent times. In the past 24 hours I have spoken with a number of serving members of the Defence Forces who believe that the Department of Finance is using the current controversy regarding Army deafness to drum up support for a radical downsizing of the Defence Forces. The lone voice holding out against these developments is the Minister and I urge him to consider his position. The Army deafness saga continues to gnaw away at the integrity and morale of the Defence Forces. It is time the Minister realised his strategy to date has failed. He needs to examine new methods of resolving the issue to the satisfaction of all sides. If the Minister fails to accept this argument, he will leave the Defence Forces exposed to the penny-pinching proposals such as those put forward by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Wall, for sharing his time and support what he said. Not so long ago we asked Price Waterhouse to undertake a major study of the Defence Forces and its requirements. It presented a report to the Government which it more or less accepted. No one more than members of the Defence Forces realises the necessity to reorganise and bring about a more efficient force, one which is more in touch and in keeping with modern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past two years we have seen major changes take place with the closure of barracks and reorganisation. We all accept that could not happen without causing pain. That has been evident in Kildare, particularly the Curragh, more so than anywhere else. Although the closure of barracks was necessary, it brought with it certain difficulties for a number of members, particularly in the Curragh. The soldiers who I meet are unhappy with the way this reorganisation is taking place, although there are a number of positive aspects with which they are happy. It is, however, <Col N="1308" /> causing much concern among many soldiers. Morale among many members of the Defence Forces is low and they are unsure about what exactly is happening. Will the Minister outline to members of the Defence Forces where their future lies? It is the least they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and thank the Minister for coming to respond to the debate. I ask him to make an immediate statement as to whether the Government agrees with proposals to reduce the Defence Forces to one amalgamated brigade. I find the Minister's reluctance to make a comment on this issue very surprising. It is his duty as Minister for Defence to comment on these proposals given their very drastic nature and given that he, as Minister, is presiding over a reorganisation which has outlined a particular process &ndash; there are agreed goals and numbers. This memorandum from the Department of Finance totally challenges that, and it is a key Department. The Minister has a duty to outline his beliefs and response to this memorandum.</P>
      <P>A three brigade structure was recently agreed. Indeed, we recently passed legislation supporting the reorganisation of the Defence Forces. The figure of 11,500 for the three arms of the Defence Forces has only recently been agreed and reorganisation has proceeded on that basis. This followed a detailed analysis of the Defence Forces over many years. Many members of the Defence Forces believe they are the most analysed and researched group in the country. It is time for action in getting on with the reorganisation rather than upsetting settled policy once again. As my colleague, Deputy Dukes, said yesterday, there is a settled policy in this area and why should we begin to undermine it again, given all the work that has gone into arriving at that policy?</P>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's recent comments about Partnership for Peace, in which he gave clear support for Ireland's participation in the future, it seems ludicrous to put forward proposals at this time that would effectively scale down the Defence Forces, so much so that we could not participate effectively in international peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>Compounding the problem, and I support what Deputy Wall said, is the fact that the Government has no current strategy to take compensation claims out of the courts and the constant commentary in the newspapers has led to poor morale and negative publicity. The Defence Forces have become an easy target for ridicule and for cutbacks by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The White Paper due later this year should not be used to further undermine the Defence Forces but to chart a positive course for the future. I do not accept the Minister's argument that he cannot comment on one submission out of 41. The principles involved are too important and he can comment in a general way on those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This memo is devastating to a force that is already subject to enormous scrutiny and numer<Col N="1309" /> ous reports and which is attempting to adjust to the three brigade structure. The Tánaiste is in Japan lobbying for Ireland to have a seat on the Security Council. How can we be on the Security Council when we do not have any resources to assist a Security Council decision? How can we go on basking in UN praise if we do not have the resources to support the UN? Why order 41 armoured personnel carriers if this undermining is being contemplated?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a statement on the Department of Finance proposals. I forgot to say that I would like to share time with Deputy Timmins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for affording me the opportunity to speak on this important topic. When the Minister was appointed to his present position almost a year and a half ago, he spoke about being the only person who had the courage to address the ills afflicting the Defence Forces. He portrayed himself as the cool clean hero, the modern day sheriff coming to clean up town, but what has he achieved? By endeavouring to whip up public support for his self-styled crusade he has opened the floodgates of the Army deafness claims as he antagonised serving and forming members into striking back. The Department of Defence appears to have no clear plan of action. All other parties have looked to the Minister to take this matter out of the courts system but it remains there. The Government is now at odds with itself. When I raised the issue of the Department of Finance view towards the agreed strength of 11,500 with respect to the White Paper in this House on 1 October last, the Minister told me that was the position. When was this memo drawn up? When did the Minister become aware of it? It gives me no pleasure to say I do not believe the Minister will be riding off into the sunset but rather heading to a plot on Boot Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contained a commitment to publish the first ever White Paper on Defence. Because it is a first, considerable emphasis is being placed on maximising the opportunities it presents to address defence issues in a positive and developmental way. The White Paper will make a significant contribution to defence in this country and will set out a clear strategy on defence for the next ten years and more.</P>
      <P>The question of having a White Paper on Defence is nothing new. It was recommended by Price Waterhouse in its report on the Defence Forces in 1994. The previous Government ignored this recommendation and, as usual, it took this Government to initiate the necessary steps to undertake what we consider an important and necessary task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a recognition that a White Paper on Defence will ensure the required policy framework to build on the changes made and take <Col N="1310" /> cognisance of the changing security environment. The White Paper is a great opportunity, which we propose to take, to ensure that there will be a long-term strategy in place for the development of defence. The planning work for the White Paper is proceeding. The process itself provides a vehicle to ensure the input of all of the stakeholders.</P>
    <P>When the Government's proposals were published, I announced a consultative process. I made it clear that as this would be the first White Paper on Defence, I wanted to ensure that all interested parties had an opportunity to make their input and put their views forward. I have received some 40 submissions so far. These include submissions from a variety of organisations covering the full spectrum of defence issues. All of these views are welcome. I am told that some submissions support an expansion of the Defence Forces while others adopt different lines. They give a good insight into the views of those who have an interest in defence or who are part of the defence organisation.</P>
    <P>As we are in the early stages of a deliberative process, it is not appropriate for me to publish or comment on the specifics of any one submission. There is no point in putting the cart before the horse &ndash; what is the point of having a consultative process and inviting submissions if we are not going to let the process run its course? I am aware there has been criticism of a submission from the Department of Finance. However, I do not intend intruding in the consultative process.</P>
    <P>It is important to respect the right of all interested organisations to have their input and for this to be considered carefully. All organisations who made a submission, including the representative associations, would want that to be the case. This must be respected, as should the fact that all submissions are presumably only submitted after careful consideration of all the issues by those making submissions.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the White Paper process is not interfering with the many positive changes currently taking place in the Defence Forces. Legislation has been enacted to give effect to a new top management structure in the Defence Forces. A system of regular recruitment is now in place, the recruitment campaign for this year will be announced shortly. This continuous recruitment is already feeding into the Defence Forces ability to conduct more collective training and in meeting overseas and other operational commitments.</P>
    <P>This year sees the allocation of pay savings to new equipment &ndash; the competition for the provision of new armoured personnel carriers for the Army is well advanced and the delivery of the first APCs will be made before the end of the year. Sixty per cent of the proceeds of the sale of six barracks will be applied to the improvement of Defence Forces infrastructure and equipment. A new ship for the Naval Service will be delivered next September and planning work is well <Col N="1311" /> under way to give effect to the special reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence will continue this developmental work. It will ensure that the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are organised and equipped to carry out their assigned roles in the domestic and overseas environments and it will shape an organisation the men and women of the Defence Forces will be proud to serve in.</P>
    <P>Ireland has participated extensively in peacekeeping for the past 40 years. Since the start of Ireland's UN involvement in 1958, more than 45,000 individual missions have been recorded. There is currently a total of 749 Irish military personnel serving abroad. Seven hundred and fourteen of those are serving with UN missions. Among this number is Ireland's contribution to SFOR, the NATO-led stabilisation force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the provision of some 50 personnel, mainly military police. This mission operates under a United Nations Security Council mandate. In addition to the aforementioned, there are 27 personnel seconded to APSO to assist in the relief effort in Honduras following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to build on a long tradition of service to the founding principles of the UN by making practical commitments of personnel on a continuing basis &ndash; proportionately, far beyond its size. Defence Forces participation in peacekeeping missions involves major operational taskings and a heavy financial commitment. It is my policy to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to continue in this important role of peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of participating in Partnership for Peace, Deputies will be aware that the House approved a motion on 28 January 1999 undertaking to further examine favourably Ireland's participation in PfP. During that debate, Deputies will recall that the Taoiseach stated that he would envisage, all going well, that Ireland will join Partnership for Peace on a mutually agreed basis in the second half of this year, and the Government will be working towards that timetable. He sees the current debate of PfP as allowing an opportunity to the different parties in Dáil Éireann to formulate their positions and to put them before the people as part of the European election platforms.</P>
    <P>I reject some of the allegations that were made, particularly by Deputy Timmins, on the question of escalating claims for deafness on my assumption of office. The Deputy knows well that the vast bulk of the claims were already made before I was appointed. He knows also that the decisions by the courts since then have brought about a marked reduction in the quantum, saving hundreds of millions of pounds to the taxpayer. The Deputy also knows I am anxious to establish an alternative system as soon as I get the quantum down to an affordable level for minor disabilities. The Deputy knows this is the truth. He came into this House to mislead the public. He has been <Col N="1312" /> through the system, he knows what it is like but he will not get away with trying to distort the facts.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy Power is concerned, I am anxious to ensure the development of the Curragh, a major expansion programme and that investment is made in that facility. I want it to be a masterpiece for the Defence Forces. All of the moneys have been provided for the swimming pool and refurbishment work. We will look at any other difficulties as they arise. We will not comment on one of 40 submissions. The Department of Finance has repeatedly produced such proposals. It will be my business to develop a Permanent Defence Force which is developmental and progressive, continues recruitment, which has better equipment and serves in the United Nations. That is what I intend to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Children's Hospital, when based in Harcourt Street, Dublin, was a tertiary centre for the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric leukaemia. At the time of the transfer of the hospital to Tallaght, it was understood that this specialist service provided by it would be maintained and developed in the wonderful new unit provided in Tallaght Hospital. In June last there was a smooth transition from Harcourt Street to Tallaght, and there are currently 40 children suffering from leukaemia being treated in Tallaght Hospital. The new unit in Tallaght was built at considerable public expense and, like its predecessor in Harcourt Street, is a tertiary unit providing diagnostic and treatment services not only for children living within the specific catchment area of the hospital but also for many living outside it.</P>
      <P>The parents of children currently in receipt of treatment in Tallaght and the hospital staff with specialist expertise in this area have been greatly concerned by reports that the paediatric haematology unit in Tallaght is to be closed down and transferred to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. For some weeks meetings have been sought with the Minister for Health and Children by a group representing these parents calling itself CHILD, Children's Hospital in Leukaemia Drive. Until today the Minister had, in his usual insensitive and high-handed fashion, refused to meet them to discuss their concerns and worries.</P>
      <P>This week I sought from the Minister's Department the report of the National Cancer Forum on which it was understood the Minister had based his decision. I discovered there is no report as such but a letter of 12 November 1998 written by the chairperson of the National Cancer Forum, Mr. James J. Fennelly, to the Minister. In this letter the forum details deliberations it had undertaken and concluded that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> all paediatric oncology cases should be referred to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, for initial diagnostic work-up and treatment planning.</P>
    <P>The letter states that both solid tumours and acute leukaemias should be referred to Crumlin but that &ldquo;this does not mean that all cases would necessarily have to be treated there&rdquo;. The letter continues that, after diagnosis, &ldquo;treatment, including chemotherapy, could then be delivered in the child's most appropriate local hospital, on a clearly defined and agreed shared care basis, subject to proper supervision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter also states:</P>
    <P>there exists a high level of expertise in this area and the Forum recommends that the personnel involved in Paediatric Oncology would explore the potential of utilising their skills for optimum patient benefit. This would involve discussion between Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, with a view to seeking agreement on revised structuring of existing Consultant posts in order to permit access to the Paediatric Oncology Unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Consultants who have special training and expertise in Paediatric Oncology.</P>
    <P>The letter concludes stating that its author &ldquo;would be glad if [the Minister] would consider transmitting this view to the relevant agencies (including Hospitals and Consultants) who deal with childhood cancers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from this letter that, before any changes of any nature were put in place and before final decisions were made, the National Cancer Forum envisaged that detailed discussions would take place involving the consultants who specialise in paediatric leukaemia in each hospital and the hospitals themselves. Unfortunately, a medical body, when making recommendations of this nature, does not always focus on the additional need for consultation with patients or, in this instance, with the parents of children who are concerned that new arrangements could impact on the provision of essential treatment and ongoing care for their children.</P>
    <P>This letter was received by the Minister from the chairman of the National Cancer Forum at a time when other issues concerning Tallaght Hospital were under the public spotlight and a cause for controversy. In the period November-December 1998 matters concerning Tallaght Hospital and its medical services were the subject of both Dáil debate and questions. For reasons unexplained, the Minister did not give any indication in the Dáil that consideration was being given to the downgrading of the paediatric haematology unit at Tallaght or its transfer to Crumlin, or to changing the procedures in the context of initial investigation of the possibility of leukaemia. I understand that, only two weeks ago, <Col N="1314" /> the Minister wrote to Tallaght and Crumlin hospitals and that the discussions recommended in the letter of 12 November 1998 have yet to commence.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain his delay of over two months in communicating with the hospitals concerned. He should also explain to the House his reasons for refusing until today to meet the concerned parents or to issue a detailed public statement as to the Department's policy in this context. He should also clarify, as it is a matter of concern to parents, whether Crumlin, like Tallaght, is currently participating in international paediatric leukaemia trials which ensure the most recent advances in the treatment of leukaemia are available and immediately communicated to both hospitals.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister has dealt with this matter has caused unnecessary alarm to already stressed parents of children undergoing critical treatment in Tallaght Hospital, has upset parents of children undergoing similar treatment in Crumlin Hospital, and has distressed both medical and nursing staff in Tallaght and Crumlin hospitals who are, on a daily basis, providing excellent care for children suffering from leukaemia. It is time the Minister for Health and Children realised a patient-centred approach is required in the job to which he has been appointed. It is long since past the time for him to understand that people expect to be treated with decency and insight.</P>
    <P>I understand that, subsequent to my seeking this Adjournment debate yesterday, the Minister finally agreed to meet the concerned parents. I am glad he has done so and I understand the meeting is to take place tomorrow morning. I do not believe these parents, already under pressure and strain and greatly concerned for the health of their children, should, in the circumstances in which they find themselves, have been compelled by the Minister's attitude to publicly campaign to meet with him. He should, for once, have put patients first and agreed to their request for a meeting without the necessity for the publicity they have been forced to seek and the campaign they have been forced to launch. I hope, when the Minister meets with the parents tomorrow, he will be able to ease their concerns, that the issue of the future of paediatric leukaemia care and diagnosis will be discussed in comprehensive detail and that final decisions will not be made without consultation with parents, between the hospitals and between the consultants involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to correct serious inaccuracies which have arisen in relation to this issue over the past few days. There is no question, nor was any proposal put to me, of transferring the haematology unit at Tallaght Hospital to Crumlin. Contrary to some completely inaccurate media reports, I have no intention of closing the unit at Tallaght. No proposal <Col N="1315" /> in this regard was ever made to me nor have I ever considered this step. It simply does not arise.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify the situation. The only change to current paediatric oncology and haematology services will be that, in future, children diagnosed with cancer will be referred for an initial assessment to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. This does not mean that all cases will be treated in Crumlin or that the unit at Tallaght will no longer treat them. Instead, the initial assessment of newly diagnosed cases, including their diagnostic work-up and the planning of their treatment, will take place at Crumlin. Children will then continue to be treated, as now, either in Tallaght or at other centres which deal with such cases, these being Crumlin, Mercy Hospital, Cork, and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The change in assessment policy is as a result of a recommendation by an expert body on cancer services, the National Cancer Forum. The forum, which was appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, advises me, as Minister, on, among other things, best practice in relation to cancer treatments. The sole focus of its recommendation is improved patient care. If Deputy Shatter is accusing me of not having a patient focus, he levels the same criticism against the National Cancer Forum because I have accepted its recommendations in full. Clearly there is no basis for that attack. The forum comprises some of the most eminent cancer specialists, including in the areas of oncology, haematology, cancer surgery, cancer nursing and a range of other specialties. Deputy Monica Barnes is an esteemed member of the forum. The forum is entirely separate from, and completely independent of, the Department of Health and Children. It has no axe to grind in relation to this or any other issue on which it has offered its expert advice.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that, in examining this issue, the National Cancer Forum's major and paramount concern was to identify how best to provide a high quality service for children, from the time a child is initially diagnosed, right through to all appropriate forms of treatment. It took account of expert international evidence that because of the need for a minimum throughput of patients to ensure high quality, there should be only one specialist paediatric oncology unit per five million population. The forum also noted international evidence that a specialist paediatric cancer unit should have the appropriate infrastructure of services, personnel and equipment to provide the optimum level of service to children, and that the treatment of solid tumours, which is currently carried out in Crumlin, should not be separated from the treatment of children with leukaemia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances and with a vital emphasis on quality of care, the forum recommended to me that all paediatric oncology cases should be referred to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Crumlin for initial diagnostic work-up and treatment planning. The forum indicated that this recommendation does not mean all cases would <Col N="1316" /> have to be treated in Crumlin. It indicated that subsequent treatment, including chemotherapy, could then be delivered in the child's most appropriate local hospital, on a clearly defined and agreed share-care basis, subject to proper supervision.</P>
    <P>I accepted this decision and the Department notified the hospitals involved. In doing so, the Department stressed the need for close working relationships between all hospitals treating children with cancer. In recent months the three Dublin children's hospitals have agreed to put in place a mechanism for joint decision-making on major policy issues relating to the provision of acute hospital services for children. I have strongly welcomed this development. I see it as a means of facilitating the continuing provision of high quality services for children.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to meet tomorrow the organisation CHILD, which was formally launched last Monday. I will be accompanied by the chairperson of the National Cancer Forum to deal with its queries.</P>
    <P>There is no question of closing or transferring the paediatric haematology unit at Tallaght, nor was there ever any question of doing so. The Deputy had better ask those who promulgated that myth the basis of their proposals since they have no foundation in reality. I am committed to the continuing provision of high quality cancer treatment services for children. I am confident the new arrangements for assessing newly diagnosed cases will be to the benefit of children, who are at the centre of these services.</P>
    <P>No distress should be imposed on parents or patients who have this problem. The Deputy had better check with those who made statements. I made a public statement and explained the basis of the decision. The criticisms that have emanated &ndash; certain things have been said at press conferences, obviously from a position of ignorance &ndash; which suggest that in some way I made a political decision, are without foundation. These are medical decisions based on expert medical evidence, provided by a forum appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, which is doing excellent work. His legacy from his tenure in the Department of Health is the national cancer strategy, an important initiative which results in better cancer services than in the past and which I support. I ask Opposition Deputies to inform themselves before trying to play the type of game played in the past few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for coming in to address this problem. This is the third time I have had to raise this matter on the <Col N="1317" /> Adjournment in the past six months. On the Order of Business, including yesterday, I raised it at least five times with the Taoiseach. It is becoming extremely exasperating for my northside constituents that this horrendous problem continues to plague our streets.</P>
      <P>The Christmas and new year period in Dublin North-East and in many parts of Dublin North-Central were marked by a continuing upsurge in the menace of joyriding. Virtually every day, sometimes in the middle of the day, a number of these criminals caused terror and threatened the lives of residents in Coolock, Ayrfield, Donaghmede, Raheny and Kilbarrack. Whether through a lack of Garda resources or support from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the judicial system, or simply a lack of will on behalf of the Minister, the problem continues to exasperate and endanger the lives of my constituents.</P>
      <P>In one six-day period, from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, four of my acquaintances on organisations with which I am involved had their cars wrecked, stolen or burned out. I speak from experience given that I was the victim of an attempted car theft on New Year's Eve. It is critical that the Minister acts before another of my constituents is seriously injured or killed by the thugs responsible for joyriding.</P>
      <P>A number of tragic fatalities have been caused by these criminals in Dublin's northside in recent years. In 1998 three deaths were caused by similar criminals in Cork city. Since early last year I have asked the Taoiseach on at least five occasions on the Order of Business to take action. I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach to implement the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which I understand empowers the Garda to stop any car where it considers the driver is uninsured or under age. If that Act is not sufficiently effective, the Minister should amend it or introduce a new Bill to outlaw joyriding and associated car theft by imposing severe custodial sentences on the perpetrators. I am willing to draft the legislation if necessary and to ask for the Minister's support to put it through.</P>
      <P>This type of crime and associated civil disorder would not be tolerated for one instant in the leafy middle class suburbs of Dublin's southside or of Cork's southside or many rural areas. My constituents and I want to know why it is, seemingly, tolerated in more deprived areas, particularly in my constituency. Why do the J and R districts of the Garda Síochána not seal off the areas affected? In the case of north Coolock it would simply mean sealing the Priorswood Road at both ends to prevent joyriding cars getting into these areas. I ask the Minister not to allow no-go areas to spring up again, as happened under some of his predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the gardaí in Dublin North-East, under superintendents Flynn and Long, are working hard at the problem but they are seriously under-resourced. There are fewer than 200 gardaí to police well over 90,000 people, which is extraordinary when compared with similar areas such as Limerick city. It is the Minister's responsibility <Col N="1318" /> to provide Garda resources. I urgently request him to transfer at least 60 extra gardaí to the Coolock, Raheny and Howth stations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have huge responsibilities in regard to the underprovision of resources to combat the social problems which produce joyriding and major crimes. As a member of Dublin City Council I called for the implementation of major changes in traffic calming at Glin Road, St. Donagh's Road, Newbrook Road, Swan's Nest Road and the other main thoroughfares which these criminals use to terrorise my constituents at night. Public representatives such as myself and the Minister's colleague, Deputy Woods, the Dublin City Manager and Commissioner McHugh, who once looked after the area, should be called to a meeting with a view to supporting communities to root out this problem. I realise there are underlying social problems and that the Government has made some efforts such as support for the village centre at Darndale, Belcamp parish. Sometimes we get exasperated, for example, at the announcement for youth and sports grants when communities are required to come up with 5, 10, 20 or 30 per cent of the available moneys. We are talking about poorly resourced communities.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Dublin northside, will the Minister take the necessary measures to stop this crime once and for all, provide extra Garda resources and bring together the social partners, under the commissioner, to look at radical ways to solve this problem? The commissioner will have confirmed that my constituency is the worst area in the country for this problem. Perhaps it was endemic in the area many years ago and that some of the people associated with it came out of prison. We do not want any more deaths on our streets. We want the problem solved once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to set out the Garda response to the anti-social criminal activity known as joy-riding. The problem of joy-riding is an example of the disorderly and unruly activities of a small minority of young people, most of whom come from backgrounds which may have disadvantages of various kinds. This is not to say that disadvantage excuses this anti-social behaviour, but it does highlight the need for an inter-agency approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Garda is concerned, I assure the House that it has the power and resources to deal with the problem. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the following measures have been taken by them. Higher visibility special patrols in several areas of Dublin's north side have been undertaken and they have prepared suitable plans to deal with incidents of joy-riding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vehicle stopping device known as the stinger is in use. This device is not automatically <Col N="1319" /> used in every case of joy-riding. The safety of the general public is the primary concern. An assessment must be made in each instance by a senior ranking Garda as to whether it is safe to use the stinger in a given circumstance. With regard to the area referred to by the Deputy, a number of gardaí have received instruction in the use and operation of stinger and this equipment has been used on suitable occasions. Use is being made of section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which allows the Garda to stop and seize vehicles it believes to be driven by drivers who by reason of their age are ineligible to hold a driving licence.</P>
    <P>Gardaí have met with Dublin Corporation and as a result additional vehicle restriction measures have been introduced in the Darndale area. Gardaí have also met with residents' groups and Dublin Corporation with a view to extending traffic calming measures to the Glin area. The Garda air support unit has been used successfully in a number of cases involving unauthorised taking of vehicles. In its ongoing campaign against joy-riding, the Garda is deeply conscious of the need to secure the support of the public in the worst affected areas. This is why, as well as apprehending offenders, the Garda will continue to meet with community groups who are concerned about the activities of unruly groups.</P>
    <P>I support and fund programmes, generally referred to as youth diversion schemes, which are community based and which are designed to draw young people away from crime, including joy-riding. The schemes operate in the following areas in Dublin's north side: Darndale, north inner city, Hardwicke Street, Phoenix Park area and Ballymun. Through the combined efforts of local agencies, these projects aim at identifying the young people at risk and assessing intervention programmes to service their needs; promoting productive and creative use of the target groups leisure time with a view to enabling their integration into mainstream youth activity groups; and liaising closely with parents, schools, other agencies and the community in general. The programmes are aimed predominantly at young people and involve various activities, sporting, counselling, informal group work, education, group/family and after care programmes, anti-vandalism and pro-environment programmes and other activities deemed appropriate. As I stated earlier, these projects are designed to prevent crime, to deter young people from becoming involved in criminal <Col N="1320" /> or anti-social behaviour and to improve the quality of life for young people.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Garda will not let up in its continuing campaign against joy-riding and will continue to work with the local community, local authorities and State services so that all possible steps are taken to deter such behaviour.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle is a serious criminal offence. With regard to the possibility of Assistant Commissioner McHugh meeting a number of local Deputies to discuss this problem, which Deputy Broughan stated was on the increase again, that is something to which I personally would be amenable. I will certainly ask the Assistant Commissioner if he will be prepared to facilitate such a meeting in order that the issue may be discussed.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach, to whom he referred, has discussed this particular problem with me on a number of occasions and that he, too, is concerned about it.</P>
    <P>The number of gardaí in the force when I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the region of 10,700. It has now risen to over 11,200. The Government is determined during its period of office to increase the number in the force to the maximum allowed by regulation, which is 12,000. That obviously would allow for some flexibility in relation to the placement of gardaí, in this instance in Dublin's north side.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a most ambitious prison building programme under way and there should be an additional 1,000 places in the system by the end of this year. The Government is committed to practically doubling the number of prison spaces during its term of office. That should have an effect on crime levels and the crime of joy-riding.</P>
    <P>However, in the final analysis I do not think the Deputy would pretend &ndash; I certainly will not &ndash; that the be all and end all of everything is the criminal justice system. The need for an inter-agency approach to this problem in disadvantaged areas is one which has been expounded on numerous occasions. I assure the Deputy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will do its utmost to try to resolve the difficulty in so far as it is in a position to do so. The co-operation of all agencies should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.46 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 February 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Action Plan on Implementing the Information Society has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. It presents a framework which identifies a wide range of measures considered necessary or desirable in order to implement the information society in Ireland. While responsibility for each of the action points typically rests with one or more Ministers, Departments or agencies, the work on any one action point could have a significant bearing on other action points in the plan.</P>
      <P>The plan sets out action points under a number of headings. The first of these is telecommunications infrastructure. We made important progress in this area during 1998, with full liberalisation of the market from 1 December 1998, 13 months ahead of schedule. The plan envisages further progress during 1999, mainly under the auspices of the Minister for Public Enterprise, including the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, the sale of Cablelink, and work on upgrading our international connectivity and on extending broadband services.</P>
      <P>The plan also contains measures on the development of electronic commerce and business opportunities. In particular, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the industrial development agencies will produce an action programme in this important area shortly.</P>
      <P>Under the heading enabling measures, the plan deals with issues such as providing access to the Internet in public places, such as public libraries, for people who do not have access from their homes or workplaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we move more and more to electronic commerce, there will be greater need for services such as digital certificates to enable people to communicate securely and with certainty over the Internet. The Department of Public Enterprise will work to identify suitable operators in this <Col N="1322" /> activity and to put the necessary legal framework in place.</P>
    <P>Implementing the information society will also require legislative changes in a number of areas, under the responsibility of a number of Ministers. These include the area of digital certificates which I have just mentioned, admissability of electronic evidence in court proceedings, data protection, the Telecom Éireann initial public offering, and preparing for digital TV.</P>
    <P>A large part of the action plan concerns information and communication technologies and the delivery of public services. It covers provision of information using modern technologies such as the Internet and electronic mail, and re-affirms the Government's commitment to greater use of these technologies in the mainstream of public administration. It also envisages a range of projects to provide public services electronically from a number of Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>The plan also states that a detailed examination of deeper integration of public services, sometimes referred to as re-engineering or re-inventing Government, will be carried out during 1999.</P>
    <P>Topics such as raising awareness and education are covered in a section headed support areas where action is needed. For example, the Information Society Commission, in conjunction with IBEC, is implementing a major campaign aimed at raising awareness of information society issues amongst small and medium enterprises.</P>
    <P>Finally, a section headed taking the work forward envisages that an inter-departmental group, supported by a policy development team, will monitor implementation of the action plan. In addition, the plan provides for further assessment of overall resource requirements in order to ensure satisfactory implementation of all aspects of the plan.</P>
    <P>I trust I have given Deputies a feel for the contents and objectives of the plan.  In agreeing the plan at Government, I have asked each Minister to take a close personal interest in ensuring that any aspects of the plan which concern his or her area of responsibility are delivered as part of an overall strategy to ensure that Ireland is truly a &ldquo;digital age&rdquo; country.</P>
    <P>Many reports have emerged in recent months which contain recommendations on how this should happen. I believe that the action plan will help to translate those recommendations into concrete progress.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the SMI Programme of Action on Information Technology, the Deputy is aware from my reply of 16 December that a number of the recommendations contained in the SMI working group report on information technology were taken up in the work of the inter-departmental implementation group on the information society. It was the work of this group which led to adoption of the action plan which I have just been describing, so it is fair to expect that implementation of that plan should result in <Col N="1323" /> progress being made on a number of the issues identified in the SMI working group report.</P>
    <P>The SMI working group report contains a number of recommendations in relation to the acquisition and retention of skilled IT staff. In December 1998 the Department of Finance reached agreement with the unions on a set of once-off exceptional measures to retain skilled IT staff engaged in Year 2000 work until that work is completed. This includes scope for re-assignment of suitable administrative staff to IT work and, where it is deemed appropriate payment of a loyalty bonus in April 2000 to skilled IT staff. Four IT officers in my Department who are working on the Year 2000 issue will qualify for special bonus payments.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations of the report including those relating to staffing issues, will shortly be considered by the SMI implementation group in the context of completing the SMI Programme of Action on Information Technology. I expect that a report will be submitted to Government at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to the House on 30 September 1998 a Partnership 2000 working group on basic income has been set up under the aegis of my Department. The group has commissioned a study which is being carried out in two phases. The overall purpose of the study is to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system. Draft reports from the consultants on the first phase of the study, which examines the costs and distribution analysis of a basic income, were received, as expected, at the end of October.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the methodologies involved in costing and analysing the distributional effects of a basic income are both complex and time consuming. The research team comprising the ESRI and Professor Charles Clark of St. John's University, New York, have been engaged in reconciling a number of issues which are fundamental to the conclusions. The working group on basic income has been providing information and assistance to the consultancy team in recent weeks in addressing costings, taxation and the other issues involved.</P>
      <P>As a result, the first phase is being finalised, incorporating material now available in respect of the 1998 out-turn on relevant variables, and will be presented to a meeting of the working group in February. The second phase of the study, which will consider the dynamic effects of basic income, will then move ahead rapidly.</P>
      <P>Progress on the study was reported to the social partners at their quarterly meeting last week.</P>
      <P>The study and the report of the Partnership 2000 working group will enable the Government to examine the matter. It is intended that a Green Paper will be published, as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium. As the two phases of the study constitute an important input into the preparation of the Green Paper, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the precise date of publication.</P>

    <P>The Irish Statute Book, containing Acts of the Oireachtas from 1922 to 1997, in CD-ROM format went on sale on 17 December 1998. One hundred <Col N="1326" /> copies were released through the Government Publications Sales Office. The Statute Book was simultaneously made available on the Internet.</P>
    <P>A further 500 copies were produced last month. Three hundred and forty went on sale last week. Another 800 copies have been ordered and are expected to be received by 15 February. The Incorporated Law Society has placed a separate order for 2,000 CDs and these will be received next week. The total cost of the contract to make the Statute Book available in electronic form is £825,000.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the next phase of Irish Statutes in CD-ROM format will be available in May. This CD-ROM will include the Acts of the Oireachtas, statutory instruments and the chronological tables of the statutes from 1922 to 1998.</P>
    <P>The agreed contract price provides for a further 400 CDs in the second phase of the project. The Office of the Attorney General is currently discussing the cost of obtaining additional CDs. The material will also be available on the Internet.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Council, appointed in November 1998, has been meeting on a monthly basis since then. At the request of the Government, the main work of the council during 1999 will relate to the preparation of a new strategy report to provide a basis for a national agreement in succession to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>Also, the NESC secretariat will continue to work on a study benchmarking Irish progress in the areas covered by the Partnership 2000 agreement both over time and by comparison with other countries. The subject matter includes work on education, taxation and child care. Some of the material in the benchmarking exercise will be drawn upon for the strategic review. It is intended that the results of the research will be published later in 1999.</P>
      <P>A short report on profitability in the Irish economy and associated policy issues is also in preparation. The report is due to be considered by the council in the spring.</P>
      <P>The NESC secretariat is also preparing a study of housing in Ireland. Its objectives are to provide an overview and assessment of the situation in the main housing sectors and to recommend a consistent set of policies designed to address the various problems in housing. The report will be published in 1999.</P>

      <P>The current staff in the media monitoring unit within the Government Information Services comprise a manager of the unit, two executive officers, one staff officer and three clerical officers. All of the staff with the exception of the manager and one clerical officer are on secondment from other Departments to work in the unit.</P>
      <P>The full year cost of the unit to my Department in 1998 was approximately £72,000. This covers the manager's salary, shift allowances paid to the other staff and other general administration costs. The salaries of the staff on secondment are paid by their parent Departments and my Department pays the shift allowance, amounting to one sixth of each officer's salary. There are also some overhead costs which are incurred by my Department such as office maintenance, heating and electricity costs. However, these costs cannot be identified separately.</P>
      <P>Staff in the unit operate a flexible rota of three different work shifts so that 18 hours per day they are able to provide a comprehensive information service to Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments and alert them to problems which may arise in relation to their implementation.</P>

      <P>I will meet the Danish Prime Minister on 4 February in Copenhagen and with President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin on 15 February in Paris. I will also meet with the Dutch Prime Minister on 17 February in the Hague. I view these meetings as extremely important opportunities to clarify Irish interests and concerns and ensure the best possible final outcome for Ireland in the Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
      <P>As to the content of my discussions, I would envisage that the primary focus will be the key issues under Agenda 2000. It would be unwise of me to announce in the House the finer details of our negotiating strategy on these matters before the negotiations proper begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to discuss in detail with Prime Minister Jospin and President Chirac, the current proposals on CAP reform. Our French counterparts like ourselves recognise the vital importance of the agriculture industry to our economies. As I have indicated to the House previously, while we accept the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals, the proposals as they stand would damage <Col N="1331" /> both our agriculture industry and the Irish economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I also intend discussing the retention of duty free sale facilities during the course of my visits. In this respect, both the French President and Prime Minister have been strong advocates for the retention of duty free sales beyond end of June.</P>
    <P>Apart from Agenda 2000 related matters, I would also expect to discuss issues of a bilateral nature and take the opportunity to brief each of the Leaders on the Northern Ireland peace process. I will also raise external issues, such as the crisis in Kosovo, which are of concern to the Union.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides quarterly and annual divorce statistics as classified by the Circuit Court Office to the Central Statistics Office. These statistics are a count of divorce applications and divorces granted. They do not, however, provide information on the social aspects of divorce sought by the CSO. The compilation of court statistics must have due regard for the confidentiality of family law cases and any arrangements to extend the scope of such statistics will have to fully respect such confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I have noted carefully the concerns of the National Statistics Board and I am in contact with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the improvement of divorce statistics in the context of the modernisation of the General Register Office and in the context of the establishment of the new Courts Service Board. Further consultation is envisaged in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>On assuming office, the Government, recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, decided that the most strategic way to tackle the problem of social exclusion was to re-constitute the Cabinet Committee on Drugs into a wider Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, which would address disadvantage in the broadest sense. I presume that the Deputy is seeking a report on progress in relation to the committee's work in responding to the drug problem.</P>
      <P>Following a recent independent evaluation of the drugs initiative, the Cabinet committee has agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces in the medium term, on the basis of an appropriate framework being put in place which would enable the initiative to be measured in terms of outcomes and impacts in due course. The evaluator, in finding that a number of significant successes had been achieved in the relatively short time since they were established, had recommended that the local drugs task forces should continue for a further two years, to see if the encouraging progress made to date can be translated into longer term, quantifiable and sustainable benefits on the ground.</P>
      <P>I am currently preparing detailed proposals on the future operation of the task forces &ndash; in the light of the findings and recommendations of the evaluator &ndash; and I will submit these to the Cabinet committee for consideration at an early date.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the task forces are continuing to implement their action plans, which contain nearly 230 separate measures under the themes of education, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and reducing local supply and for which the Government has allocated £10 million funding.</P>
      <P>Under a separate, complementary initiative, the Government last year set up a Young People's Facilities and Services Fund. The purpose of the fund is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the Exchequer contribution of £30 million committed to the fund over the period 1998-2000, <Col N="1333" /> to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects, £20 million is being targeted at the local drugs task force areas, details of which I have already supplied in response to Deputy Mitchell in Question No. 841 of 27 January 1999. Development groups &ndash; comprising representatives from the task forces, local authorities and vocational education committees &ndash; were set up in these areas and they have prepared integrated facilities and services plans. These plans are currently being assessed by an inter-agency committee, chaired by my Department, with a view to making recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the near future, regarding funding to implement them.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department is responsible for the care of many protected areas in the west, ranging from parks and gardens to national monuments. Although the overriding responsibility is that of conservation, the presentation of heritage sites to the public plays a key part in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were six heritage sites open to the public in 1980 in the western counties from Donegal to Kerry, and they attracted 202,000 fee paying visitors in that year. By 1998 the number of such sites open to the public had risen to 22 with visitors <Col N="1334" /> to these sites for the first nine months of 1998 amounting to some 754,000.</P>
    <P>Much of this increase is due to the considerable capital investment under the tourism operational programme supported by the EU. It also arises from the steady commitment and investment in the guide service at sites and associated promotion of them. For instance in 1999 over two million colour information leaflets have been produced corresponding to the regional tourism areas. The general leaflet, depicting all 62 heritage sites in Ireland, is in five languages and, at a recent meeting between my staff and the regional tourism managers the new leaflets were warmly welcomed. In addition to this my staff are involved in another initiative involving the promotion of heritage sites at trade fairs abroad and the development of a world wide web site on the heritage and cultural institutions. The web site, www.heritageireland.ie, has attracted considerable interest with 22,000 hits in its first two months.</P>
    <P>A key element in presenting heritage sites and playing a constructive role in sustainable tourism is to ensure quality service at sites. Market research indicates very high levels of visitor satisfaction at sites managed by Dúchas. For example, the most recent research indicated that 94 per cent of respondents found the guides to be professional or very professional. More intensive market research at sites is planned this year to ensure that these standards are maintained and improved upon.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 50 agus 64 le cheile.</P>
      <P>In general, numbers visiting sites managed by Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, are rising. In 1970, there were four sites attracting 132,000 visitors. This year, there will be 62 sites presented to the public and the projected number of visitors is 2.2 million.</P>
      <P>Céide Fields is one of these sites. When the visitor centre there first opened it attracted a rush of visitors, which is not unusual. As is often the case, numbers settled into a pattern in subsequent years. They have stabilised at 40,000 per annum since 1996, which is a very satisfactory performance. With new promotional activities I am confident that this performance will be maintained and improved upon.</P>
      <P>With regard to the facility now proposed for Mullaghmore, in October 1996 on behalf of the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the Commissioners of Public Works applied to Clare County Council for planning permission for an entry point consisting of limited visitor facilities at Mullaghmore, County Clare, comprising a covered waiting area, toilets, ranger accommodation, ancillary parking, storage area and signage. In July 1997 Clare County Council informed my Department that the application for planning permission constituted a material contravention of the county development plan. In these circumstances a 75 per cent majority vote of councillors at a formal meeting of Clare County Council was required for planning permission to be granted.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that at a meeting of Clare County Council on 15 September last such support was not forthcoming and accordingly planning permission was refused.</P>
      <P>On 13 October 1998 the Commissioners of Public Works on my behalf appealed that decision to An Bord Pleanála who will make their decision in due course.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will also be aware that I have decided to set up a consultative committee on the heritage of the Burren, which will identify opportunities for developments in keeping with the area's character as well as ensuring that there is a harmonious relationship with local communities in the development of the national park. Mr. Joe Moran, former chief executive of the ESB, who has extensive experience of economic and social issues at the highest level, has agreed to act as chairman of the committee.</P>

      <P>I am continuing the process of implementing an action plan to address the needs of our islands as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In 1998 I announced assistance of almost £3.9 million towards various capital works on islands. This programme of works is being carried out in partnership with local authorities.</P>
      <P>Access to the mainland was one of the main issues raised with me on the various occasions I met with island communities and their representatives. Since I was given responsibility for the offshore islands I have provided significant funding for access, including over £1.7 million for the inhabited islands off the coast of County Cork and, for the first time, ferry services to and from Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island have been subsidised. In addition, the announcement in the recent budget that new house grants on islands have been doubled is a major boost to islanders wishing to build new homes for themselves.</P>
      <P>Through the interdepartmental committee on the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, the implementation of Government policy on offshore islands is co-ordinated to ensure it is implemented in an effective manner. As chairman of this committee I will continue to endeavour to ensure equal access to services such as health, education, water, roads, electricity, refuse collection, etc., for our island communities. The provision of essential services and the promotion of economic and social development on the islands are vital in securing the future of our offshore islands.</P>
      <P>Numerous positive decisions have been made following discussions at the interdepartmental committee by various Government Departments in relation to the islands particularly in relation to matters affecting the Departments of Marine and Natural Resources, Education and Science, Public Enterprise and Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>I have succeeded in obtaining an increase of 30 per cent in funding for the offshore islands in 1999 and this additional funding will further assist me in continuing with the work which I have already outlined.</P>

      <P>There are three conditions attached to the licence which issued under section 26 (1)(ii) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, to the Ward Union Hunt Club. These conditions provide:</P>
      <P>(a) that deer may be hunted from 15 October 1998 to 31 March 1999;</P>
      <P>(b) that the club shall supply details of the number and sex of all deer released and not recaptured together with an indication of where such deer were last sighted, this information to be supplied as soon as possible after 31 March 1999; and</P>
      <P>(c) that I, as Minister, may appoint a person or persons to undertake the monitoring of the Ward Union Hunt Club and that the licensee will co-operate with such person or persons and will indemnify and keep indemnified me, as Minister, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to such monitoring.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of the hunt is carried out on an intermittent basis and I understand that there were no officers present from my own Department or from the Department of Agriculture and Food at the particular hunt referred to by Deputy Reynolds. I am not aware of any breach of the conditions attached to the licence.</P>
      <P>In accordance with views conveyed to me by the heritage council as part of its review of the issue of licences under the provisions of section 26 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, I have sought clarification from the Attorney General as to the legal status of the deer hunted by the Ward Union Hunt Club, whether they are wild or domesticated, or whether they constitute private property. I intend to address the matter further following receipt of the advice of the Attorney General and appropriate consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>Phase 1 of the Collins Barracks project at Clarke Square was opened to the public in September 1997. The next stages of development, which are ongoing, comprise the redevelopment of the existing buildings on the remainder of the site and the construction of a new building in the centre of the site.</P>
      <P>In the case of the development of the remainder of the existing buildings, work is now well advanced and should be completed for use by the Museum within the next 18 months.</P>
      <P>Plans prepared by the Office of Public Works for the development of the new building in the centre of the site are being finalised. It is intended that this new building will be the focus of the site and become the principal visitor services area. It will also provide additional spaces for exhibitions and will link to adjacent buildings on the site. It is hoped that the new building will be open to the public in 2003.</P>
      <P>A total sum of £29.85 million has been allocated to the Collins Barracks project which is being co-funded through the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999. Eighteen million pounds of this amount is represented by co-financed Structural Funds and matching Exchequer funds with an additional £11.85 million provided solely from the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to say that following a series of consultations over the last year with representatives of the farming organisations and turf cutters, I am now in a position to announce arrangements to deal with turf cutters <Col N="1348" /> in areas where my Department is obliged under the EU habitats directive to ensure turf cutting will cease in areas proposed for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs.</P>
      <P>Most damage to SACs is caused by industrial and commercial operations. Cutting for industrial and commercial purposes in these bogs must cease before the 1999 cutting season. In exceptional cases to protect employment, I may agree to allow cutting in 1999 where the operator has entered into a formal agreement with my Department that they will transfer operations to a non-SAC site next year and will cease operations within the SAC at an early date. Compensation will be assessed for these operations case by case and full compensation will be paid for proven actual losses.</P>
      <P>In the case of domestic cutters, it is clear that, despite the fact that there are many more users than industrial and commercial operators, the damage done to the bogs by an individual in a year is small in most situations. I am conscious of the social and economic impacts immediate cessation would have on small communities and have decided to make exceptional arrangements in the case of cutters for domestic use. Cutters will be given a period of up to ten years to make new arrangements. Those who opt to continue cutting will be allowed to do so on the basis of a permit from my Department, which will specify the amount of turf to be cut and the method of cutting to be used. Use of sausage machines will not be permitted. Use of other sod turf mechanical harvesting machines will generally be permitted. People who have been cutting for their own personal domestic use will be permitted to cut the amount of turf needed for their own use only for up to ten years in less sensitive areas of the bog.</P>
      <P>I will also be announcing an enhanced compensation package for cutters and will forward a copy of my announcement to the Deputy for his information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement provides for the establishment of a North-South Ministerial Council and at least six implementation bodies as part of the interlocking institutional arrangements which will be brought into being on the entry into force of the Agreement. Consideration is also to be given to a joint North-South parliamentary forum and an independent North-South consultative forum. It is likely, however, that this would occur after the establishment of the other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> It was envisaged that the North-South Ministerial Council would meet initially in shadow or transitional form, with two main purposes: (a) to consider its own future <i>modus operandi</i> and (b) to agree and identify the areas in which implementation bodies are to be established to implement on an all-island and cross-Border basis policies agreed in the Council, and at least six other areas for co-operation through existing bodies, North and South. However, given the failure so far to agree on the establishment of a Shadow Northern Ireland Executive, it has not been possible for the North-South Ministerial Council to meet in shadow form. Nevertheless, informal work has been under way between officials on the possible detailed procedures of the Council.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached on 18 December on areas for co-operation and implementation, including in regard to the identification of the six implementation bodies and six other matters for co-operation. This agreement was part of the interim report of the First and Deputy First Minister which was endorsed by the Assembly at its meeting on 18 January. The two Governments, accordingly, take the view that they can have sufficient confidence to proceed, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, with the necessary legislative and other arrangements required to establish the implementation bodies and to enable them to function as and from the entry into force of the Agreement as a whole. Intensive and detailed work is continuing at official level and in consultation with the Northern parties.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the bodies would be established by supplementary international agreement between the two Governments, and that the legislation required to enable them to operate in this jurisdiction would, probably, be introduced in the Oireachtas early next month, in parallel with the processing of the necessary Westminster legislation. The aim would be to permit the entry into force of the Agreement and, therefore, the establishment of all the institutions, including the implementation bodies, shortly afterwards, in accordance with the timetable envisaged. However, this timetable is, clearly, dependent on the resolution of the continuing political difficulties surrounding the creation of a Northern Ireland Executive.</P>

      <P>The Northern Ireland Assembly at its first meeting on 1 July 1998 elected David Trimble and Séamus Mallon as the designated First and Deputy First Ministers respectively. It was also agreed that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister would draw up a report on the number <Col N="1351" /> and demarcation of Government Departments envisaged for the new Northern Ireland Executive. General agreement on ten Government Departments and their responsibilities was reached on 18 December 1998. The Assembly approved the interim report of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on 18 January this year.</P>
      <P>It is expected that a final report will be put to the Assembly on 15 February for endorsement. When adopted, it will be necessary, before the shadow Executive can be created, for the Northern Ireland Secretary of State to issue the necessary Standing Orders for the d'Hondt system to be triggered. The latter, as stipulated in the British-Irish Agreement, is the system whereby seats on the Executive are allocated to parties in proportion to the number of seats they hold in the Assembly. The Secretary of State has identified 10 March as a target date by which time all the arrangements necessary for the devolution of powers to Northern Ireland should be in place.</P>

      <P>An essential prerequisite for eligibility under the TB and brucellosis eradication hardship grants scheme is that the holding of the herdowner in question remains restricted following a full herd retest. Following the disclosure of a factory lesion on 11 December 1998 the holding of the person named was restricted on 15 December 1998. The herd is scheduled for a balance of herd test on 21 February 1999 and a full herd retest at a later date. If the holding remains restricted following the completion of the full herd retest, eligibility for hardship grant compensation will be determined at that stage.</P>
      <P>The herdowner in question was potentially eligible for a winter fodder payment under either the mountain grazing scheme for ewes or the suckler cow scheme. However, as he was not an applicant under these schemes in 1998, the winter fodder payment criteria have not been met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the charter of farmers rights, balancing payments under suckler cow and special beef premia schemes should commence early in the year following year of application. Balancing payments under the May 1998 suckler cow scheme commenced this week and 93 per cent of applicants have already been paid £27.472 million bringing the total paid to date under this scheme to over £136.6 million. The position with regard to County Sligo is that 94 per cent of all May 1998 applicants have been paid their suckler cow balances. Of the remaining outstanding cases, some 48 cases are under query and have not been cleared for payment at local office level. Another 44 applicants cannot be paid because they do not hold suckler cow quota. The remaining applicants have problems and outstanding queries with their area aid applications. In so far as the October 1998 suckler cow scheme is concerned, full payments cannot commence until <Col N="1360" /> after the six month retention period expires at the end of April 1999.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland has exceeded its national quota under the 1998 special beef premium scheme, balancing payments under this scheme cannot be made until such time as the rate of premium is determined. All 1998 ten month applications must be examined and processed before the quota excess is determined and the appropriate payment rate calculated. In the meantime, 80 per cent advance payments will issue in February and March in respect of November and December applications respectively, following completion of the two month retention period. Furthermore, it should be noted that not all applicants will ultimately receive payment. A certain percentage under each scheme fail to establish eligibility and, accordingly, cannot be paid. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to give an accurate estimate of the number of farmers awaiting final payments under these schemes. However, all eligible applicants under both suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes will be paid by 30 June 1999, in line with EU regulations and charter commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from concerns about distortions of competition in the area of artificial insemination, the 1998 Finance Act changed the VAT treatment of livestock semen sales and services. It required that AI stations and other taxable persons who sell livestock semen directly to farmers should register and account for VAT if sales of semen exceeded the goods registration threshold of £40,000 in any 12 month period. Sales of livestock semen were chargeable at the 12WP extended char 4,17 per cent rate of VAT. Sales of pig semen by farmers are also subject to the same registration and rate requirements. AI stations retain their flat rate farmers status and do not have to register in respect of any AI service they provide.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case made by the IFA in this regard. Introducing a change to the VAT regime for pig semen only could undermine the equal treatment of sales of livestock semen introduced in the 1998 Finance Act. The Revenue Commissioners will be meeting a firm in this sector shortly to discuss this issue but, while they will be examining the matter, I do not anticipate the prospect of a change in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The dental health action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service. A consultant-led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can provide this treatment only where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area and the maintenance of waiting lists are the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.

    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Western Health Board.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has raised the concerns of the Deputy in relation to the risk of faulty testing and masking of results by steroids with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. My Department is informed that the BTSB currently tests for HIV, HTLV-1/2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis, using standard validated methods. The range of tests are as comprehensive as any in Europe and conform to existing international standards.</P>
      <P>The enzyme linked immunoassay, ELISA, tests used by blood transfusion services are extremely sensitive tests which detect hepatitis C infection in blood donors. These tests are automated and the only instances where the test will not detect hepatitis C infection in blood donors occur when individuals are in the early phase of infection before antibodies develop, which can take up to 66 days. This period is called the window period and to exclude any possibility of such donors donating, blood transfusion services internationally, including the BTSB, do not permit recipients of blood or blood products to donate for a year after administration. After that period they are again acceptable as donors if they fulfil the stringent health criteria in place for donation and test negative for the above viruses. Since the individuals referred to by the Deputy were exposed to anti-D, which had the potential to transmit infection between five and 20 years ago, the concern about failure of testing due to the window period donations does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> The actual residual risk, even for a donor donating in the window period, is extremely low and in Ireland has been calculated to be 1: 500,000. To further exclude this possibility, the BTSB in line with other transfusion services is in the process of evaluating and introducing new technology in association with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to detect such donors. My Department has made the necessary funding available for the introduction of such sophisticated technology which is called polymerase chain reaction, PCR. Extensive experience in Germany and Scotland with PCR testing has shown that apart from donors in the window period mentioned above, immunosilent donors, that is, donors who are infectious but are negative for HCV antibody, have not been found.</P>
    <P>The donor questionnaire which blood donors complete prior to donating includes, <i>inter alia</i>, questions as to whether the individual has attended a doctor in the last 12 months and whether he or she has been admitted to hospital or had medical investigations/surgical procedures as an outpatient in the previous 12 months. Further questions concern whether he or she is receiving any form of medical treatment and whether he or she is feeling well and healthy. Potential donors are also asked whether they have ever used a needle &ndash; even once &ndash; to take any drugs, including body building steroids. Therefore, individuals who could be immunosuppressed or who are on drugs, such as steroids, which interfere with the immune system are not acceptable as donors. These deferral criteria are under constant review and conform to the highest international standards.</P>

      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that staff numbers on the hospital's payroll at 11 October 1998 were 139 whole-time equivalents above approved levels. This number included 40.7 commissioning staff which the hospital anticipated would be released by April 1999. The Department is currently awaiting the hospital's service plan for 1999 which should provide details on the current position and state how the hospital proposes to manage this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage except that to say that I expect the hospital to comply with relevant labour legislation and <Col N="1369" /> best industrial relations practice in accordance with the industrial relations protocol agreed with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>Public hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway currently providing paediatric haematology services were advised recently by my Department that following a recommendation by the National Cancer Forum, all children with cancer will initially be referred to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin, for assessment and advice/referral on treatment. The National Cancer Forum is an expert body, chaired by Professor James Fennelly, which advises the Minister on all aspects of cancer services. Its principal concern is the quality of care and service which offers best outcome for patients.</P>
    <P>The question of the most appropriate means for organising acute hospital services for children has been under discussion and debate for a number of years without agreement being reached as to the best location for certain services. In these circumstances and conscious of the need for quality services for children diagnosed with leukaemia, I asked the National Cancer Forum to examine issues in relation to the provision of treatment for such children and specifically to advise on the most appropriate approach to the assessment, care planning and follow up of cases.</P>
    <P>In looking at this area, the forum's major and paramount concern was to identify how best to provide a high quality service for children, from initial diagnosis through to all forms of appropriate treatment. Account was taken of expert international evidence, which indicates that there should be one paediatric oncology unit per five million population, and that the treatment of solid tumours should not be separated from the treatment of leukaemia. The international evidence also indicates that a paediatric cancer unit should have the appropriate infrastructure of services, personnel and equipment to provide the optimum level of service to children.</P>
    <P>The forum subsequently recommended that all paediatric oncology cases should be referred to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Crumlin for initial diagnostic work-up and treatment planning. This does not mean that all cases would necessarily have to be treated in Crumlin. However, given the level of specialised expertise required in dealing with paediatric oncology, the forum recommended that every childhood case of cancer should be seen in Crumlin initially for advice/referral on treatment. Subsequent treatment, including chemotherapy, could then be delivered in the child's most appropriate local hospital, on a clearly defined and agreed share care basis, subject to proper supervision. Health agencies have been asked to commence discussions in the near future as to how best to implement this decision and the Department has stressed the need for close working relationships between the relevant hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am confident this collaborative approach will facilitate the continuing provision of high quality services for children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> I wish to emphasise that there is no question, nor was any proposal put to me, of transferring the haematology unit at Tallaght Hospital to Crumlin. I also stress that, contrary to some completely inaccurate media reports, I have no intention of closing the unit at Tallaght. No proposal in this regard was ever made to me, nor have I ever considered this step. It simply does not arise.</P>
    <P>The provision of specialist paediatric surgery has also been under discussion for a number of years. Currently surgeons work between the three hospitals but this requires the consultants to cover an extensive number of hospitals and also necessitates full specialist on-call teams at each site. Comhairle na nOspidéal reviewed the existing structure and in November 1998 put forward its recommendations in this area, namely, that paediatric surgery should continue at the three hospitals but that Crumlin should be designated as the specialist paediatric surgery centre. Comhairle na nOspidéal's proposal incorporates the appointment of an additional surgeon and the restructuring of current posts. I understand that this recommendation has the support of the existing paediatric surgeons.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the hospital's service plan is due in my Department within the coming weeks, following which officials will meet the hospital management to review the plan. Without having sight of the hospital service plan, it is not appropriate for me to comment on what it may contain.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive range of support services is provided for people with physical and sensory disabilities, which includes the young chronically sick. The range of services is designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. In cases where a person is unable to live in the community, appropriate long-term residential facilities are provided. Such facilities are not necessarily health board run. For instance, a board may pay the cost of care in a privately owned nursing home where such a facility meets the needs of a particular person with a disability. I have no plans to introduce a scheme whereby a person with a disability is given a subvention or other similar benefit to help pay for such a facility.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the <Col N="1374" /> telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck. To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people aged 65 or over must be living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves. As it would appear that the person referred to in the Deputy's question is living with her daughter and does not therefore satisfy the living alone condition outlined above, it would not be possible to provide any assistance under the scheme in this case. However, if her circumstances have changed she may wish to contact her local voluntary organisation which provides support to older people about this matter. The scheme is currently being reviewed by consultants and their final report will be available shortly. The future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was initially allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. This is on top of another £5 million paid on this scheme in 1997. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met. It is <Col N="1375" /> a fact that not all applications received under the 1996 and 1997 schemes were funded at a level of 90 per cent. No decision was made by me to change the basis for making awards under the scheme in 1998. Therefore, I am satisfied that the level of funding made available in 1998 was sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again that year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people were assisted in 1998. This means that since I came into office this Government has spent £10 million on the scheme as opposed to the £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The former lock-keeper at Carlow lock-house has continued to occupy the lock-house since retiring in 1992. The private development overlooking the lock-house is not on canal property and was granted full planning permission by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>The lock-house has been the subject of repeated flooding over the years. As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works is considering a number of options for flood alleviation in the Carlow area and I am advised that the implementation of such a scheme is necessary to deal with the ongoing flooding problem at the lock-house.</P>
      <P>I understand that the occupants intend to return to the house shortly. Should they apply to the local authority for alternative accommodation, my Department will support their application. An official of the Waterways Service has carried out an inspection of the property and has discussed the matter with a relative of the former lock-keeper.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the following monuments: the ruins of the ecclesiastical site known as St. Managhan's church and graveyard, founded by St. Manchan in the 7th century at Leamonaghan and the ruins of a small oratory and enclosure known as St. Mella's cell which are east of St. Managhan's church and graveyard. Neither of these archaeological sites are in State care and Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service in my Department &ndash; is not in a position to undertake any works there.</P>
      <P>These sites are protected under the National Monuments Acts 1930-1994 as &ldquo;recorded monuments&rdquo;. This requires anybody proposing to carry out works which in any way interferes with the monuments to give my Department two months written notice of such intention.</P>

However, I frequently meet with senior representatives of these organisations at sports and social events.</P>
      <P>On 13 October of last year, the Government agreed to the commissioning of a feasibility study for the development of a national stadium, and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct the feasibility study and to make recommendations based on the findings of the study.</P>
      <P>The steering committee is chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh and includes representatives from major sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Government Departments. Through this process, the major sporting organisations will be in a position to bring their own particular perspectives to bear.</P>
      <P>The committee will be overseeing the preparation of a feasibility study which will address the issues necessary for the Government to make an early decision on the matter. A process to select experts to carry out the study is now under way and it is expected that the finalised study and the steering committee's recommendations on it will be available for consideration by the Government by September 1999.</P>

      <P>I have been aware for some time of staffing difficulties in County Kildare VEC and I have met with the VEC in the matter.</P>
      <P>The allocation of clerical, administrative and maintenance staff in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme-wide basis and it is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy sanctioned staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that any case for an increase in staffing has to be approached in the context of Government policy on public service numbers and staffing norms in the vocational education sector as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Kildare VEC has made a number of representations to my Department concerning the adequacy of staffing levels in the scheme in view of the increase in pupil numbers and the expansion of programmes. Arising from these representations, my Department carried out an examination of the staffing levels in 1995. In addition, the grading structure of the VEC was evaluated by an independent consultant. Arising from these reports, the clerical staff complement <Col N="1383" /> for County Kildare VEC was increased from 15.8 to 17.8 posts and a new senior management grade was created in the committee. This allocation was arrived at on the basis that it compared favourably with other schemes of similar size. Further increases in the administrative staffing compliment of the VEC have since been approved by my Department to support the ESF and PLC student maintenance grant schemes and the operation of the VTOS and Youthreach programmes.</P>
    <P>A recommendation of the independent consultant was that the need for the appointment of an assistant principal officer in the VEC should be reviewed at a later date. My Department has agreed to have this review carried out and is engaging with the committee and IMPACT, the union which represents the clerical and administrative staff in the VEC sector, concerning the detailed arrangements for this review.</P>
