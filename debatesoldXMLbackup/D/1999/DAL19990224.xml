    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 10, 11 and 12 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 26, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 35 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of a Minister or a Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) Members may share time; and (iii) a Minister or a Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; the Dáil on <Col N="2" /> its rising today shall adjourn until 12.30 p.m. on Thursday, 25 February 1999; and Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 48 &ndash; Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, 1998, Second Stage, shall be taken between 5.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 10 concerns Geneva Conventions. In his work at EU level, will the Taoiseach give some attention to the developing serious situation between Turkey and Greece as it affects Cyprus and, ultimately, as it affects the enlargement of the European Union which could be blocked by this dispute? Will the Taoiseach deploy his influence to ensure a specific resolution of the difficulties currently developing between those two friendly countries?</P>

      <P>We never know when there will be a major drowning at sea. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Marine Emergency Service Bill, which deals with this issue, is not to be introduced in the House, according to a Government statement, until next year? Is this issue not more urgent given that we are so insistent on defending our coastal rights, our 200 mile limit and so forth? We should at least have proper modern legislation to deal with marine rescue rather than having to rely on other states to undertake marine rescue in our territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a very good service which has developed substantially over the years, and the people involved in it do an excellent job. The heads of the Marine Emergency Service Bill, which is to develop marine emergency capabilities for the future, are being prepared in the Department. Publication is not expected before next year. I am sure the Departments are doing all they can in this regard. The general scheme is being prepared in the Department and will be circulated to the Government early next year for drafting authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Upton family, my parliamentary colleagues and myself, I express our deepest appreciation for the manner in which tributes were paid to the late Deputy Upton yesterday. It is very much appreciated on our part and I thank unreservedly every Member of the House and yourself, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>On promised legislation, the Taoiseach indicated to me last week that the Government was contemplating introducing legislation to enable asylum seekers work while their applications for asylum were being adjudicated upon. There is a report in one of today's newspapers that the Cabinet will meet next Monday and may introduce legislation to facilitate this. When the Taoiseach spoke to me about this matter he indicated it would be dealt with in the middle or second part of this year. Does the newspaper report indicate the Taoiseach has decided to bring forward this legislation and, if so, will he give an indication of the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>What I told Deputy Quinn last week was correct; the Work Permits Bill to deal with the work permits regime in respect of non-EEA nationals working in the State will be introduced in the middle of or late this year. The gen<Col N="4" /> eral issues are the subject of ongoing discussion at Cabinet and will be discussed again next Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify this point? There are two issues here, one being the general work permit legislation which is subject to review and renewal. Do I understand the Taoiseach to say that a separate but connected issue to do with asylum seekers, is currently being considered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which would allow them to work while here? Will that require legislation as distinct from a Government decision and, if so, when will it be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been discussing all of these matters for some time. Any changes made could be worked into the legislation currently in preparation.</P>

        <b>:</b> Last Thursday, the Dublin District Court dismissed four drink driving cases on the basis that the prosecution could not prove that the specimens had not been interfered with between the time they were given to the Garda Síochána and the time they reached the State laboratory. Obviously, this has serious implications for section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. What is the legal advice in relation to the status of that section? Is it intended to appeal the decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should put down a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister and his Department have been discussing that court case, but I think it is more appropriate for a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach a question on item 73 on yesterday's Order Paper? Last week I raised the issue of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform making orders under section 5 of the Aliens Act, 1935, part of which has been found to be unconstitutional. Legislation currently before the House would retrospectively validate that, but the opinion of the Oireachtas on the legislation has not yet been tested. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the orders made that purport to be constitutional are constitutional and has the Attorney General so advised the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government plans to bring in legislative measures to deal with the phenomenon whereby insurance cover is apparently now to be dictated by place of residence and size of car? It is an unconscionable situation that the concept of what is being called burdened borrowing will determine who gets insurance cover and who pays the penalty for not getting such cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has ordered officials in her Department to contact the company with a view to clarifying the situation. The Tánaiste's comments are in the public domain. We will have to see precisely what the company is about in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a form of cherrypicking. It is simply not acceptable that if one is living in Tallaght or certain other areas one will pay 25 per cent more for insurance, or cannot get it at all, whereas those in more affluent circumstances will be treated more favourably.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a question concerning promised legislation on behalf of many charities of good standing in the country that have been seeking such legislation. Recently we were told that the Fundraising for Charitable and Other Purposes Bill would be taken shortly. What is the Taoiseach's explanation of &ldquo;shortly&ldquo;? Has a date been set in this session for that legislation?</P>
      <P>Will the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill definitely be taken this session in light of the legal action pending in Europe against Ireland? Ireland has the worst record on habitat protection in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said recently, work on preparing the general scheme of the Fundraising for Charitable and Other Purposes Bill is proceeding in the Department as quickly as possible. It is a question of legislative priorities but work is proceeding on it. I do not have a definite date but I <Col N="6" /> have asked that the legislation be moved on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill was published yesterday. When does the Taoiseach expect this Bill will come before the House? Is there some inadvertent mistake in the publication of the Bill? Do I understand the position correctly to be that a candidate in a Dáil or European election will be limited in his or her expenditure while candidates for an urban council may spend as much as they like?</P>

      <P>The reason I am asking this specific question whether the Taoiseach and the Government will consider postponing the Bill to amend the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act is that it will not deal with boundaries for the Údarás elections.

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, Regulations, 1999: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&ndash;</P>
    <P>Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, (Section 13 (4)) Regulations, 1999,</P>
    <P>copies of which Regulations in draft were laid before Dáil Éireann on 16th February 1999.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these regulations is to extend, by a further five years, the operation of the provisions of section 13(3) of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, to enable leases to continue to be made with financial services companies in the International Financial Services Centre in the Custom House Docks area without rights to a new tenancy accruing. The Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority have recommended that a further extension is required having regard to the importance of the continued development of the financial services industry and its contribution to continuing growth in the economy. The extension will also give certainty to future business arrangements.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act provision, which was introduced by way of an amendment to that Act in section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1989, gives landlords, in the form of development companies, and tenants in the form of financial services companies, flexibility to make letting arrangements in the IFSC which are appropriate to their respective needs. It does so by disapplying the provisions of section 13(1)(a) and (b) of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980 in so far as financial services companies locating in the Custom House Docks area are concerned.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, as most recently amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1994, tenants, or their predecessors in title, who have five years' continuous occupation of a commercial tenancy, have a right to a new tenancy of 20 years duration or of such lesser term as the tenant may nominate, subject to the proviso that it shall not be fixed for less than five years without the consent of the landlord. Tenants in general have a right to a new tenancy under section 13(1)(b) of the 1980 Act where they have been in continuous occupation for 20 years. Present landlord and tenant legislation also provides that, in respect of premises used wholly or exclusively as an office, tenants can renounce their right to a renewal of the tenancy, provided such renunciation is executed prior to the commencement of the tenancy and that the tenant has received independent legal advice in relation to the renunciation.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act was passed against a background where very short letting arrangements were often the norm and the only counterbalance to this were leases of very long duration. In the latter case, the length of lease acted to protect the lessor's large financial investment in premises. Having made such an investment in premises, a company would naturally wish to retain control of <Col N="11" /> that investment. That would not be the case if they were to grant a medium-term lease of say ten years because under existing law a commercial tenant under such a lease has a right to a new tenancy of 20 years and applications to court to fix rent etc. could be involved.</P>
    <P>It was then the case that, with regard to international financial services companies in other countries, the tendency was to go for medium-term leases of up to ten or 15 years duration. In all the circumstances the features of business lettings under the law as it stood needed to be adapted to meet the particular needs of both landlord and tenant in the Financial Services Centre. That need remains.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act was introduced after it was represented to the then Minister for Justice by the Custom House Docks Development Authority, which was charged with developing the Custom House Docks Area, that the application of existing landlord and tenant provisions to the Financial Services Centre would be satisfactory neither to landlord nor tenant and that it would be better if the parties had more flexibility to negotiate and agree on the length of the lease and the terms for its renewal. At that time this House was very sympathetic to those arguments and accepted the need for the legislation which went before it.</P>
    <P>I will dwell briefly on the main provisions of the legislation which touch upon the regulations which are the subject of this motion. Section 1 of the 1989 Act inserted additional subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) in section 13 of the 1980 Act. Subsection (3)(a) provides that occupation by a financial services company in the docks area shall not be regarded as occupation for the purposes of section 13 and the effect is to preclude those companies from a statutory right to renewal of a tenancy &ndash; at the same time it will still enable the parties concerned to agree their own terms under a lease.</P>
    <P>Under subsections (4) and (5), subsection (3) only affected leases made during the period of five years after the passing of the 1989 Act unless that period was extended to cover leases made after that period. In regulations made by the Minister for Justice in February 1994, that period was extended by another five years and is due to expire at the end of this month unless further extended. The aim of these regulations is simply to provide for an extension of a further five years.</P>
    <P>Under section 13(5) of the 1980 Act, the draft regulations, prior to signature by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are required to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has to be passed by each House.</P>
    <P>The development of the International Financial Services Centre is widely acknowledged as having made an outstanding contribution to the economic development of Dublin city and to the economy as a whole. The International Financial Services Centre has become the largest anchor project in Dublin city and is now the biggest <Col N="12" /> employer in the Dublin docklands area. For every job generated in the International Financial Services Centre, additional employment opportunities in support and ancillary services have been created. The continued presence and future growth of the centre is accordingly considered essential.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Docklands Authority's master plan for 1997 stresses the partnership dimension of the International Financial Services Centre involving a powerful combination of public and private sector organisations co-operating together to ensure the success of the centre. That partnership approach led to the existing provisions exempting the Custom House Docks area from the general provisions of landlord and tenant legislation and is also behind the proposal before the House today that these provisions be extended by a further five years.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mayo) Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I have no problem agreeing this motion to provide for an extension of a further five years to facilitate the making of leases with financial service companies in the International Financial Services Centre. I agree with the thrust of what the Minister said. Given that the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority regard the extension as necessary for the ongoing development of the centre and the financial services industry generally, we must support this motion.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the International Financial Services Centre in 1987 was very opportune. It happened at a time when the removal of national restrictions on capital movements was happening. Markets were opening up and financial markets were being developed. The computer software industry here was beginning to grow at an enormous rate. Large international computer companies were beginning to locate here. Our costs were becoming much more competitive. Our stable industrial relations climate was an obvious magnet. Decades of emphasis on and investment in education produced high calibre second level students and third level graduates. We did not come from a standing start position. While the international financial services industry was not large, we had a very solid and stable tradition of retail banking and insurance, which had begun to sprout wings overseas in search of international opportunities. Twelve years down the road, the success of the IFSC speaks for itself; it is enormously impressive. It is anticipated that 5,000 people will be employed there as we approach the turn of the century and the millennium. Companies continue to succeed because they realise the importance of innovation and of keeping abreast of best international practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government and on Government organisations and agencies to ensure the necessary legislative and administrative framework is in place and that the taxation <Col N="13" /> regime is friendly to an industry which is sophisticated, complex and constantly changing. There is no doubt that central to the success of the IFSC are the special corporation tax incentives, access to double tax treaties and double rent allowances. However, the problem hanging over everybody is the current attitude of Brussels; the attitude of uncertainty is extremely worrying. The EU approval for the special tax rate for existing companies expires in 2005, which must be a major cause for concern. What is of more immediate concern, however, is that relief may not be afforded to new entrants after 1 January 2001; this will be a major delimiting factor. Will the Minister clarify the current state of play as regards existing concessions and what is the prognosis for future entrants? There is little doubt that moves to damage the attractive tax environment of the IFSC or to infringe on it in any way, will have a negative impact on the future scale of development there.</P>
    <P>In May 1997, the international advisory group on the International Financial Services Centre published its report which was presented to the then Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell. I do not have time to go into the recommendations of the report, but there was a list of very worthwhile recommendations as regards the promotional role of the Taoiseach in the IFSC; the relationship between the Central Bank and the IFSC; the need to avoid duplication between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance; the need to enhance the advisory role of the Revenue Commissioners on international taxation affairs; the role of telecommunications and technology; future education and training requirements; and the ongoing marketing of the centre. In that regard, I pay tribute to the Industrial Development Authority, which, as the chosen promoter of the centre, has done a tremendous job in ensuring we attract the biggest and the best. Have these recommendations been implemented or what progress has been made?</P>
    <P>The issue of a new Landlord and Tenant Bill was raised on this morning's Order of Business by Deputy Joe Higgins. The reply was unsatisfactory. When in Opposition, the present Government introduced the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill, 1997; its promoter and sponsor was Deputy Woods. At the time, the Rainbow Government had the magnanimity to accept the thrust of that Bill. It was accepted for reading on Second Stage, endorsed by this House, went to Committee and has been in a cul-de-sac ever since. The purpose of the Bill was to provide for the abolition of all ground rents and for the payment of compensation to those whose interests were affected. The Bill proposed the termination of ground rents within a definite timeframe. When it was introduced it was seen as having merit; however it has not been implemented. The constitutional obligations have been analysed and dissected and yet there has been no progress. What is the timeframe for a positive response to this long overdue issue?</P>
    <Col N="14" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual for motions of this type to be debated; however I welcome the practice. The alternative whereby an annulling motion must be put down to deal with administrative decisions of the Government is bad practice. The argument is that everybody on this side of the House feels that but the mood changes somewhat when we enter Government. By and large it is important that secondary legislation should be closely scrutinised in this House. A huge amount of important legislative decisions are being devolved to Ministers who are signing them. I know from experience that an array of orders come before a Minister and he and his immediate advisers may not have a chance to examine them in depth. This is a negation of democracy. We will have to look again at some type of secondary legislative process to ensure that all secondary legislation and all instruments are properly scrutinised. I am not laying this criticism at the door of the current Minister or Administration; it has been practice for a very long time.</P>
      <P>I have put down an annulling motion on another order in the area of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I am greatly concerned about that. I know I am out of order and I will not refer to it now. However, I would like the Minister to deal with the issues I raised as regards orders under the Aliens Act, which in my legal opinion, are not constitutional. This matter needs to be clarified, without equivocation, by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The order before us refers to the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. Section 13 of that Act sets out the conditions for a tenant to claim a right to a new tenancy under Part II of that Act which applies to any tenement continuously occupied as a business premises for three years or continuously occupied as a private dwelling for 20 years. The amendment Act of 1989 inserted a new subsection (3) into section 13 of the 1980 Act. It provides that occupation under a tenancy in the Custom House docks area for the purposes of a relevant trading operation, within the meaning of the Finance Acts, shall not be regarded as occupation for the purposes of section 13 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act. In other words, the three years' occupation of business premises in the docks area will not, or have not, given rise to a renewed tenancy right.</P>
      <P>A new subsection (4) inserted by the 1989 Act provides that this restriction shall have effect only in relation to a tenancy, the terms of which commences within five years of the commencement of the 1989 Act or such longer periods as may be specified for the period being in regulations made by the Minister for Justice at any time during the said period of five years or during a period standing so specified. Such regulations require approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft regulations before us propose to extend the specified period from five years, renewed to ten, by a further five years. This would mean the right of renewal of tenancy <Col N="15" /> would not automatically apply for a period of 15 years following the enactment of the 1989 Act. As a matter of principle, I agree with the original Act; it was good to give security of tenure to allow people to make plans knowing they would have a right to renew their tenancy arrangements. For that reason, any modification of that fundamental principle should be reasoned for in a clear and good manner. I will not oppose the draft regulation before us; there is a specificity applying to the Custom House docks area and it is important to get the relaxation of this condition in order for it to thrive. However, I have not heard the Minister put forward a convincing argument, other than to say it is the opinion of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority that it should be the case. I dare say that many areas would like the same relief from the rigors of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act but their case has not been made. I think the Minister could have made a stronger case for the relaxation of these regulations for this case.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was set up under an Act which I, as Minister for the Environment, introduced. I recognised the wonderful work the Custom House Docks Development Authority did in this development. After a slow start at a time when the economic regime at the time did not facilitate the development, it lifted off with gusto. The Government shared my view, which was strongly supported by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, that development potential should be extended to some of the derelict areas surrounding the docklands. Dublin is a marine focused city with a fine harbour on a famous river, but we have turned our back to the sea and neglected the development of the dockland area which is a prized development area in other parts of the world, for example, the dockland regeneration in cities such as Boston and Sydney. It is important in the new millennium that we develop the docklands area in a way that symbolises the new vigour, energy and economic success of Dublin as a city and Ireland as a nation. That is why I introduced and supported the Dublin Docklands Development Act.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Jim Higgins's concerns about the new level of scrutiny by the European Union and its implications for the strategy of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. There is a view we no longer can give favourable treatment or tax benefits for urban renewal to development agencies, except for residential developments. That has implications not only in the Dublin docklands area but across the country. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced the urban renewal programme last week but towns will get a much watered down version of what was available previously when commercial heartlands were regenerated to very good effect. The Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="16" /> and Law Reform will bear testament to the magnificent work done under that scheme. Towns which were in line for urban renewal, having seen the benefits of the previous schemes, feel cheated that the same level of funding will not be available to them. I fear that New Ross and Gorey in my constituency will not be able to avail of the same level of funding afforded to Wexford and Enniscorthy under the previous urban renewal scheme. I do not know how strongly the Minister made the case in Brussels but I fear the very ambitious plans for the international conference centre and a major public-private partnership development programme in the docklands area will be adversely affected by scrutiny from Brussels. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me in that regard.</P>
    <P>The international financial services sector has been a boon for Ireland. However, it is important that enthusiasm for this sector does not blind us to the potential for abuse. The role of the Irish Central Bank has changed very significantly since 1 January with the advent of the euro and I hope its role as a proper watchdog will be developed to ensure there is absolute probity in the financial services sector and that no difficulties arise with our European Union partners or anybody else in relation to the reputation of Dublin at some future date. These concerns will be shared on all sides of the House. On behalf of the Labour Party I support the Minister's proposals on the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate on this motion for their general welcome for these regulations. Deputy Jim Higgins referred to recent controversies surrounding the tax incentives in the Custom House docks area. Strictly speaking, these matters are wholly unconnected with the landlord and tenant issue, the heart of the regulations before the House, and I have no intention of straying too far into the interesting taxation byways that have been set out before me. It is a matter of public record that the European Commission has approved the capital allowance for buildings in the Custom House docks area but has initiated formal proceedings in respect of the double rent relief and rates remissions granted to tenants of buildings in this area since May 1993. The Government is putting the strongest possible case in reply to the Commission and hopes to bring the matter to a successful conclusion. The corporation tax regime governing the International Financial Services Centre is as follows: for new projects approved up to and including July 1998 the preferential tax rate will apply to the end of the year 2005 and thereafter the then standard corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent will apply, for projects approved after July 1998 the preferential rate will apply until the end of the year 2002 and the rate of 12.5 per cent will apply thereafter. The recommendations of Deputy Mitchell's advisory group have been broadly accepted by the <Col N="17" /> Government and the strategy for future development of the International Financial Services Centre taking account of issues such as the changing environment in relation to corporation tax, is now being put in place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred also to the ground rents Bill and I am advised that constitutional matters connected with this Bill have yet to be resolved and therefore I am not in a position to give a firm date for the publication of a new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Howlin's intervention but I am dealing with the matter as of now and the position is as I have outlined it. I am not in a position to say when the constitutional issues will be resolved. There are in the region of 370 stand alone projects in active operation in the International Financial Services Centre. These projects cover the broad spectrum of financial service activity including fund management and administration, banking, treasury and insurance. Some 5,000 jobs have so far been created in these projects, not to mention the many indirect jobs that have been created in the accounting, legal, information technology and other support sectors. Deputies will certainly join me in welcoming these initiatives and the extremely important and positive developments which are of tremendous significance to our economy and our prosperity. This further extension provided by these draft regulations will continue to disapply provisions in the law which in the view of the Dublin Docklands Authority are inappropriate in the context of the International Financial Services Centre and adversely affect the promotion and development of that centre.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition spokespersons for their contributions and their positive attitude to the motion. The motion will be of considerable benefit to the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Previously, I outlined the Labour Party's opposition to this Bill which could be more accurately termed a deportation Bill. It is not possible to summarise my comments in four minutes but there are fundamental principles involved, one of which I hope the Minister will deal with in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply unsatisfactory, in a constitutional sense, to argue against a Bill passed by the Oireachtas &ndash; the Refugee Act &ndash; and state that one proposes to leave it withering on the Statute Book without implementation for administrative <Col N="18" /> reasons. The constitutional responsibility of Government is either to implement an Act or to revoke or amend it. Fundamental issues of principle are addressed in the Refugee Act which simply cannot be glossed over. It is unacceptable in the absence of implementation of that Act to seek to amend, on a fix it basis, the powers of the Minister under the Aliens Act.</P>
    <P>I wish to extract a clear answer from the Minister to the point raised earlier by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, regarding the orders the Minister has continued to make under the Aliens Act. If the court has struck down part of section 5, with what prudence or recklessness can one proceed to make further orders under that section? That is an extraordinary practice.</P>
    <P>Apart from the mere legalities, there are other procedural matters. It is extraordinary that one would leave aside the principles of legislation passed by the Oireachtas and seek administrative procedures to handle this issue. Instead of utilising the existing strong legislation, which is based on rights and obligations in the international community, and addressing the issues that flow from that in terms of the proper procedures which exist in every charter affecting migrants and upon which we have a historical background which I discussed on the last occasion, we are leaning back on legislation which has historically served us badly. That legislation is out of kilter with the obligations we have effected in relation to the international community on human rights.</P>
    <P>I also seek a reply to the matters I raised on the last occasion in relation to the previously quoted approvals of such bodies as the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which seems to be more regularly misquoted than accurately quoted with regard to procedure. For these reasons this Bill must be opposed. There are other issues of legislation and law which are extraordinary, among them the enshrining of the principle of retrospection.</P>
    <P>Apart from the moral, historical background to our opposition on the basis of rights, the fact that an Act of the Oireachtas is being ignored and that this is a deportation Bill with no security by way of translation of rights to those affected by it mean the Labour Party will oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill, like the subject it addresses, is an emotive issue. It was depressing and annoying to hear the Minister's Second Stage speech turn directly to deportation. He said that the Bill would make clear, in unambiguous terms, who was likely to be deported.</P>
      <P>As Opposition spokesman in 1995 the Minister spoke as follows to the Dáil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The status of refugees is an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has any grasp of Irish his<Col N="19" /> tory, our history books being littered with the names and deeds of those driven from our country out of fear of persecution. ... We are presented with a unique opportunity to reverse the general perception of Irish refugee policy by initiating one which is sensitive, reasonable and has at its heart the aim of protecting those who need it rather than immunising ourselves against the fears which others suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the Minister said he intended to introduce fast track procedures to clear the backlog of asylum applications.</P>
      <P>Last year Monaghan received, for the first time, a contingent of 29 Romanians. That gave me first hand knowledge of how the immigration issue is dealt with. We regularly hear about the thousands of refugees who are waiting to be dealt with but the Romanians in Monaghan were met by the authorities within hours of their arrival in Castleblayney. Every effort was made to have them deported.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's opening remarks in this debate that he intended to deal, through every channel, with those who organise the illegal transportation of people from different lands to this country. However, once immigrants have arrived here we must accept that we are dealing with a different situation. The Romanians who arrived in Monaghan and other parts of this country left Romania in absolute fear. That was clear from the programme on this subject made by well known RTE journalists following investigations in Romania carried out by them and other journalists. If these refugees are sent back to Romania, there is no knowing what will happen to them.</P>
      <P>I thank and congratulate the support group for the refugees in Castleblayney. It ensures they have proper legal representation and receive a fair hearing. Given what is taking place at other venues in this city, one cannot help but contrast their situation with that of somebody who has £1 million and an extra £10,000 to give to those who can manage to get a passport. That was the situation until recently, although not as far as the Romanians are concerned.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the Romanians if they are sent home? They face a dire predicament. I implore the Minister on their behalf &ndash; others have made similar representations to the Taoiseach &ndash; to ensure that they receive a proper and fair hearing.</P>

    <P>The other issue which has been discussed by my colleagues in the context of this Bill is the need to let refugees take up employment. There are two reasons for giving refugees the right to seek work. The first is that it will give them the dignity of providing for themselves. Second, it would mean less costs to the taxpayer. The refugees would be helping this country particularly <Col N="20" /> now when there are notices in the windows of restaurants and shops throughout the country offering employment. These are opportunities for refugees to secure good employment and, in the process, save the taxpayer an enormous amount of money.</P>
    <P>I am glad some Members of the Government parties are committed to this course. I hope they will secure the introduction of the necessary legislation to allow refugees to take up proper employment. There is a need for personnel in some areas. It is difficult for Chinese restaurants to fill jobs for chefs. The amount of red tape involved makes it almost impossible. There have been successes but it is difficult for the industry and those who want to take the jobs and pay taxes when they find so many people ranged against them.</P>
    <P>It is only 12 years since Fianna Fáil welcomed the opportunities for thousands of people to leave this country. Members of all parties worked to find people the proper papers to allow them to work in the United States, Australia and other places. Millions of Irish people found employment, some legally and others illegally, throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We should remember our past when we look at this legislation. Long before the Famine, the Presbyterian minister of the church in Cahans, only a few miles from my home, loaded his congregation of 350 people into a boat and sailed to Canada. They had to traipse through Canada and America until they found a home in North Carolina.</P>
    <P>Last year I was privileged to be a member of a County Monaghan delegation to set up links with Prince Edward Island, Peterborough and other areas of north Canada. While we were in the new city of Mirhamishee, we were brought to Little Island. Thousands of Irish emigrants passed through there in that period and thousands of those who did not survive the journey were buried there. A young cleric and a young doctor who were sent to look after one group of emigrants were buried with them. There is an onus on us to remember our past and to make sure we deal sensibly with those who happen to find their way to our shores.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, apologise for supporting the Minister in making sure that there are no sharks making money from sending people here. There are people who have been in this country for some time, who have worked and paid their taxes, but find because of the tightening of the legislation that they have to give up their jobs. Now they cost the State money and face deportation. These people have a proud record of working and paying tax but because the Minister has decided to place severe restrictions on them they may have to leave.</P>
    <P>Those who are already in the country deserve an amnesty. The Minister will quote EU law to defend his position but Italy has found a way to introduce a second amnesty. We brought in amnesties for tax cheats. The Minister must con<Col N="21" /> sider an amnesty for those who have proved they want to be part of our society and who cause us no trouble. The Minister admitted that this Bill is about deportation, not immigration. He should rethink it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

      <P>The west of Ireland was ravaged by emigration. In the 1920s and 1930s people who did not speak English left Achill Island. Imagine how they felt arriving in America, London and other places. We are the most hypocritical nation, the greatest crowd of beggars; we go round the world asking every country to take in and look after our emigrants. We beg every US Senator and we have criticised every English Government for 100 years, although the English Government let our people into the country to make an honest living. Some of them may not have been treated with the respect they deserved but at least they were allowed into the country.</P>
      <P>I listen to people who say they do not want to see other nationalities or colours in this country. They do not even want to see their own people succeeding. They live in a very narrow world. We were glad to see our own people taken in by other countries. This Bill is a deportation Bill to get rid of people. In Italy they have decided to take 200,000 more immigrants into the country. The least we can do is take 5,000 people in every year.</P>
      <P>This week the Irish Government is negotiating CAP reform in Brussels and seeking further Objective One Structural Funds for Ireland. We are great at going out with the begging bowl to make sure we are looked after, but we must look after those who are not as well off as we are. Many of those who are in the country illegally cannot work. Some of them are working in the black economy in restaurants and pubs. I hope that what happened to Irish people in other countries will not happen here &ndash; that illegal workers will not be paid slave wages because they cannot complain as they should not be in the country.</P>
      <P>Those who are here, some of them with children attending school, are prepared to work. The least we can do is give them employment so they may have self-respect. We must assist those less well off than ourselves. It is the least we could do after the way we have cried for the past 100 years about the Irish emigrants.</P>
      <P>We talk about the Irish in cardboard city in London and what we must do for them. Governments have done nothing for our emigrants since the foundation of the State. There are many Irish people living in cardboard city in Dublin. We will do nothing for them yet we begged American Senators to get as many Irish people into America as possible. Every ambassador who came to the country was wined and dined by Taoisigh and former Taoisigh to make sure we got these visas. Yet we will not let a few thousand immigrants into Ireland at a time when the country is doing better than ever. There are people who will say they have not gained from the Celtic tiger, but there is a great deal of money available, and I see no reason we cannot take in some immigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Deputy Michael D. Higgins said this is a deportation Bill. We have to be fair. As part of the European Union we must take our fair share of immigrants. We must assist them; we must house them and get them into schools so that they can be integrated into society. We will have people who will not obey the laws and who will fail, but there are Irish people all over the world who have disobeyed laws and ended up in prisons. We will get the good with the bad, and it is time this country realised it has an obligation to look after these people.</P>
    <P>The Government should also look at the position of Irish emigrants who have not done so well. We should look at ways of returning them to Ireland. A woman came to my clinic last Saturday whose sister is dying in a hospital in London. She lives on the fifth floor of a building and has no relatives there. She wants to come home, and I have contacted the county council and the health board trying to get her home, but I have been put through the mill. It is difficult to do anything for that woman, though she is dying in a hospital with nobody to assist her. There are no provisions whereby she could be housed for the short time she has to live. She wants to come home to her relatives. She wants to come back to the country where she was born, though it did nothing for her. She left Ireland as a child, and all she is asking is to have the State assist her in her last days. That is not too much to ask. We have forgotten our emigrants.</P>
    <P>I was chairman of the Westport Emigrants' Reunion, and we held a function every year in London to which we charged only £2. We did not want the dicky bow organisations. Such bodies are well able to look after themselves. The Mayomen's Association and similar bodies have members who have done well for themselves in Britain. We tried to identify the people who had not done so well. We were successful in locating people who had not contacted their families in 30 years. We facilitated contact between family members and in some cases family members came back to Ireland. Parents cried on their children's birthdays and at Christmas because they had had no contact for years. Their children had failed and were ashamed to come home. There is nothing wrong with failure. We will have failures. However, there is nothing to assist such people.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation in this matter. We know how to beg: we have begged America and other countries to admit our emigrants. Some of those emigrants have done well and gone to the top of their professions. We must give immigrants an opportunity. We must let their children into the educational system. I am not saying the floodgates should be opened, but we should assist the couple of thousand immigrants we should admit yearly.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister. This Bill is a very good one. I do not agree with previous speakers that it is a deportation Bill. It is far from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Previous speakers mentioned those who left our shores, and emigration has been part and parcel of Irish life for centuries. People left Ireland because of religious persecution in the 17th and 18th centuries. They also left because they were deprived of the chance of making a living. They were driven from their lands or the industries in which they worked were forced to close because of harsh laws and high taxes. Penal laws of one sort or another forced many of our ancestors to leave our shores, never to return. Today, Irish emigrants are counted in their millions in every corner of the earth. They have brought to their new homes the values that have always made us proud to be Irish. Our people have always been willing to work diligently and laboriously in their adopted countries. Their aim was to make their new home a better place in which to live. This country experienced the worst human tragedy in our history 150 years ago in the famine of the 1840s. Emigration was a fact of life before the famine and has continued into our lifetime, with thousands of young people, the flower of our youth, leaving our shores from the 1940s through to the 1980s. Our missionary nuns, priests and lay people were also among those who left. They travelled to the four corners of the earth to bring the message of Christianity and a better quality of life to the poor and needy. No doubt their reward will be greater in heaven.</P>
    <P>I know what it means to take the emigrant ship. I emigrated in the late 1950s or early 1960s. I went to London to work and got involved in the Irish community there. I knew people from every corner of Ireland when I played Gaelic football in London, and it was the same when I went to New York after that. I am proud that the majority of Irish people are doing well. I played football against tough men from the Minister's county.</P>

      <P>Before I left Ireland I often witnessed scenes of heartbreak and grief as young people said goodbye to their parents on the Tubbercurry station platform, before that station closed. An aunt and uncle of mine who left never returned, though today young people who emigrate return often. Many of our young people still emigrate to America or Europe, but thank God the human haemorrhage is over, I hope never to return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economy is the envy of the western world, though we cannot be complacent. There are many ways we can make our country a better place for all. We have always been renowned for our compassion, generosity and friendship, as well as for our care for others. Many thousands of people are still forced to leave their countries because of poverty, wars and man's inhumanity to man. There is a clear obligation on developed countries to accommodate genuine refugees who are pre<Col N="24" /> pared to work and to obey the laws in their new home. Given that we are experiencing a skills shortage a reasonable number of refugees who are prepared to work should be admitted. Many of our people emigrated in the 1950s when it was easy to obtain employment. I am pleased the Minister is raising this matter at the Cabinet meeting next Monday with a view to introducing legislation which will allow those people to work here.</P>
    <P>A Russian man who arrived on a ship recently to Sligo got employment in a local factory, having first obtained a work permit with the Minister's help. That factory was pleased to employ him because he was able to work a machine which had arrived from Europe. The factory had experienced difficulty in finding a suitable person to fill the vacancy.</P>
    <P>The intake of refugees should be carefully monitored and controlled and the numbers limited to those we can accommodate and employ. It would be in the best interests of the country and of the refugees to allow them to work. All applications should be carefully monitored. Care should be taken to ensure that refugees allowed in were not involved in any undesirable activities before arriving here. I was on the Council of Europe for a few years and was a member of the committee of migration refugees and demography. I visited refugee camps in Croatia and Bosnia during the war where people suffered extreme hardship. Those people should have been able to go to a country such as Ireland for a few years until such time as their own country was a better place to live. I have every confidence the Minister will do an excellent job. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate. It is one of the most important social conscience debates we have had for some time. Emigration and immigration strikes a cord with all people and is something on which we can all reflect. Some of the most heart-rending stories ever told or written relate to the Famine, the emigration boat and the terrible hardship, pain and misery inflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, socials and presentations were a regular feature of country life. As a young fellow I thought it was a great opportunity for a céile dance and tea and buns but as I grew older I realised it was an exercise to bring people together to raise funds to enable somebody get away from the misery of unemployment, with no income. The presentation usually made by the curate or parish priest was always a wallet of notes. That was not unique to Cavan, it happened nationwide. As young people we did not realise the heartache, pain and suffering for parents, brothers and sisters who were never again to see their loved one. It was not until recently when, as chairman of Cavan County Council, I had reason to travel to New York that I witnessed the awful conditions in which many of these young people, whom we thought had done well, <Col N="25" /> live. As a nation I felt we would never allow that to happen anybody who came to us for help.</P>
    <P>There are people here who have come to us for help. We should not allow them endure the suffering our people had to endure through no fault of their own or through no fault of the country in which they sought work. The work simply was not available. We thought they were going to a bright new land. Those who come here and read about the Celtic tiger, the opportunities and the economy think they are coming to a bright new land. We should not disillusion them. We have a responsibility and a social conscience. Times are good here, successive Governments have laid the foundation. There is a job for anybody who wants work here.</P>
    <P>In a presentation made recently by the Small Firms Association to the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am a member, it was stated there were 80,000 jobs which cannot be filled. Yet there are immigrants here who are willing to take up those jobs but because they are not here on a legal basis they cannot be legally employed. I accept some are working and are paid cash under the counter. That is not satisfactory as those people are not registered and have no social insurance contributions. In the event of an accident, who would look after them? This matter will have to be put on a proper legal footing. Those people are hidden away in fear of making themselves known and that is not good enough. That is how our people were treated in the past and we should not treat those people in that manner. It is not as if they are depriving somebody else of a job.</P>
    <P>I am aware of numerous firms seeking people to take up various types of well paid employment and immigrants are willing to take up work as labourers, domestic workers or shop assistants. Those jobs are well paid with good accommodation and conditions. There are also professionals who have come here with their families. Some have arrived in containers and have had to endure terrible conditions for many days. The decision to come was not made lightly. They have left extended family members at home hoping and praying they have arrived safely in Ireland and that things are going well for them.</P>
    <P>The emigrants' letters from the 1940s and 1950s would never say exactly in what conditions those people lived. The people always gave the impression that things were great and they were doing well, and they usually enclosed a few dollars which they could ill-afford. That was the pride in the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I support those who came here in the same condition as our people left in the past. We should look after them. We are not talking about vast numbers of people, probably about 5,000 to 6,000 people. It is not as if these people <Col N="26" /> are displacing Irish people from jobs. This is a marvellous turnaround and I welcome it. There are great opportunities here and although 200,000 of our people are unemployed, they are obviously not suitable or capable for the jobs which are available because the Live Register has been screened. Employers cannot get the people they want, yet immigrants from Bosnia, Croatia, etc. are suitable and willing to work, but they must be officially registered. I do not want these people to be bundled off home because that is not good enough in modern, Christian Ireland and I will not be party to that. I will support the Minister if he makes a genuine effort to have these people placed on a proper footing so they can enter the job market, get work and have the same respect as we would want for our people in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Boylan, for sharing his time. Originally I had no intention of speaking on this Bill but, coming from the west Donegal Gaeltacht, which has experienced emigration for 150 years, I felt I should. In my parish, Gweedore, and in all of west Donegal, there is hardly one household which has not experienced emigration &ndash; at least one member of the family in this or a previous generation has left the county or the country to seek a livelihood. Most of them went to the UK, especially Scotland, but many also went to the US and all over the world. They were welcomed, made their living, and tried to keep contact with home. More than any other country, Ireland should have an understanding of this problem.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of literature by Donegal people who have experienced emigration. Every year we hold the Patrick McGill Summer School, which honours a man whose experience was typical of people from the end of the last century up to the 1940s. He left school at an early age and left west Donegal for east Donegal, Tyrone, and Fermanagh where he worked from age 10 to 13. He then made his way to Scotland, fought in the Great War, and eventually reached the US. Patrick McGill wrote many excellent books outlining the trials and tribulations of the Donegal emigrant, including <i>The Rat Pit</i> and <i>Children of the Dead End</i>. Last week, RTE broadcast a documentary about another typical Donegal emigrant, from nearer my home. As a boy, he left his home for the Lagan in east Donegal, as it was called, where he was hired out for a number of years. He then went to Scotland, the US, and finally to Alaska and the Klondike. His book was called <i>Rotha Mór an tSaoil</i>, the great wheel of life. This man was lucky &ndash; he struck gold, returned with it to Donegal and bought a house in Gortahork. I am glad to say his family are still living there. There were also the Rannafast writers, Séamus and Seosamh Ó Grianna, who had the same experience: &ldquo;ag dul go dtí an Lagan mar pháistí scoile agus ón Lagan go dtí Albain, agus as sin ar fud an domhain&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Ireland more than any country in Europe, and Donegal more than any county in Ireland, has experienced emigration. Hardly a household in my parish does not have relations in Scotland, England, the US or Australia, and some of my family had the same experience. Yet today, the Dáil is discussing the Immigration Bill, which someone said might be more appropriately titled the deportation Bill. Its objective is not to accommodate unfortunate people who, due to the political and economic circumstances in their countries, are obliged to come here. This Bill is not a welcome for them, it is designed to get rid of them as soon as possible with no questions asked, which is a great pity.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was a great campaign in this House &ndash; Bills were introduced, motions passed, and deputations sent &ndash; to legalise many thousands of our young people who had to leave for the United States in the 1980s. There was a great outcry when a number of them were sent home for not having a green card. The US authorities were reasonably lenient, because if they had sent back everyone without a green card there would be few Irish people left there. The US introduced emergency legislation to provide Donnelly and Morrison visas and other schemes to facilitate our young people who had to leave Ireland in their thousands because of the economic position in the 1980s. In some years up to 30,000 people emigrated, and at one point there were about 100,000 Irish people in America, many without proper certification. The US introduced legislation and looked after them, so it is no longer a burning issue.</P>
    <P>However, we have a burning issue in this country. We are dealing with only a small number of people, a few thousand, and we should treat them as we wanted our own to be treated in the 1980s and previous generations. That is why I have difficulty supporting this Bill. We have an economic boom, the Celtic tiger is talked and written about every day and we should be willing to share with those coming here, many of whom are skilled and have a lot to offer.</P>
    <P>When I was coming here today from Drumcondra, the traffic was heavy and I had to stop at traffic lights here and there. Many windows &ndash; hairdressers, shops, newsagents &ndash; displayed signs looking for staff. We may have 200,000 people unemployed, but there is hardly a business in Dublin which is not looking for staff. I see no reason not to allow immigrants to take these jobs &ndash; they would certainly contribute to the economy. There are also openings for skilled immigrants.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill. If we remembered our historical experience we would have more understanding of these people than many other European countries. I am, therefore, disappointed the Minister is not more liberal in his approach. We should treat these people in a more generous and Christian way when they come to our shores. I do not advo<Col N="28" /> cate that we open our ports and allow hundreds of thousands in, we are talking about only 10,000 people who will not make a great difference. These people will contribute more to the economy and to our way of life than they will take away. For that reason, I have serious reservations about the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is misnamed &ndash; it is not an Immigration Bill, it is a deportation Bill. There is an onus on any Minister introducing a Bill to ensure that its title reflects the content. That may seem like a small point but it is one which indicates a larger problem that exists in respect of the Minister and his Department. From the point of view of accuracy, it is wrong to present this as an Immigration Bill. It is a deportation Bill and its sole purpose is to provide powers, principles and procedures regarding the deportation of non-nationals. Its introduction highlights the fact that we do not have immigration legislation or an immigration policy and that deportations and the situation which obtains in respect of the Aliens Act form only part of a larger, more complex picture.</P>
      <P>I will refer first to the issue of deportations. We know that deportations are taking place but we have no information regarding their character or nature. Very occasionally we have been able to obtain an insight, a flash of understanding with regard to what is being done in the name of the Irish people. I have been made aware of a case in my constituency where an individual was deported and his girlfriend travelled to his country of origin to marry him. Fortunately that story had a happy ending but it is probably unique.</P>
      <P>In another case, the Costinas family described clearly, through their staunch friends, supporters and neighbours, the experience and ordeal of deportation. In that instance, the family, including the children, were placed in a cell and denied access to toilet facilities. In a modern developed country like Ireland, even the worst criminal is entitled to such a basic human requirement but in this case it was denied. That tells us a great deal about the experience of those who have undergone deportation. However, the larger story surrounding deportation remains and when a Bill of this sort is introduced we should examine it closely.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleague Deputy Howlin for pinpointing an aspect of the Bill which has extremely serious implications for the House. The Minister is reported to have made orders that are in conflict with the decision of the High Court, which has already determined that the Aliens Act is unconstitutional. The motion put forward by Deputy Howlin goes to the core of what we are doing as elected legislators. The Minister is purported to have made orders which are premature and to have made presumptions about decisions of the House in respect of the Bill which he is not entitled to make. The motion reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> That Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;having regard to the fact that the Immigration Bill, 1999, is at present before the House; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;being of the opinion that matters, the subject of the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1999 (S.I. 24 of 1999), purportedly made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the 3rd day of February, 1999, ought properly be dealt with in primary legislation;</P>
    <P>resolves, pursuant to section 5, subsection 8 of the Aliens Act, 1935, that the said order should be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    <P>That motion sets to right an abuse which is occurring at present and which is an offence to every elected Member of the House who has a job to do. That job, in the interests of the Irish people, must be respected and adhered to.</P>
    <P>One should not be too surprised by the nature of the Bill when one considers the track record of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the direction of the current Minister. Its policy is one of keeping the administration right, regardless of any other issues, and keeping the lid on a matter that is vaguely unpleasant, rather threatening and something to be feared. That attitude is extremely damaging. We appear to have a Department which is philosophically incapable of dealing with issues which form part of modern life such as people seeking asylum and the fact that we have international obligations which we must do our utmost to honour. We claim that we are good Europeans. If we are to be part of the larger international community, we must be able to act as good Europeans when dealing with global issues which are part and parcel of the experience of other European countries. Instead of having that confidence and awareness of moral and political obligations, we have a Minister and a Department which are constantly trying to keep a lid on pressure they perceive will be unbearable if any alternative route is taken.</P>
    <P>As an Irish person who was fortunate to grow up in this country, unlike many people of my age and those of previous generations who were obliged to emigrate and find acceptance in other countries, I find that deeply distasteful. Many Members have already referred to the fact that we are denying and negating that aspect of our lives, our history and our culture by taking a hardline and repressive attitude to those seeking refuge and asylum in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That attitude became particularly noticeable when the Department began to put a spin on what was said by various esteemed organisations. For example, when representatives of the UNHCR addressed one of the Oireachtas committees and explained in careful detail what their organisation was saying about the Irish approach. They stated that we had an opportunity to create a good model to develop best practice in dealing <Col N="30" /> with asylum seekers. That is what I heard and that is what they said. However, it is interesting that <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that they purportedly informed the Minister, according to the Department's spokesman, that Ireland had a good model in terms of dealing with asylum seekers. In effect, an &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; perspective was placed on what the representatives of the UNHCR had actually stated. In one respect the Department's attitude is laughable but in another it is deadly serious and it must be challenged at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>That kind of spin cannot be put on what we are doing to asylum seekers, particularly when one considers the positive approach the Italian Government has adopted in this area or when one looks at what has happened in other European countries. Some of these countries do not have the comfort of an economic boom, some have increasingly high levels of unemployment and some contain organised political groups that represent a new manifestation of a deep seated racism which dates back generations, which is disturbing and which is undermining the democratic system. They have, however, adopted an approach that is in tune with the times. With the comforts of economic growth and falling unemployment levels, we have not made that leap.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals established in 1994 prepared the ground for the Refugee Act, 1996. It was chaired by a Mr. S. Magner of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In its presentation on what needed to be done to update our legislation it stated, &ldquo;It is believed that a Government Department which has overall responsibility for immigration matters and policy will inspire confidence via the maxim that justice is seen to be done&rdquo;. It proposed the establishment of a tribunal &ldquo;which would be both independent and specialised and would be solely and exclusively responsible for considering applications for refugee status and the making of recommendations on these applications&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Department for chairing a committee which expressed this enlightened view which was at the core of the Refugee Bill which was supported by all parties in the House. It does not often happen that there is consensus on such a difficult issue. It will always be a difficult issue. It is wrong to presume that there will not be conflicts. Just over one year ago there was all-party consensus on an anti-racism motion which called for full implementation of the Act. It has still not been implemented. It is in limbo. The issue should be dealt with in a mature, responsible and progressive way.</P>
    <P>On 19 October 1995 the Minister, then in opposition, said:</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be aware that Amnesty International published a document setting out its objections to certain aspects of the Bill. It states that the category of &ldquo;manifestly unfounded applications&rdquo; is open to <Col N="31" /> potential serious abuse and grave injustices. It also states that experience abroad has shown that the use of fast track procedures save neither time nor money. I totally agree with the observations and criticisms of Amnesty International in that respect.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Minister has set aside the important parts of the Act and introduced a fast track procedure.</P>
    <P>The issue of the right to work which I have been promoting for a long time has been raised. I read the story in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today with great interest. When Deputy Quinn raised the issue with the Taoiseach it was clear the story was much sharper&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not. The Taoiseach was evasive and did not state that the Government supported the idea, that the matter would be dealt with and that legislation would be required. It appears a Bill will be introduced towards the end of the year. If asylum seekers were granted the right to work, nothing would change in terms of applications for asylum. What would change is that one of the sources of aggression, attacks and abuse would be eliminated. Many asylum seekers want to work. Their skills are needed. The Department should change its mindset that it is keeping the lid on the matter in case the genie jumps out of the bottle.</P>
      <P>Instead of harping on about what happened in the past, we should look to the future which is multi-cultural. If we fail to appreciate this, we will lose out. We failed as a society in the 1940s and 1950s when an isolationist approach was adopted and economic barriers were built. Increasingly markets are global. Young people understand this and have already made the leap. We have to determine whether we want to be part of the global network. If we are to succeed as a society in the 21st century, we will have to see ourselves in a world where boundaries are broken down and multi-culturalism is unremarkable because of the way we relate to one another. It is very good that those boundaries have been broken down. Let us not create new ones or rebuild boundaries at a time when they are breaking down elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this important and urgent Bill. The debate has unsurprisingly covered a wide area, touching on many facets of the question of the immigration and residence of non-nationals in the State and addressing also related issues in the area of asylum and refugees. While it has perhaps strayed beyond the strict ambit of the Bill, I believe it was proper to review not only the proposals in the Bill but also the policy and legislative contexts in which they have evolved and in which, once enacted, they will <Col N="32" /> operate. I have noted all of the points raised by Deputies and I will endeavour to respond to at least some of the more significant ones.</P>
      <P>A number of statements by various contributors suggest that the significant elements of my opening remarks were not fully appreciated. I, therefore, believe it worth repeating the essential points I made. First, I was castigated for my unwillingness to make the Refugee Act operational. I said I proposed to have proposals with the Government before Easter for an amending Bill which will provide sufficient statutory structures to allow for proper consideration within a reasonable timescale, both at first instance and on appeal, to 5,000 asylum applications a year instead of the 500 which the Act, as constituted, would be very hard pressed to handle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others know it is not a matter of administrative convenience, as he characterised it, which has dictated the position regarding non-commencement of the Refugee Act. It is, rather, the impossibility, as I have repeatedly emphasised, for any one person as commissioner to consider fairly and in a reasonable time all the 5,000 applications and more being made each year.</P>

      <P>I have consistently stated that it is not possible for me to implement the Refugee Act as it stands, no more than it was for the previous Government, because it envisages at most a couple of hundred applications per annum. There are now several thousand applications per annum and it is not administratively possible for one commissioner or one appeals authority to deal with the current number of applications. There are also arrears to address. Substantial amendments are required to the Refugee Act if we are to give effect to it in the context of the immigration problem we now face.</P>

      <P>Not for the first time, a number of contributors characterised me as being anti-refugee. They quoted a statement I made in the House regarding the history of the Irish people and the issue of refugees striking a chord with them. My position has not changed from the time I made that speech in Opposition. Those who cite it do not understand the issue. A refugee is not an illegal immigrant and an illegal immigrant is not a refugee. A refugee is defined in the Geneva Convention of 1951 and again in the 1996 Act as a person who is fleeing persecution for various reasons. An illegal immigrant is precisely what that term implies. A distinction is made between the two in legislation in every civilised democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputies of what I said in my opening remarks on this Bill:</P>
      <P>Simply stated, my policy is to ensure that every non-national who is genuinely in need of the protection of this State is identified and recognised as such as soon as possible after arrival here so that they can immediately start the process of integration into Irish society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the Convention.</P>
      <P>That encapsulates the policy of the Government and should also be the basis for the policy of every party in the House. It is not for me to say what the policy of each party is on this issue. As I have said on numerous occasions previously, I know what they are against but I do not know what they are for. Nor do the Irish people. It is unfair.</P>
      <P>I repudiate the unwarranted slur cast by Deputy Gormley on the integrity and motives of the staff of my Department. This insult was accentuated by Deputy McManus. I reject the attacks on the integrity and motives of the staff of my Department. We are dealing with a difficult and sometimes harrowing task. Unfortunately, staff must illicit the personal stories of asylum seekers and make judgments on foot of them. That is not an easy thing to do.</P>
      <P>I will not tolerate the rights of those genuinely in need of the protection of this State being hindered in any way by volumes of speculative or ill-founded claims for asylum made on the basis of a perception that if the application is unsuccessful, the applicant will be allowed to stay. The last Government, this Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have spoken out against such spurious claims.</P>
      <P>I quote from a document called &ldquo;Refugees and Asylum Seekers: a Joint Policy Statement of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and Trócaire&rdquo;, which was published in December 1997. In a paragraph headed &ldquo;Grasping the Nettle of Expulsions&rdquo;, it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties facing the Minister and the Department of Justice have to be recognised. A clear, fair and efficient adjudication procedure, with all the necessary attendant safeguards, will by definition admit not only those whose application is well-founded but also let in on a temporary basis many whose applications will be eventually adjudicated not to be well-founded. The inevitable and necessary consequence, if the system is to work properly, is that such applicants will be sent out of Ireland to some other country, i.e. deported or expelled. The nettle has to be grasped that deportation of some applicants (assuming that there are adequate safeguards in the system) is <Col N="35" /> an inescapable part of a fair and efficient process, and provides an essential protection for genuine cases.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures that there are adequate safeguards in the system not just for failed asylum seekers, but for other non-nationals liable for deportation. It behoves us all to grasp the nettle that deportations will in some cases be necessary and that Ireland is at present without that &ldquo;inescapable part of a fair and efficient process&rdquo;. That is why we need this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also indicated in my opening remarks my intention to replace completely the current Aliens Act and Orders with a comprehensive code of immigration and residence legislation which will ensure that in all aspects of immigration law the principles, practices and procedures will be clearly set out in a comprehensive, modern, fair and just code of statute law. This will mean that the people who operate the immigration and residence legislation and the people whose lives may be affected by its operation can clearly identify what exactly they can expect from the law and what the law expects from them. This Bill is the first element of that comprehensive code of immigration and residence law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin outlined a helpful catalogue of factors as constituting the elements of a modern immigration policy. This is the aim of the comprehensive code &ndash; to provide a framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible policies in this area. It is my intention to bring forward a comprehensive immigration and residence Bill this year, in addition to the trafficking Bill I mentioned earlier and this Bill, and to implement the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin criticised the provision in section 3(2)(i) which enables the deportation of a person where the Minister is of the opinion that it is conducive to the public good to do so. The courts have, for example, in the cases of <i>Osheku </i>in 1986 and <i>Tang </i>in 1996 upheld this power in the past. Other points made by Deputy Howlin on the details of the Bill have been noted and will be examined between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The effect of the High Court ruling in the <i>Laurentiu </i>case was raised by a number of Deputies not just during this debate but on the Order of Business and on other occasions outside the House. I remind Deputies that the High Court ruling in this case upheld all the procedural steps taken by me, my predecessors and my Department and found no fault with the principle of deportation. The only adverse finding in that case was that the manner in which the Legislature had given powers to the Minister in 1935 was found to be inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution. That judgment is under appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Work had been well advanced in my Department to put on a statutory footing the practices which were already largely in place surrounding the deportation process. These practices ensure, for example, that notice is given to a person who may become the subject of a deportation order so <Col N="36" /> that representations can be made. The effect the High Court judgment has had on that work is one of form only; instead of putting in place the substance of these clear and transparent procedures by making an aliens order, as had been my intention, I am now doing so by bringing forward this Bill. Accordingly, it would be wrong for Deputies to characterise the judgment as forcing my hand in any substantial respect.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by Deputy Michael Higgins that the aliens orders recently made by me are unconstitutional is based on contrived arguments. The High Court struck down section 5(1)(e) of the Aliens Act, 1935, which deals with deportation. The orders I made are based on other provisions of the 1935 Act which were not struck down by the High Court and were not an issue in the <i>Laurentiu </i>case.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of interventions in this debate. I am satisfied that I was legally entitled to sign the orders. They were carefully considered in consultation with the Attorney General. Had that not been the case, I would not have signed them. I am completely within my rights to have done so and it was not disrespectful to this House to have signed the orders. I had a duty to sign them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the dangers of racism and xenophobia. My record in this area since coming into Government speaks for itself. I have followed on the initiatives developed in the Department during the European Year against Racism 1997 by establishing the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism in July 1998. This partnership of Departments and agencies, together with non-governmental organisations, promotes an integrated approach to dealing with racism. Its structure reflects my view that to deal successfully with problems of racism and xenophobia, we must tackle them in a co-operative and community-based way. It is no harm to restate the abhorrence shared on this side of the House of the evils of <Col N="37" /> racism and the narrow-mindedness of xenophobia.</P>
    <P>I have a particular concern that the utterances of some groups commenting on matters of immigration and on asylum matters are unhelpful in both content and tone. Undoubtedly, the concept of Ireland as a country of net immigration, after a long history of the opposite, represents a welcome challenge to Irish society which we should be delighted to take on. However, naive, inflammatory or ill-informed comments of the type we have seen coming from groups on all sides of the public debate do nothing to create the climate of common sense needed for our society to be able to assimilate newcomers and at the same time respect the social and cultural diversity which they bring.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell and other Deputies who stressed the need for measures to integrate persons who are recognised as refugees or are allowed to remain in the State having been in the asylum process. To this end I have set up an interdepartmental committee to examine integration measures. I look forward to seeing the results of this committee's work because I strongly believe in the importance of integration which will be to the mutual benefit of both refugees and Irish society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins said that appeals against negative decisions on asylum claims are decided by civil servants rather than by an independent lawyer. The position is that Mr. Justice O'Malley, the retired President of the Circuit Court, had been doing the important work of hearing appeals for many years. When he indicated that he wanted to discontinue the role, I appointed not one but two independent lawyers who continue to provide this important element of independent review. These independent appeal authorities are required to be practising solicitors or barristers of at least ten years standing. I intend to deal with the whole question of appeal authorities in a more comprehensive way when I bring forward the amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, which are to be contained in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also suggested that I took away from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees the role of assessing each case. That is a complete misrepresentation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees simply did not have the resources to continue providing such a service and does not provide that service in any other EU state. The High Commissioner asked to be relieved of the task. That is the reason I put in place the current procedures after extensive consultation with the UNHCR on the detailed content of those procedures.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to treat seriously Opposition criticisms of the refugee determination process when one bears in mind that when this Government took office virtually no resources were devoted to assessing asylum applications. Under the previous Government, asylum applicants did not know when or if their applications would be processed. Starting in the next few days, assist<Col N="38" /> ance will be provided by the Legal Aid Board for asylum seekers in the processing of their claims and any appeal, where necessary, and such aid will extend in suitable cases to judicial review proceedings. This service will be located in the one stop shop for asylum seekers in Lower Mount Street, Dublin, which this Government established, funded and staffed at my instigation.</P>
    <P>When I came into office approximately 20 people were trying to grapple with the huge backlog of applications. There was one appeals authority and now we have in excess of 130 people processing these applications. I have increased the number of appeals authorities. I will implement the Refugee Act, 1996, and I will bring forward comprehensive legislation in the area of immigration generally.</P>

      <P>&mdash;seem to denigrate that progress with the same level of enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Howlin's remarks about an article in <i>Magill </i>magazine, I understand the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has indicated to my Department that this article was inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to whether we were getting our fair share of asylum seekers, and Deputy Ring referred to a &ldquo;begging bowl&rdquo; mentality. I do not know how Irish people abroad would regard Deputy Ring's remarks. I know that relatives of mine who have emigrated would regard them with the greatest disdain and would feel terribly insulted to be told they were beggars on the international stage. The Irish people contributed enormously wherever they went and it is unfortunate that a Member of this House should <Col N="39" /> describe them as beggars on the international stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies made much of the fact that in absolute terms we are getting fewer asylum applicants than many other EU countries, and quoted figures selectively in apparent support of this. In 1997, the most recent year for which I have reliable data, we were well above the EU average and in fact we were in joint fourth place on a <i>per capita</i> basis with Sweden. The Netherlands headed the list. The fact that on a <i>per capita</i> basis &ndash; the only valid way in which to make comparisons &ndash; we were so high in the table is all the more remarkable given that we are not on direct air routes to virtually any of the countries from which our asylum seekers came.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin expressed concern at the provision in section 2 which confirms the generality of the aliens orders as they currently stand. Deputy Fitzgerald expressed opposition to the principle of the Bill because it deals only with one aspect of immigration and residence law. This is an interim measure designed to ensure that, pending the comprehensive legalisation I will outline later this year, the State is not left without the protections which the courts have declared to be essential for the well-being of society and the protection of the rights of the people within it. As I indicated in my opening contribution, every state has a well-recognised need for effective laws dealing with the entry, residence and departure of non-nationals in the interests of the well-being of society. The effect of the High Court ruling is that, for the present, Ireland is without one element of these important protections. There is a danger that the international traffickers whose trade is the movement of people will perceive this lack as a weakness to be exploited; they have shown themselves in the past to be able to react quickly to legal and political developments here.</P>
    <P>There are people in respect of whom deportation orders had been made under the now invalidated provisions who have not yet left the State. There are other cases building up where the question of deportation falls to be considered, some of them involving persons serving sentences for serious offences. In the absence of legislation permitting the procedures to be either commenced or redone, all of these cases are in abeyance. For these reasons, it is important that this legislation be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley said that the attitude was to get rid of them &ndash; by &ldquo;them&rdquo; I assume he means asylum seekers &ndash; as soon as possible. Other speakers referred to fast-track procedures. There is a fine procedure in place whereby applications are given the deepest consideration. Each individual application is examined individually and a determination is reached. Following that determination it is open to the individual concerned to appeal to an appeals authority. The appeals auth<Col N="40" /> ority considers the application independently and reaches a determination. Following that, under our Constitution, it is open to people to go into the courts, and some have chosen to do that. That is their prerogative. Nobody should make the suggestion that each application is not carefully considered and that natural justice is not applied in all cases. It is.</P>
    <P>The determination process and appeals having been completed and, in some instances, the matter having been considered by the courts, and an individual continuing to refuse to leave obviously poses a problem for the Government and for society as a whole. The ultimate sanction, which is available in every civilised society of which I am aware, is deportation. That is being approached by some Members in this House not in a dispassionate, objective way but in an emotional way.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to a case which is <i>sub judice</i> and which I shall not name. She stated categorically in the House that people were jailed, were not even given toilet facilities and were treated in a degrading and inhuman way. These allegations may be strongly contested in the courts. However one may believe in one's argument, it is wrong to advance it by putting forward as fact allegations that may be strenuously contested.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems with the debate on immigration over the last number of years has been a deliberate clouding of the issues, in some cases by people who know what they are saying is simply not correct.</P>

      <P>Very often quite invidious comparisons are made which would not stand up to the test of any logical thinker. It is not for me to make judgments, but it is clearly for me to bring forward legislation like this, which the Government believes to be in the overall interests of the Irish people. There is no question of this country ever reneging on its responsibilities towards refugees. This country has always cared for refugees who should not be confused with illegal immigrants. It is unfair to genuine asylum seekers and refugees to do so. We will continue to honour our international obligations in this respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crawford said we must remember our past and, of course, he is correct. Every country must remember its history which often shapes the policy that determines its future. Let nobody be under any illusion that in considering one's history one also has an obligation to consider one's future, even though one may not be alive to see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill, the second I have introduced since taking up office, gives effect to the substantial improvements in social welfare rates of payment announced in the budget. It contains a significant package of improvements for carers. It also introduces new income support measures for farmers and fishermen on low incomes and a new bereavement grant.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses commitments set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium aimed at building an inclusive society and fulfils key commitments in Partnership 2000. The resources provided by the Government for social welfare improvements in the recent budget and in this Bill amount to £317 million in a full year, an all-time high. However, the Bill demonstrates much more than a delivery on this Government's promises and much more than unprecedented levels of spending. This Bill demonstrates a radical shift in the way we look at social welfare.</P>
      <P>In the past, social welfare started out from an assumption that the State should try to prevent abject poverty and should try to alleviate grinding disadvantage. The State, it was felt, should not allow people to be pushed over the edge. However, in the past that was felt to be enough. Nobody felt that social welfare could be a positive force, could register that we value older people, we value what carers contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" />
      <Col N="44" /> I have always believed that my Department should be a catalyst for change, should stimulate opportunity and not be resigned to limitation. The Bill I am proposing today indicates that this Government is moving towards a new definition of social welfare as responsive, flexible and, above all, designed to help individuals and groups express their true potential, make their contribution and know they are valued in a changing nation.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, our older citizens. We need to ensure that older people are freed to live their lives to the full. One cannot do that if one is trying to get by on too little money. That is why in our action programme, we are committed to increasing the rate of contributory old age pension to £100 over a five year period. In last year's budget the Government provided a special increase of £5 per week in the maximum rates of payment. This year we are going a step further by providing for an increase of £6 per week in such payments. This means that the contributory old age pension will now amount to £89 per week, an increase of £11 or 14 per cent on the rate when the Government took office and one third more than the rainbow coalition provided in three budgets. A married couple will now be better off by £9 a week as a result of the increases provided for in this Bill and £15.50 better off since we came into office. These increases represent real increases for pensioners well ahead of expected increases in average earnings.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to substantial increases in other social welfare payments. The personal rates of social welfare payments other than those for older people are being increased by at least £3 per week. A special increase of £3.60 per week is being provided in the short-term rate of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. This ensures that these two rates now exceed the minimum rate set by the commission, equivalent to £71.80 in 1999 terms, thus fulfilling the commitment in Partnership 2000. We will keep the level of social welfare payments under review according to the targets set down on income adequacy in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. I now wish to outline the provisions contained in the Bill. As Deputies will already have considered it in detail, I will focus on a number of key provisions.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, sections 10 to 14, provides for the implementation of the package of improvements for the carer's allowance. I want this Government to be known as the Government that put an end to the taking for granted of carers. We took a long hard look at the situation by carrying out an interdepartmental review of the carer's allowance. That review resulted in a number of proposals to improve the situation. I have acted on those proposals to the benefit of 11,500 carers and I have ensured that almost 3,500 new people are going to qualify for a carer's allowance <Col N="45" /> for the first time as a result of this Bill and the recent budget.</P>

      <P>From now on, those who care for children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance will be eligible for the carer's allowance. Eligibility is being extended to the carer of anyone between 16 and 65 who requires full-time care and attention. We are relaxing the residency conditions for receipt of the allowance and the full-time care and attention rules. Carers' social insurance records will be preserved and we are giving income disregards to carers in their own right.</P>
      <P>One of the main problems facing carers is isolation. We are addressing that in a number of ways, for example, the extension of the free telephone rental scheme to all people receiving carer's allowance and the extension of the free travel scheme to carers of people receiving constant attendance allowance and prescribed relative's allowance. One of the most important changes for many carers will be the annual payment of £200 as a contribution towards respite care to all qualifying carers. Perhaps Deputy Broughan will note that what all of these moves add up to is a 40 per cent increase on previous expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the review was the introduction of a system of needs assessment. This will take account of the needs both of the carer and the person being cared for. The Government has decided that such a system should be introduced and a working group, chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, is being established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a PRSI carer's benefit to facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care. This would be financed through the PRSI system. The proposal would, for example, require a small increase in each of the current employee and <Col N="46" /> employer PRSI rates depending on the level of the Exchequer contribution. This proposal deserves further full examination and I would be interested in the views of the social partners in this regard.</P>
    <P>Looking towards the longer term, a further PRSI benefit arrangement for care recipients, that is, those in need of care was also proposed in the review. Given that there is a high probability that many of us will need some form of long-term care, such an arrangement could enable care recipients to meet some or all the costs of their own care. The Government agreed, given the complexity of the issues raised, that this proposal should be pursued at both the policy and operational levels as a separate consultancy project and my Department will be progressing this later this year.</P>
    <P>Carers all around Ireland look after people in their own homes and communities. They make a huge contribution to keeping our society humane and decent. I am committed to improving their situation. However, it is more than a one Department commitment; the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have recently brought forward a range of measures to help carers, because the Government sees a multifaceted approach as essential.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, sections 15 to 18, provide the legislative basis for the new farm assist scheme which was announced in the budget. This scheme represents an important new development in the provision of income support for farmers. While the impetus for its introduction stemmed from the current difficulties facing low-income farmers, it must be recognised that the scheme is not a temporary one related to the current situation, but will be an ongoing feature of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, announced a further £20 million in fodder aid for farmers on top of the £21 million paid out before Christmas, bringing the total Government contribution to £41 million. Because of the continuing difficulties faced by farmers due to the scarcity of winter fodder, the Department of Agriculture and Food is making an all out effort to bring forward payments due to farmers that would not normally be due until well into March.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that the new allowance will be payable to farmers who are aged between 18 years and 66 years and satisfy a means test. The maximum weekly rate of payment will be equivalent to the long-term rate of unemployment assistance payable from next June, £73.50. Increases for qualified adults and child dependants will be provided on a similar basis as for social welfare payments generally. Income from capital will be assessed on the same basis as for other long-term social assistance payments.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the assessment of means for entitlement to the new payment. Under this section the farmer's net income from <Col N="47" /> self-employment, including farming, will be assessed at a rate of 80 per cent instead of on a pound for pound basis as currently applies under the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme. In addition, in the case of a farm family, £100 per annum for each of the first two children and £200 for each subsequent child will be disregarded when assessing the net income from the farm.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget provides for a full year additional allocation of £15 million to meet the costs of the new scheme, on top of the £33 million provided for the smallholders' scheme last year. The House will be pleased to know that the Government has decided to provide for entitlement to payment under the farm assist scheme from the first week of April 1999.</P>

The interdepartmental groups on which my Department is represented are listed in the schedule which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. In the case of four of these groups, my Department's role is one of actively monitoring their progress. These four groups are clearly indicated in the schedule. My Department plays a full and active role in the other 53.</P>
    <P>My Department has one representative on the interdepartmental committee on Ireland's security council candidature.

The committee is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's reply is rather brief. Question No. 3 is specific and refers to my question of 10 February seeking information on the number of interdepartmental groups in which the Taoiseach's Department fully and actively participates. In reply to my parliamentary question of that date the Taoiseach said he had a watching brief in relation to most if not all the committees. Should the supplementary documentation contain the information, will he indicate the interdepartmental groups in which his Department plays a real role? In regard to the schedule issued on 10 February in which he states the Department is represented on the Ministers and Secretaries General Group on EU policy, did that committee formulate the Government's position on regionalisation? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me draw the Taoiseach's attention to his reply on that occasion in which he said his Department is represented on a significant number, 54 in all, of interdepartmental groups and so on and in many cases his Department's role is one of monitoring the progress of the groups rather than full active participation. Did the Taoiseach say his Department plays a full and active role in 54 or 57 groups? I am somewhat at odds as to the current position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader of the Fine Gael Party will concede to me. On 10 February &ndash; and that is not exactly last year &ndash; the Taoiseach said in 54 committees his Department's role is one of monitoring the progress of the groups rather than full active participation. In how many groups does the Taoiseach's Department actively participate? The Taoiseach is a very busy man but will he indicate to us the names of the committee in which his Department has a hands on as dis<Col N="51" /> tinct from a monitoring role? His replies so far have confused rather than enlightened me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My departmental officials attend 57 interdepartmental groups. They believe they fully and actively participate at those meetings. To give a rough breakdown, officials from my Department play a role in all the strategic management initiative committees, the Northern Ireland Division committees, European and International Affairs, Economic and Social Policy as well as Partnership 2000 groups, information technology, Government Secretaries and Protocol Division &ndash; which is in my Department &ndash; the Information Society Commission which is answerable to my Department and there are also committees on finance, freedom of information and personnel. Officials who attend these meetings believe they play a full and active role. However, there are four committees on which their role is to keep a watching brief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my last supplementary question on the matter. May I remind the Taoiseach that in his reply of 10 February he said that in relation to the then 54 groups &ndash; he has now added three more to that number &ndash; in many cases his Department's role is one of monitoring the progress of the groups rather than full and active participation? What are the three additional groups in which his Department is now involved? Of the 57 groups, in how many do his officials have less than active participation? What is the identity of the groups in which his officials fully and actively participate? This is a question of which notice was given and the Taoiseach will have the information in his brief. He has the question and reply from 10 February. Somebody must have provided the Taoiseach with the information. If he does not have it now, he should give it to me at a later stage.</P>

The Department of the Taoiseach monitors the progress of No. 26 on the list, Expo 2000 interdepartmental and agency group. It also has a watching brief on the three committees I mentioned earlier.

      <P>Yes. The submission which was prepared by the Department of Finance came through the Ministers and Secretaries group on EU policy. The CSO was not involved in that. It carried out the statistical work. In the ongoing Agenda 2000 co-ordination work, the expert technical group on Agenda 2000, which I chair, is the group involved in the submissions and negotiations on Agenda 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

In the travels made by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other representatives of the Government, has the candidature been promoted? In the promotion of Ireland's candidature for a seat on the Security Council have issues regarding the reform of the Security Council, in terms of the composition of its permanent members, and related matters concerning the reform of the United Nations, been raised as a positive campaigning point by the Irish Government?</P>

      <P>Co-financing proposals are still part of the Agriculture Council's discussions but have less support than previously. They favour intensive rather than extensive beef systems which would work against us; 99 per cent of our beef is produced under the extensive system and these proposals would totally reverse the Commission's position of 1992. For that reason we oppose them and hope to gain support against these proposals from other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the proposals to maintain the maize subsidy and to treble the bull beef premium are designed solely to increase the amount of money being received by countries such as Germany and the Netherlands without any regard for the agricultural effect? This is purely to get their money back in a Thatcherite manner. Will the Taoiseach make these points strongly at all his meetings with them? Will he address public opinion in Europe on the idea that if we are to have a common policy, it should not be twisted to achieve nationalistic objectives of the kind being pursued by these two countries at this time?</P>

      <P>The statement I made the other night was extensively circulated in Europe to set out these points. I made these points when I met Premier Wim Kok. Deputy Bruton is right, these schemes are designed to assist net contributors to <Col N="57" /> address their concerns where they believe they have over-financed the entire package of European funds in recent years, particularly the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>I hope we are moving away from cofinancing into one form or another of degressivity. Deputy Bruton knows there were a number of proposals this week. The French proposal on degressivity would not receive our complete support but, when I discussed this with President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin last week, we agreed we would link our negotiating positions to arrive at a common position. We have managed to move closer in recent days and we will continue to do that.</P>
      <P>At 6 p.m. this evening, when the sessions of the Agriculture Council resume, it will look at these proposals, particularly those concerning milk and beef. It will also look at rural development in wine and olive growing regions which are not directly relevant to us. The points which Deputy Bruton made have been made and will continue to be made by us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in Paris on 15 February and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Wim Kok, in The Hague on 17 February. These visits were the latest in a series of meetings with Ireland's European partners which I will hold over the coming weeks in advance of the conclusion of Agenda 2000 negotiations in Berlin on 24-25 March.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in the House recently, these bilateral meetings take place in advance of an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government focusing on Agenda 2000 in Bonn on 26 February which President Santer will also attend. The exact scope of the meeting is not yet finalised. However, it is likely that it will deal exclusively with the Agenda 2000 funding issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards my meetings with the French President and Prime Minister, and the Dutch Prime Minister I discussed the current state of negotiations on Structural, Cohesion and Agriculture Funding. I stressed the need for an equitable outcome and indicated that the present proposals, particularly in the Agriculture area, if implemented would impact proportionately more on Ireland than on any other member state. I emphasised that while we accept the broad thrust <Col N="59" /> of the Commission's proposals, the proposals as they stand would damage both our agriculture industry and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that we are seeking to ensure an equitable outcome for Ireland and Ireland's farmers. I also discussed the suggested co-financing of the CAP. The French President and Prime Minister like ourselves totally oppose this proposal.</P>
    <P>My discussions with the Dutch Prime Minister also focused on Own Resources. I indicated to Prime Minister Kok that we are sensitive to Dutch concerns on the budget contributions and signalled our openness to changes in the budget contribution system.</P>
    <P>During these meetings, I outlined Ireland's significant development needs, particularly infrastructural, and the importance in that context of adequate transitional arrangements under the Structural Funds and continued eligibility for the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>The ongoing enlargement negotiations with those countries seeking to join the Union also featured in my discussions. I reaffirmed my strong support for the enlargement process.</P>
    <P>I also discussed the retention of duty free sales. Both the French President and Prime Minister have been strong advocates for the retention of duty free sales and will continue to lend their voices to the calls for an extension beyond the end of June. I indicated to the Dutch Prime Minister that together with the France, Germany and UK we would continue to press for a significant postponement of the current transition arrangements when the matter is discussed at ECOFIN in March.</P>
    <P>Apart from Agenda 2000 related matters, I discussed issues of a bilateral nature and took the opportunity to brief the French President and Prime Minister and the Dutch Prime Minister on the Northern Ireland Peace Process and to thank them for their continuing support at EU level for Union assistance for Northern Ireland. We also discussed external issues, such as Kosovo and the progress being made at peace talks at Rambouillet which the French Government are sponsoring.</P>
    <P>I also raised Ireland's candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2001-2002. In Paris, I took the opportunity to renew to President Chirac the invitation extended to him in 1997 to pay a state visit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last year I met the Finnish Prime Minister Lipponen in Helsinki in April, the Spanish Prime Minister Aznar in Madrid in May and the Portuguese Prime Minister Guterres in Lisbon in June. I also had a bilateral meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Dahaene at the ASEM II conference in London and will meet him again on 3 March in Brussels. I will also meet President Santer in Brussels on 3 March. While I would like to visit all our EU partners, clearly the volume of my domestic engagements and the priority that must attach to them prevents me from doing so.</P>
    <P>I sent a joint letter with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair to the President of the European Com<Col N="60" /> mission on 4 February seeking continued EU support for the Northern Ireland peace process. This letter sought to build on the Cardiff and Vienna European Council Conclusions on Northern Ireland which committed the Union to continuing to play an active part in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>No formal response to the letter is required. However, I hope the letter will heighten recognition of the situation of Northern Ireland as well as of the Border counties and that its timing, &ndash; immediately prior to the meetings between First Minister Trimble and Deputy First Minister Mallon with President Santer and Chancellor Schro1der &ndash; was helpful. The European Commission, as well as our partners, has consistently been generous in its support for the peace process. I will raise this matter at the informal EU Council in Bonn on Friday. The nature of that meeting is that no conclusions will issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view of the European Commission proposal that income supports for farmers in the form proposed for Agenda 2000 would not be available to countries joining the EU after enlargement? Does he feel this is consistent with the Treaty of Rome and its non-discriminatory provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our negotiating position that these resources should still be available to Irish agriculture&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the Taoiseach's view of the Commission's proposal that these aids would be available to Ireland but not to new applicant countries. Does the Taoiseach feel that is consistent with the Treaty of Rome, which is based on non-discrimination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the treaty discussions the countries for enlargement will seek resources similar to CAP resources. They made this very clear at the European Council meeting in Vienna in December. It was agreed then that these would be matters for the various countries seeking accession. Their position is very clear, and I do not see a position being held where they would not receive resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same basis as existing members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for discussion. It is moving far ahead to talk about a position before accession discussions have taken place. To pre-determine that now would be entirely inappropriate. In my recent meetings with the French and the Dutch I got the clear impression, that in agriculture more than in any other areas of funding, that there will be support for these countries on the agricultural front. That is one of the difficulties with the tough line being taken on the stability of expenditure. Stabilisation of expenditure is one of the key issues in these negotiations. <Col N="61" /> The Germans and the Dutch are seeking to achieve the maximum amount of headroom from the contribution of 1.27 per cent of EU GNP, which they do not want to breach either now or in the longer term, with the latter being very important to them. They want to achieve a position where, prior to enlargement &ndash; a time like now, given that the discussions conclude in a month &ndash; the maximum take for the present member states is 1.02 per cent. This will allow a significant amount for the enlargement countries, and expenditure in the CAP area in some form is also being discussed. These countries are taking a similar view on Cohesion Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the 1.27 per cent ceiling is unrealistic for a federation establishing the first ever single currency of its scale in world history? A budget so small is simply not sufficient to support a single currency. Is the Taoiseach aware that at the Vienna Council he and his colleagues decided that the European Commission would be represented at the G7 to discuss the world economy and that the Americans vetoed this? What right does America have to veto who represents Europe at the G7?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1.27 per cent of GNP is an issue which a number of countries have not accepted as sufficient, even for the current position. There is no chance of that figure being breached in the current round, so that is not on. The European Council made the decision regarding the G7, and I do not think the Council will accept anything other than the position it adopted. That view was considered at some length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It got away with it on the 20th. The Americans succeeded in challenging the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the European Council will challenge that, as it was discussed at some considerable length. The view was that the Council should have the right to do this. There have not been meetings since then, but the Council has a right to this, as does everyone else, and this position will be challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The 13 questions being taken together concern Ireland's negotiating position with the rest of our partners in the EU in relation to Agenda 2000 and related matters. If the Taoiseach accepts this, does he accept that these are the most difficult negotiations that an Irish Government has had to undertake since 1973 and that we have aggravated our opening position rather than reconciled or assuaged our position in relation to our negotiating partners? Does he accept that his Government has, since July 1997, specifically mishandled the relationship between this Administration and the other 14 States in the EU with disastrous attempts to renegotiate the corporation tax? That position, which was agreed <Col N="62" /> at 12.5 per cent before June 1997, went down to 10 per cent and then back up to 12.5 per cent. Does he accept that the urban designation proposals which have resulted to a delay of more than 12 and a half months regarding the IFSC and towns around the country have been delayed due to difficulties with that aggravation? There is still a debacle with regionalisation; this is breaking news as I speak because the Department of Finance will not release the text of a letter from EUROSTAT. There are allegations that Ireland was subsidy shopping at a time when our economic growth rate is four times the European average. In the area of farm support, Parliamentary Question No. 5 today raises the matter of bias in maize based beef production as distinct from environmentally friendly grass based beef production and is a clear indication that we are out of favour with our European colleagues. The reason is that this Government has, in its collectivity, mishandled our negotiations&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those discussions which we successfully concluded last year will prove beneficial for corporate tax. In regard to urban designations, every issue is being considered. The Commissioner concerned has taken a fairly tough line all over Europe. The negotiations he has concluded with us allow us to move ahead with the residential issues. I hope there is an understanding in the IFSC which will allow us move on some of the seaside resort schemes. We will not get as much aid as previously because these projects were viewed as regeneration projects but now will have to be regeneration projects linked to deprived areas or areas that show a particular character. That is not unreasonable. I can understand the Commission's position that an area where a site bought for £100,000 or £200,000 a decade ago is now worth £10 million, hardly needs tax designation. It will take a different view of deprived areas.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if anybody in this House has ever negotiated much but in the on-going negotiations on Agenda 2000, everyone is playing hardball and is arguing about money. People are looking at Ireland which has moved from a debt GDP ratio of 120 per cent to a current budget deficit of 10 per cent. We have moved from enormous Exchequer borrowing requirements to one of the lowest in the Community. Given that we have knocked about 70 points off our GDP ratio in the past decade, the EU will not be as generous with resources.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals were published in the summer of 1997 following consideration by the last Government. They were published during the election campaign and we got 50 per cent of what we had in the last round. We broadly supported those proposals. People are trying to reduce those figures again but we resist and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might get it. A letter will issue to EUROSTAT today which will deal with the issues raised. It will provide clarification in areas where EUROSTAT is acting under misapprehension. Areas that have the EU average wealth should be entitled to Objective One status. Some Members seem to believe no area should come under Objective One status. The Commission would like to ensure that no area, with the exception of Devon and Cornwall, should be allowed Objective One status after the next round. We are totally opposed to that view. These areas have no possibility of having more than 65 per cent of EU average wealth after 2007. We should fight to ensure the west and the Border regions remain in Objective One status. I will continue to do that. The figures justify that, otherwise we would be negotiating in a very negative position. When I watch the position adopted by politicians in other countries in defence of these issues as opposed to what happens here, it is rather sad.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's second question, I think Ireland will get an equitable deal. I understand the position of our colleagues in Europe when they look at the economics, the surpluses and the growth rates. However, they understand the infrastructural deficit and are not unreasonable. They will listen to reasonable arguments. If we argued that we should hold what we have &ndash; we are not attempting to do that &ndash; we would get nowhere. We have accepted from the outset that we are likely to get about half what we got in the past. That was a reasonable position for us to put. With growth rates of 10 per cent when the Community has growth rates of 2 per cent we cannot expect other countries to provide the same resources as when we had negative growth not long ago. That is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Agriculture, particularly the dairy and beef sectors, would be devastated if the proposals on the table were accepted. We are arguing that case with some force. Dairy and beef accounts for 80 per cent of our agricultural output. We export 90 per cent of our beef, which is half of the export surplus into the EU. To ignore that point would be wrong. Every meeting I have had with every head of state, including a long telephone conversation with Gerhard Schröder indicates they understand that and we have to find an equitable solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Agenda 2000 proposals do not include specific proposals for the sheepmeat sector, the proposals to change the method for calculating stocking density for the extensification premium in the beef sector area have implications for sheep producers. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has already raised this issue in the course of the negotiations on Agenda 2000, with a view to ensuring that whatever arrangements are adopted for the extensification premium do not impact adversely on the sheep sector. He has sought for some time the introduction of an extensification premium for the sheep sector but the EU Commission has not acceded to his request on the grounds that the cost of such a premium, in the Union as a whole, would not be justified as sheep production is already an extensive operation. The Commission also sees the existence of the rural world premium, which is paid to producers in disadvantaged areas, as taking the place of an extensification payment.</P>
      <P>Securing the best deal possible for the sheepmeat sector will remain my concern during these talks. In the course of the preparation for the Agenda 2000 negotiations the Minister availed of every opportunity to put Ireland's case in a series of bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and his colleagues in the Council.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that both the Minister of State and his senior colleague understand the problems of the 46,000 Irish sheep farmers? If the extensification system goes ahead as currently proposed, farm animals will be counted as units but in the case of sheep they will not be paid for and even the best sheep farms will not be able to keep lowland sheep. Will the Minister of State put on record that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will put the sheep regime at the heart of this week's negotiations in Brussels, so that nothing will be accepted until that question is dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support on television recently for the Minister and the Irish position. We are aware that if support for meat dropped by 30 per cent it would put tremendous pressure on the sheepmeat sector in particular. We have argued that extensification for sheep would be an easier way to get the proper level of production and support for the farmers concerned and would bring about a more measured response in that area. The Commission does not look at it that way; it argues that the rural world premium is extensification by another name. While there is no mention of sheep reform in Agenda 2000, the Deputy can be assured that the <Col N="67" /> Minister will raise it as a priority in this week's discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, we lag far behind our European partners in special ewe premium payments &ndash; French and Belgian farmers get far more for their lamb, despite the same special ewe premium being paid to all farmers across Europe. We are at a huge disadvantage. I accept that sheep are not involved in the CAP discussions but the knock-on effect of the proposals would be to wipe out the sector. On behalf of every sheep farmer in the country, I ask that the Minister not agree to anything unless this matter is resolved to Ireland's satisfaction. This must be one of our main negotiating planks because it is vitally important that the sheep industry is not side-stepped in Brussels on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made clear that he is determined to take a strong line in his talks and he specifically raised the sheepmeat issue because it is not on the agenda. We are aware that mixing sheep and beef farmers would drastically affect the position of sheep farmers. The Deputy will be aware that the rural world premium price is decided on as a European average, as previously negotiated. It does not particularly suit us but it may balance out over time. The Deputy can be assured that the Minister and his officials regard this as of prime importance, because we are aware that it is mostly small farmers who will be hit.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, is currently examining objectively based grading systems being developed in other countries, specifically Denmark, Germany, France and Australia. An officer of my Department with an industry delegation visited Denmark in August 1998 to examine the operation of the BCC-2 system. The intention is to establish trials in Ireland with a view to examining the applicability of an objective system in Irish conditions. Until such time as these trials are completed and the system has been evaluated, no decision can be taken as to the introduction of a mechanical grading system at factory level. None of the mechanical grading systems being evaluated has yet been granted approval by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>In extremely adverse economic circumstances, particularly for the beef industry, a view is abroad that a more severe approach is being taken to the grading of cattle slaughtered at beef processing plants. Does the Minister agree that the key issues in grading are consistency and uniformity, and that where subjective standards apply it is not possible to achieve the required levels? Is he satisfied that the standards applied at all beef processing premises are standard and uniform? Farmers have 24 hours to appeal a grading assessment &ndash; did the Department furnish the appeal documentation to the factories, as promised to me in the Dáil on 16 December?</P>
      <P>I note that the objective, high-technology grading systems in Denmark, Australia and Germany were visited by a Department official. Has the Minister of State, who has a lot of practical knowledge, not gone there himself? I ask that he do so because this is a major issue for farmers. Every penny counts if one has a beef bullock, and the difference is significant, as the Minister knows.

As the national agency for research and development, Teagasc is carrying out work in this area. I do not know what system will be put in place.</P>
      <P>I have not visited any factories where the mechanical system is in place but I am considering looking at one or two of them, those which would be most opportune for Ireland to introduce.

My Department, in consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, is currently in the process of preparing detailed commonage framework plans. These plans will set out the percentage level of destocking, if any, required in individual commonages. Priority is being given to preparing framework plans for those commonages in the six western counties which were the subject of the 1998 ewe supplementary measure.</P>
      <P>While it is accepted that in some cases farmers retain sheep in excess of quota and under the existing sheep headage scheme farmers may qualify for payment on up to 200 sheep, the position is that under Agenda 2000 proposals it is proposed to change the existing disadvantaged areas headage schemes from a production linked model to an area based payment. In effect, therefore, from next year onwards, sheep farmers will be entitled to payment under the ewe premium scheme up to the limit of their quota and it is likely that they will also be entitled to an area based payment under the disadvantaged areas headage scheme.

      <P>During 1998 the roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for the transport of live animals <Col N="72" /> was significantly augmented by the carriage of cattle on designated vessels. There are now 15 such vessels approved by my Department to carry cattle from Ireland. All these vessels can carry cattle to continental Europe, while 11 of them are also approved to carry cattle to the Middle East.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased by the resurgence in live exports of cattle in 1998, with up to 170,000 cattle exported from Ireland to the Continent and third countries. There has been a very significant growth in live cattle exports to the Continent, with over 140,000 head exported to this market alone. This is the highest number in years and represents a sixfold increase over exports in 1997.</P>

      <P>There is a perception abroad that obstacles were recently placed in the way of exports of live cattle. Is it true that a cattle boat was recently obliged to leave an Irish port with no animals on board? Is it true that the same boat was loaded with cattle from another European country a number of days later? Everyone wants proper standards and rules &ndash; they were agreed in the House in respect of the regulations &ndash; to apply to the care, etc. of animals. Is Ireland stricter in its application of those standards and rules than its European counterparts? Countries which are less dependent on live exports than Ireland do not seem to have the same problem. Do we take a more strict approach or are obstacles being placed in the way of the live trade? Was a threat recently made to take away one of our ships?</P>

We recognise the importance of the live trade to the Irish cattle industry and no obstacles will be put in the way of any ship, provided it meets the stability requirements. I categorically assure the House that no official in my Department in any way hinders the licensing of ships in order to inhibit or interfere with live exports.

      <P>Under the common organisation of the pigmeat market the only market support measures fully funded by the EU budget are export refunds and aids to private storage. In the short-term Ireland has pressed for the maximum use of existing supports to address the current weakness in the market. In view of the current <Col N="73" /> imbalance between supply and demand and the downward pressure this is having on producer income, there is a case for some form of supply management to be considered.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the position in the Deputy's part of the country. I have had meetings there, as has the Minister. The pigmeat sector is not covered by the Common Agricultural Policy in terms of supports. I can give no guarantees that the provision of slaughtering facilities will be grant-aided. On the information available from Forbairt, there is sufficient capacity available on the island. A catastrophe in another part of the island &ndash; a major fire in County Antrim &ndash; has caused problems in the Deputy's area. If the sector is to survive, there will have to be continuity of supply and different arrangements between producers and processors. There is a need to put an integrated system in place. We are dealing with a perishable product. I am here to defend the sector, not just processors.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said that supply management could be considered. Does he agree that the policy instruments being considered as part of the CAP reforms will be in place until 2006? Is his Department taking an initiative regarding supply management at EU level, in the context of the ongoing negotiations, to ensure pig producers, especially the 300 family farm units, have an income?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State outlined the steps the Minister has taken since the crisis erupted. Will he agree, however, it has not put a penny on the price of bacon to the producers? Following negotiations at EU level, his predecessor had the capacity to deliver on the sole instrument &ndash; the slaughter levy &ndash; that would at least put £1 on every pig for the producer. Does the Minister of State accept his actions to date have meant nothing to producers and that to ensure as many family units as possible survive, he must at least deliver on the slaughter levy in the context of the negotiations in Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals before the working groups include a reduction in the slaughter rates and an early market payment to producers for a three month period only; more reliable means of measuring and evaluating pigmeat market parameters; more frequent livestock surveys and more co-ordination of EUROSTAT and national surveys to give early warning signs of trouble &ndash; when the numbers start to grow; penalties for exceeding producer and milk quotas; intervention for piglets; reducing sow numbers, including a cull sow scheme &ndash; a French proposal; postponing inseminations to reduce the numbers; creation of a solidarity fund by levying farmers on the price of goods to support them in bad times &ndash; a kind of stabilisation fund; harmonisation of environmental regulations in each member state &ndash; each regulation is a cost on producers and non-implementation gives them an advantage; and a buyout scheme for pig producers. These involve supply management. The EU Commission is considering them but has not produced any response, and I cannot say if it will. However, the indications from the management meeting yesterday are for an upward trend in prices. I cannot say whether this will cover the costs of production, but the trend is in favour of the pig producer.</P>

Following a tour of pig farms throughout the country, is the Minister of State going to stand back until the position rectifies itself?

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if the supply of pigmeat under the Russian food aid scheme has eased any of the problems facing Irish suppliers; the plans, if any, he has to alleviate some of the current difficulties in the pigmeat sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU food aid package for Russia includes a provision for the supply of 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. The supply of this meat is to be decided by means of a tendering system, which is open to operators on a community wide basis. The deadline for tendering for the first tranche of 30,000 tonnes is 8 March 1999. The supply of 100,000 tonnes of product from the EU market is expected to have a positive effect, given the current oversupply and consequent weakness in prices to producers.</P>
      <P>I have taken a number of important measures to alleviate the current problems in the sector. In 1998 I succeeded in gaining agreement from the Commission for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date more than 200,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been temporarily removed from the market throughout the Community. Ireland has more than 1,000 tonnes of pigmeat in storage under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> On a number of occasions last year, I also secured substantial increases in the level of export refunds. A further increase in refunds was agreed in February 1999. These increases have been of considerable help to exporters and, in conjunction with a number of other member states, I am continuing to press for EU action to help the situation for producers. This action includes improved market support as well as action related to supply control to address the more general supply-demand imbalance which underlies the market weakness at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Minister of State's deep involvement in the pig industry, what impact does he anticipate this tender for 30,000 tonnes will have on prices? What impact had the aids to private storage scheme on prices? It appears to have had a negligible impact on export refunds. Is it his view that this is the way to help the pig industry or is there an alternative method of ensuring that moneys he fought hard for and won at ministerial level will end up in the producers' pockets rather than elsewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>We envisaged that both schemes would take a certain amount of pigmeat off the market, which arose from a surplus. That did not happen. Nevertheless, we continued with the schemes and continued negotiations at European level, including at the Council of Ministers and management meetings to make the schemes more friendly to the processor to encourage them to put more pigmeat in storage. Since approximately 1 January the tendency has been for producers to take up some of the schemes and make them work in their favour. We cannot make them do this. They live in a free society and we have no power over them. Given that the schemes are now working, there is a trend towards increased prices for pigmeat. That is the view of the EU as of yesterday.</P>

      <P>The so-called clean livestock policy is set out in the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Veterinary Examination) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998. These regulations were introduced in February 1998 and extended the grounds under which a veterinary inspector may declare an animal unfit for slaughter for human consumption to include the condition of the hide, fleece or skin of an animal. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure that the condition of the hide, fleece or skin of the animal is not such as, when slaughtered, to risk contamination of the carcase, thereby creating a risk to public health.</P>
      <P>On delivery to a factory animals are categorised into five groups. Depending on the category, cattle may either be accepted, require certain dressing procedures or be rejected for slaughter. Rejected cattle may be re-presented when they are ready for slaughter. There is no requirement for cattle to be clipped.</P>
      <P>Colour posters depicting the different categories have been widely distributed for display at meat plants, livestock marts, district veterinary offices, Teagasc advisory centres and local abattoirs. Meat plants should, through their agents, be able to advise farmers on the condition of their animals when they visit farms to select animals for slaughter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment for cattle is primarily a matter between meat processors and producers. However, I have expressed disappointment on a number of occasions in the past about the flat pricing system which had been adopted <Col N="80" /> by the meat processors until recently. I understand the main reason for this approach is that following the BSE scares of 1996, the main market for Irish beef is in third countries, where a premium is not placed on high quality beef. The recovery of EU markets will be helped by a greater emphasis on the production of high quality cattle which can come about only when a quality based payment structure is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>In view of this, I am pleased that, following discussions between my Department, the meat processors and the IFA last year, most meat processors have moved to a quality based pricing system with premium prices being paid for better quality cattle. It is important that this trend is maintained. The task force on the beef industry, which the Minister set up at the end of last year, is examining what further needs to be done in this regard.</P>

      <P>A number of years ago EU regulations were introduced which stated that any animal availing of suckler cow premia had to be of a beef breed. This contributed to improving the profile of the Irish beef animal. Does the Minister of State agree the next logical step is to ensure all beef cow animals are in calf to beef breeds as this would help to upgrade the quality of the beef herd? Has he any proposals to intensify the use of artificial insemination in suckler cow herds?

      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions which are outside the sphere of this parliamentary question and, therefore, I do not have the information. The quality of beef deteriorated during 1994, 1995 and 1996 when we had high levels of live exports and Holstein exports. Holstein cattle at that time were making more than the prime breeds of continentals, such as Charolais, Limousin and Simmentals. I will circulate the classification results to interested Deputies.</P>
      <P>We encourage artificial insemination because it is the best way forward for the industry. Some 46 per cent of the dairy herd is artificially inseminated. I do not know what percentage of the suckler herd is artifically inseminated.</P>

      <P>We will have to consider an animal breeding policy if we want to identify with the European markets, particularly the French and Italian markets, which are the most lucrative. We sell 20,000 tonnes of beef to Italy which has a market for 400,000 tonnes. This beef must be of good quality; it must have white fat and pinkish red meat. It must be grain fed to a certain extent to obtain that colour. Pasture fed animals produce meat with a deep red colour. The French market is different. We must concentrate on the French and Italian markets as well as the UK market which is similar to our own.</P>

We have failed to differentiate in favour of particular beef progeny thus ensuring the utilisation of specialised beef breeding bulls. I have called for this since I came into the House in 1992.

I do not know whether legislation will be necessary or if this council can be set up by way of an order under existing legislation. We have commenced work in this regard and we hope some progress will be made in the next six to eight weeks. This is an important area. The Deputy referred to non-compliance. I am not aware if that has been the case, although with the number of schemes in existence it is likely that difficulties have arisen.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I was dealing with the issue of the new farm assist scheme. Section 15 provides a new allowance which will be payable to farmers aged between 18 and 66 who satisfy the means test. The maximum rate of the payment will be equivalent to the long-term rate of unemployment assistance which <Col N="85" /> next June will be £73.50. Increases for qualified adults and child dependants will be provided on a similar basis as for social welfare payments generally. Income from capital will be assessed on the same basis as for other long-term social assistance payments.</P>
      <P>Section 16 provides for the assessment of means for entitlement to the new payment. Under this section the farmer's net income from self-employment, including farming, will be assessed at a rate of 80 per cent instead of on a pound for pound basis as currently applies under the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme. In addition, in the case of a farm family, an amount of £100 per annum for each of the first two children and £200 for each subsequent child will be disregarded when assessing the net income from the farm.</P>
      <P>The budget allocation for a full year was an additional £15 million on to the existing smallholders' scheme which, at last count, was in the region of £33 million.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Government provided an extra £5 million in the current year in order to allow for payments under the farm assist scheme from the first week of April 1999. This issue has been raised by members of my own parliamentary party. It is the view of the House generally that once this Bill passes and the scheme is available, application forms and explanatory memoranda in relation to the scheme should be available almost immediately. We are doing our level best in the Department to ensure that is the case. Obviously, we cannot second guess what ultimately will occur when the legislation is passed and whether or not it is to be amended in this regard. However, we are doing our utmost, in view of the urgency of the situation, to have everything up and ready so that this scheme can start in the first week of April.</P>
      <P>To allow for necessary means testing and other preparatory work, the first payments, including arrears, will be made sometime in the first week of June. An additional £5 million has already been allocated to the scheme in 1999, bringing the total allocation for the year to £10 million.</P>
      <P>Because the farm assist scheme is being introduced shortly, I have already decided that the signing on arrangements for smallholder's assistance are being suspended for those who now apply to seek a review of their existing claim. Any person thereby qualifying for smallholder's assistance will be transferred automatically to the new farm assist scheme with effect from June next, and will have their additional entitlements under the new scheme backdated to the first week of April. This was decided by the Government subsequent to the announcement of this scheme in the budget, in order to react positively to the difficulties in the farming sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, applications for smallholder's assistance will be taken as an application for the new scheme for those who fail to qualify for smallholder's assistance but who may be entitled to some payment under the farm assist scheme. <Col N="86" /> Application forms for the new scheme will be available from my Department's offices in March.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides for the introduction of a bereavement grant to replace the existing death grant scheme. I have secured an additional £10 million from the Government to improve this scheme, which was introduced in 1970 to alleviate the cost of funeral expenses. I was interested to note that on an RTE programme recently, Pat Kenny, who is well known for his knowledge in all matters, did not even know there was such a thing as a death grant. I suppose that would indicate that the general public does not know what a death grant is either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not too many qualify for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 10,000 such grants are payable each year at a cost of £1 million to the social insurance fund. We are increasing this by £10 million to bring it to an annual spend of £11 million in one fell swoop. The maximum grant currently payable is £100 and a reduced grant of £95 is payable where the contribution conditions are partially satisfied. The new section 19 provides for three significant improvements in the scheme. First it provides for a substantial increase from £100 to £500 in the level of the grant. The last such increase was made in April 1982. Members will agree that this represents a really worthwhile contribution towards funeral expenses incurred by families. Under section 4, I am providing that the amount of the funeral grant payable under the occupational injuries scheme will also be increased to £500.</P>
      <P>Second, I am extending the scope of the scheme to include other insured persons such as the self-employed and people covered by the modified rate of social insurance, for example &ndash; I am happy to say &ndash; public servants. At present the scheme is largely confined to employees who pay the full rate of PRSI contribution. It makes no sense that people in such categories as I mentioned earlier cannot qualify for a death grant but may qualify for a widow's or widower's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Third, I am proposing a substantial easement of the contribution conditions so that as many people as possible can qualify under the scheme. The present conditions require the insured person to have a minimum of 26 contributions paid since starting work or since 1 October 1970, and to have either 48 contributions paid or credited in a recent income tax year or an average of 48 contributions per year since October 1970 or since starting work, if later. The grant should be payable to insured people with a minimum level of contributions paid under the social insurance system. In addition, I am proposing that a grant be payable automatically on the death of a person receiving a contributory pension or deserted wife's benefit, his or her spouse or qualified dependants, a person receiving orphan's contributory allowance, or his or her guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> I will also introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for even further easement in the contribution conditions for entitlement. These new arrangements will operate from the first week of April and will cost £10 million in a full year. The additional cost is being met fully out of the social insurance fund. In our election manifesto we promised we would do something in the area of bereavement and we proposed certain changes in the social welfare system in this regard. I have gone in a slightly different direction to what we promised in our election manifesto and in the programme for Government. I have done so because it is probably the more acceptable way and will bring money to people at one of the most difficult times of their lives. I commend this change to the House. I thank my Government colleagues for allowing this additional cost of £10 million in a full year to be put into this scheme. It will now be called the bereavement grant instead of the death grant, as it was termed heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the payment of a special rate of old age contributory pension to certain self-employed persons who were aged 56 years or over on 6 April 1988 when social insurance was extended to this group. The Government is delivering on the commitment made to this group in our election manifesto by introducing a special rate of contributory pension for those with at least five years' paid contributions since that date. This is delivering on something we promised when we were in Opposition. Other parties in the House spoke about this when in Opposition but did nothing about it when they were in Government. We are doing what we can in this regard.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to the new pension will begin from the first week in April but payments will not be made until October. This allows my Department to examine all the relevant claims and to ensure that refunds of contributions made to more than 3,000 contributors in this group are recouped. Any arrears of payment due will be issued in October. The new pension will be payable at 50 per cent of the maximum personal rate, plus 50 per cent of appropriate increases for qualified adults and child dependants, where applicable. We estimate that up to 10,000 people &ndash; 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults &ndash; will benefit from this measure at an estimated additional cost of over £18 million.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to old age and retirement pensions will be undertaken by my Department this year. I am doing this in response to representations from all sides of the House, including my own parliamentary party's sub-committee which deals with social welfare areas.</P>
    <P>Particular attention will be given to the yearly average test. It will also deal with the treatment of pre-1953 contributions and the commitment given in the programme for Government to allow women who take time out for family reasons, to <Col N="88" /> continue contributions for pensions purposes. I will report back to the House when the review is completed.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for new arrangements under the unemployment assistance scheme aimed at benefiting low income fishermen. The new arrangements, which will be known as fishing assist, represent a substantial response from the Government to the difficulties experienced, during periods of prolonged bad weather, by fishermen who operate out of small boats right around our coastal communities. The new provisions involve changes to the means test for unemployment assistance including 80 per cent of all income from self-employment being assessed instead of 100 per cent as at present, child related disregards of £100 per annum for each of the first two qualified children and £200 per annum for each subsequent child and a relaxation of the signing on arrangements. An additional £1 million is being made available on a full year basis for these new arrangements which will take effect from the first week of April.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that lone parents who are temporarily absent from the State for less than 12 months will continue to retain their entitlement to social assistance under the former schemes of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance. I will introduce a further provision on Committee Stage dealing with the continued entitlement of certain people to deserted wife's benefit. On a sad note, I should mention that I brought forward this amendment, having been prompted by a parliamentary question tabled by the late Deputy Upton a few weeks ago. I take this opportunity to extend my condolence to his wife and family.</P>
    <P>Section 26 strengthens the powers of social welfare inspectors to allow them to remove or secure for later inspection documents or records from employers' premises and to require employers to provide reasonable explanations of their contents. These additional powers will facilitate inspectors in making sure employers are meeting their PRSI obligations and that their employees are not concurrently working and claiming social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 26 also makes specific provision for an inspector exercising his or her statutory powers, accompanied by a Garda in uniform, to stop any vehicle he or she reasonably suspects is being used for the purpose of employment or self-employment and to make inquiries of any persons in such a vehicle or require them to produce any record in their possession in connection with their employment or business.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, at the invitation of the Garda, my Department and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Environment and Local Government and the Revenue Commissioners participated at checkpoints in Counties Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Monaghan, Cavan, Louth and Meath. Some people said they had not heard about these checkpoints, but they were widely publicised in the media during the <Col N="89" /> past year. These checkpoints have largely focused on commercial vehicles or those used in the course of employment or self-employment. From my Department's perspective, it is primarily aimed at people who may be concurrently working and claiming social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>As a result of follow up by social welfare officers in respect of these multi-agency checkpoints, to date a total of 118 social welfare claims were disallowed giving savings of £350,000. In addition, the Garda and Customs detected a number of road traffic, road transport and customs offences. This approach has been very effective in detecting serious levels of fraud and abuse. For example, one checkpoint in February last year detected no less than 10 per cent of fraud cases in 100 vehicles checked. A number of cases involving people from Northern Ireland are being followed up through the normal liaison arrangements with the social security agency there.</P>
    <P>To date social welfare inspectors operated under general powers contained in existing legislation, namely, section 212(3)(d). I have been advised that it would be more appropriate to replace these existing general powers with more specific provisions. Concern was expressed by some Members about the exercise of such powers, but I assure the House these powers will continue to be used responsibly.</P>
    <P>This programme is not aimed at ordinary citizens going about their business. Some Members pontificate as if they are the only people who represent the ordinary people. Ordinary citizens are being ripped off by defrauders, including social welfare defrauders. It is those in most need, old age pensioners, carers, widows, lone parents and the unemployed, who lose out by this. I make no apology for doing all I can to stamp out fraud in the social welfare system. Every £1 taken in fraud means there is £1 less for the needy in our society.</P>
    <P>Surely those who find fault with the multi-agency effort to detect fraud are not asking us to turn a blind eye to what we all know is going on. If so, they are being hypocritical in the extreme. Fraud is fraud. Those most vocal on this cannot have it both ways. These powers will only work if they are used in a sensible and responsible manner. I can assure the House that is the way they will be operated under my stewardship and that is how they were operated in the past.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Department of Health and Children, section 27 extends the scope of the legislative provisions I introduced last year for an integrated social services system to include the General Medical Services Payments Board and the voluntary hospitals operating in the health services area. Deputies will recall that the provisions introduced last year provided for the standardisation of the RSI number as a unique public service identifier, the introduction of a public service card and a payment card and the sharing and transfer of personal information between specified public bodies for the purposes of determining entitlement to certain social services and for the <Col N="90" /> control of such services, of which six were specified.</P>
    <P>The General Medical Services Payments Board and 28 voluntary hospitals are now being added to the existing list of specified bodies. That list includes Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, the Revenue Commissioners, FÁS, An Post, the GRO and the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>My Department consulted a wide range of specified bodies on how the new system will work. Plans are well advanced to launch a combined PPSN and public service card initiative across the public service in 1999 to heighten public awareness of the potential it offers for improved service delivery. This initiative will include the development of a common means database accessible to agencies delivering means tested public service schemes. It will also explore ways the public service card could help achieve greater integration of public services, better access for individuals and for its adoption as a payment card.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Education and Science, Agriculture and Food and local authorities expressed a keen interest in implementing it in the near future. The Department of Health and Children has plans for the voluntary hospitals to use the number for patient records and screening programmes. The GMS Board will use it for the creation of a national patient index in the consolidated drug subsidisation scheme. All data-sharing will obviously be governed by the existing legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 include two important provisions dealing with the handling of social welfare claims by the CAB. Officers of the Minister currently working in the bureau have the power to investigate and determine entitlement to social welfare payment in claims made by people involved in criminal activity. The identity of these officers is protected under the relevant legislation. Under existing legislation, civil proceedings can only be brought at the suit of the Minister or initiated by an authorised officer of the Minister. The identity of such officers is not protected under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act. Section 28 is designed to provide that civil proceedings in such cases can be taken by the bureau.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that an appeal to the Circuit Court in social welfare cases dealt with by the bureau must be submitted within 21 days from the date of notification of the chief appeals officer's direction in this matter. A similar time limit currently applies to appeals to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce a further provision on Committee Stage to provide the bureau officers with the powers to investigate and determine entitlements to supplementary welfare allowance payments in cases made by people involved in criminal activity. At present such claims are processed only by the health boards and the provision will address concerns about the present <Col N="91" /> levels of protection of their staff in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for an increase in the health contribution from 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent and for an increase in the weekly exemption threshold from £207 to £217 from 6 April next. Section 33 repeals the relevant provisions underpinning the 1 per cent employment and training levy which, as announced in the budget, is being abolished from 6 April next. The net effect of this will be an overall reduction of 0.25 per cent in the levies.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the issue of integration, the process whereby occupational pensions effectively top up the social welfare pension to provide a total pension specified in the rules of the occupational pension scheme, and I referred to this issue on a number of occasions, most recently in my budget speech last December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Integration is normally on a once-off basis at the point of retirement, but in a small number of pension schemes, the process is continued on an ongoing basis after retirement under a &ldquo;total pension income&rdquo; approach, which is provided for in the rules of these schemes.</P>
      <P>In considering any reforms in this area, I have to bear in mind that occupational pension schemes are voluntary arrangements. Nevertheless, I consider that certain reforms in this area are warranted, and as a first step, I am providing that any reduction in occupational pensions in payment, as a result of increases in the social welfare pension, will be prohibited.</P>
      <P>While there is little, if any, evidence that any pension scheme rules allow for such a reduction, the prohibition will obviously outlaw such a practice if it exists, and will also prevent any employers considering such a rule in the future. Such a prohibition was recommended by the Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative.</P>
      <P>On the general issue of post-retirement integration, I have decided it should best be examined in the overall context of a review of the indexation of occupational pensions generally and I have requested the Pensions Board to prepare a report on this. I will consider the board's report and revisit the specific issue of post-retirement integration in the context of the Pensions Bill, which I hope to publish later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last election we promised to do three things; to cut taxes, crime and dole queues. We have succeeded dramatically in all three, for example, a major reform of the taxation system was announced in this year's budget by standard rating the basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowance. The full <Col N="92" /> year value of the main personal reliefs amounts to £581 million. Crime has been cut by some 16 per cent and the live register has dropped by more than 45,000 since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The employment action plan which we launched in September is having a significant effect. The numbers signing off from the live register have increased significantly since it was introduced. A key focus of the Government is providing training and education both for unemployed people generally and for people who are long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to looking after the needs of our older people, carers and others who are dependent on the social welfare system for income support. This is clearly evident when one considers the additional resources being made available for these improvements &ndash; £192 million this year and £317 million in a full year. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I do not wish any disrespect to the House, but I have to leave promptly to attend the funeral service for the late Deputy Pat Upton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's position and wish I too could attend. However, the business of the House must go on under the circumstances. I join the Minister in extending my sympathy to Mrs. Upton and her family on the sudden and tragic death of the late Deputy Upton. We were his friends and will all miss him sorely.</P>
      <P>For the first time in our history we have the means to help the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;, to improve the lot of the disadvantaged and to tackle poverty. In 1999, we are budgeting for a current surplus of £2,300 million, a figure which, based on previous understatements, will probably be substantially exceeded. In contrast, the additional moneys from the Exchequer over and above the pre-budget social affairs' Estimate, amount to a mere £77.9 million. Clearly we are not using the resources available to us to make any significant impact on the quality of life of the half of our society which is not benefiting from the Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill provides the opportunity to cater for the poorer half of society. While there are some good provisions in this Bill, an historic opportunity has been missed. It galls me a little to hear the smug self-satisfaction of the Minister when he spoke about increasing rates of payment by a few pounds when he clearly does not realise the huge spread of poverty in our society, unaffected by the boom which has contributed so much to the wealth of the upper half of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are lies, damned lies and statistics; the Minister mentioned £381 million which is a ridiculous figure; an extra £381 million will not be spent from the Exchequer in the current year. That is a fact on which I challenge the Minister. We are not discussing this year's expenditure; we <Col N="93" /> are discussing the 1999 Bill and expenditure for 1999. The 1999 budget statistics and tables state that the additional expenditure from the Exchequer for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs post-budget is £77, 930, 000. How can we explain that?</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons. However, it is clear that the social insurance fund is now in surplus. The credits of the outgoing social insurance fund last year came to £53.3 million. We are not talking about extra Exchequer funds if we are paying increases on contributory pensions or contributory payments of any kind. Those are paid, not by the Government but through it, from the social insurance fund, out of the contributions of the workers. It is a great position to be in. In the hard times of the past, contributions from the Exchequer had to be paid into the social insurance fund. Now it is in surplus. However, the Minister should not claim any credit for the moneys being paid from the social insurance fund to which the workers contributed.</P>
    <P>I reiterate how an historic opportunity has been missed. We are at a crossroads. Are we to use the available moneys to make a decent impact on poverty in our society? That is the test which confronted this Government when it was compiling the 1999 figures. It flunked, because the modest moneys allocated to the Minister for 1999 will make no impact of any consequence. This is not the first year that money was available. However it is the first year there was an admission in advance that money was available. Money was available last year but the cautious Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, projected a deficit of £89 million.</P>
    <P>That he ended up with a substantial surplus is a scéal eile. However, from the beginning, he projected a deficit. It is different this year; now there is a projection of a current budget surplus of £2,300 million. There is even a projection of an Exchequer surplus of £925 million, taking capital expenditure into account. On a net basis, even going by the Minister's cautious estimates, there will be £925 million extra at the end of the year; I guarantee this figure will be substantially exceeded.</P>
    <P>We must align the allocations made by the Minister in the Social Welfare Bill against this and put them in perspective. There has been a miserable effort to deal with the problems of the disadvantaged in our society. There is no point in the Minister replying that the figures are higher than in other years. They should be. That is a starting point. There is a great deal more money around and the Exchequer is stuffed to the gills. What answers can we give to the poor, the disabled, and those who have an inadequate standard of living, when the Government is like Croesus and is prepared to let only the crumbs from the table fall to them? There is no answer. I do not believe this Government has a full understanding of the poverty in our society or any feeling for the disadvantaged when it trumpets the <Col N="94" /> miserable few pounds being given in this Bill as being of consequence to the disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hugely disappointed. According to figures from the Combat Poverty Agency, which operates directly under the Department and is not a loose cannon, one-third of all children in Ireland live in poverty. Its report also states that we have the second highest rate of child poverty in the European Union and that it is increasing. The Minister may say in reply, and I could write the script for him, that that is based on figures in 1994 and that things have changed since then. Perhaps the situation has improved slightly but they have not improved to the extent that the basic statistics produced by the Combat Poverty Agency have substantially changed. There is substantial poverty, in particular child poverty. Experts agree the best response to child poverty is to increase substantially child benefit payments and child care provision. We have more than one million children, one-third of whom are living in poverty according to the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>The provision of good quality affordable child care is a problem. The demand for child care places is expected to rocket by up to 50 per cent during the next 12 years, yet child care costs swallow a higher percentage of the average salary in Ireland than in any other member state. It is usually the lower paid who are affected. The professional couple, where both parents may not work for economic reasons, will be hit to some degree but they will survive while the lower paid will be more substantially affected by the high cost of child care. We can make a significant contribution to the resolution of child poverty and the child care issue by substantially increasing child benefit, in particular for children under five years.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Bruton, touched on this in his Ard Fheis speech when he spoke about increasing child benefit to £20 per week for children up to the age of five years. This is quite feasible and could be done tomorrow because the Exchequer has the resources. This would apply to about 250,000 children, a percentage of whom will be on the higher level already, and the cost would be less than £150 million in a full year. What changes have been made in child benefit in this Bill? The Minister has trumpeted his achievements but the only thing he has done for children is to increase child benefit by 28p per week when the Government will have a surplus of thousands of millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to suggest that is a miserable response to the problems of child poverty. Of course an increase in child benefit will not solve the problem of the provision of child care. The Government received the national child care strategy report. I recognise that the terms of reference of that report are not directed at parents <Col N="95" /> who choose to care for their own children so the report does not cover every situation, but allowing for that its 27 recommendations are comprehensive and detailed and cover a range of areas. It took into account that 58 per cent of mothers who work full time outside the home avail of child care while 16 per cent of mothers who work in the home avail of child care. It is predicted that these numbers will rise substantially and we must be ready for that. The Government has kicked to touch and flunked the test. I know there are difficulties and there is the controversial question whether we should use a tax base approach, but the Government has done nothing. The increase of 28p per week in child benefit is unacceptable given that so much money is available.</P>
    <P>Another controversial issue is the question of check-point patrols. The Fine Gael Party is against fraud, as I am, but the proposals in the Bill for additional powers to enforce social welfare laws are too draconian. In an era of falling unemployment, social welfare inspectors are being given the blunt instrument of check-point patrols which can be exercised in a random fashion. It is fine for the Minister to say how carefully the powers will be exercised but it will not be the Minister who will exercise them once they are in place. Those who exercise these powers will not be constrained in any way by legislation and the powers will be exercised in a random fashion. It is clear from the Minister's statement when he spoke about pilot projects that they have been exercised in a random fashion. Thousands of vehicles have been stopped in a random fashion to produce the results about which he spoke. Any vehicle can be stopped and the person in the vehicle questioned. There is a danger that the individual's rights and liberties will be breached and that these powers amount to an assault on people's rights to privacy and confidentiality in their dealings with the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for new statutory powers under section 26. One would have expected the Minister to have been forthcoming about these powers when circulating the Bill. I read the explanatory memorandum for an explanation of these new powers and whereas there is a reference to the inspection of premises, the check-point patrols are not mentioned. Is this subterfuge? Did the Minister think people would not notice this in the Bill? Will the Minister explain why the question of check-point patrols was not covered in the explanatory memorandum? When questioned about this issue the Minister sent out a civil servant to justify the power, however, if he were announcing an increase in benefit the civil servant would not be in the limelight. The Minister dodged the issue.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of pilot surveys that had taken place and the Minister was caught out. To justify including this power in the Bill, the Minister gave the numbers caught out in social welfare fraud as a result of pilot check-point patrols. <Col N="96" /> What was the statutory power for that? I notice the Minister tried to cover himself by saying that these things are being done at the invitation of the Garda Síochána. Is it a fact that the Garda Commissioner sent a begging letter to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs asking him to allow special check-points to be set up to trap people for social welfare fraud? That is unbelievable. The Minister owes us an explanation.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the Minister should accept that the power provided for in the Bill constitutes a bridge too far. It is a power that unnecessarily and unduly infringes on the liberty of the individual. Let us consider an example of a similar power in another legislative measure, the power of the gardaí to breathalyse people under the Road Traffic Act, 1994. A garda cannot breathalyse somebody at random. It is a serious offence. Under the 1994 Act, a garda can only breathalyse a person if the garda is of the opinion that the person has consumed intoxicating liquor. Even when dealing with that serious offence, there is a restriction on the use of that power by the Garda Síochána. Yet, this legislation gives social welfare inspectors the power to carry out random inspections and to unnecessarily interfere with the rights of citizens. They can also ignore confidentiality and privacy.</P>
    <P>A recent newspaper article made a good point in this regard which is worth mentioning. What happens if there are four people in the car that is stopped? Does the social welfare inspector question each of them when they are together? Is it fair to somebody who might be sensitive that they are unemployed or in some other disadvantaged situation to cross examine them in the presence of other people who might not even be aware of their position? This power has not been thoroughly considered and I wish to voice my objections to its introduction in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Each year's Social Welfare Bill should provide an opportunity to examine anomalies in the legislation and to remove them. I am amazed the Minister has not dealt with some glaring examples which I previously brought to his attention. One example, which I intend to deal with in detail on Committee Stage, is the problem for the old and disabled on non-contributory payments arising from Ireland's entry into the single currency and the consequent drop in interest rates. Does the public know that the Minister is assessing these people at 7.5 per cent interest in some instances and at up to 15 per cent interest on capital in the bank and using that false, notional figure to reduce their entitlement to non-contributory pensions? The Minister's refusal to change this iniquitous system is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are two major problems with this system. First, people in a weak and vulnerable position are being robbed by the Minister, which is indefensible. He talks about the problem of low interest rates and the fact that people who have <Col N="97" /> a great deal of capital will qualify for a pension. If he wishes to change the system and base it on capital, let us discuss that. However, if the system and the means test are based on income, he must play according to those rules. The way he is currently using the rules is hugely unfair to the pensioners and disabled people affected.</P>
    <P>The second problem is of even greater concern. I heard a priest from Achill recently talk about what he called &ldquo;the need to decommission the biscuit tin&rdquo;. Essentially, he was talking about the need to encourage people to take their money from under the bed or wherever it was hidden in the house and put it into the bank, credit union or post office. The Minister, by clinging to this unfair system, will encourage the reverse. It will cause not decommissioning but the recommissioning of biscuit tins. People will be fearful of putting money in banks and receiving 0.2 per cent interest only to be falsely assessed at earning either 7.5 per cent or 15 per cent by the Department when they claim their non-contributory entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am hugely disappointed at the delay of the Government in making progress on the national anti-poverty strategy which was introduced by the previous Government. There is enormous poverty in our society. According to the Combat Poverty Agency almost two-thirds of the economically poor live in rural areas. There is provision for farmers and fishermen in the Bill but it will not have an appreciable effect on the dreadful situation of many of them.</P>
    <P>I have proposed on many occasions &ndash; I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept it &ndash; that the family income supplement be extended to the self-employed, not just farmers. That is the case in the UK and Northern Ireland so why not here? In the past one could point out that there was not sufficient money to do that. However, there is now. Why not have a fair system for the poor self-employed? The Minister has given no justification for his refusal to introduce this measure.</P>
    <P>I have frequently spoken about, and I produced a policy document on, the dispersed and almost invisible poverty in rural Ireland. It contrasts starkly with the concentrated poverty in urban disadvantaged areas. Clearly, the objective must be to secure sustained social and economic development in order to improve the lives of the people in those areas through empowerment, a better quality of life, education, training and employment opportunities. What is in this Bill to help in achieving that objective? Nothing. The Government has made no progress and it has no policy designed to make an impact on urban social exclusion.</P>
    <P>There is no effort at fairness on the part of the Government in dealing with the problems of the disadvantaged. The money is available but the Government lacks the vision, the policies and the political will to make any impact. Fine Gael will oppose this Bill as an inadequate and insignificant <Col N="98" /> response to the need to create a fairer and more just society&mdash;</P>

      <P>Rubbish. Contributory pensioners do not get their money from the Government but from the social insurance fund. The effort of this Government, with a surplus of £2,300 million on its current account, is outrageous. The extra £77 million it has added to the Estimates to cater for the other half of society is miserable.</P>
      <P>The Minister thunders about his care for the carers. I have always been interested in the position of carers. It was I who tabled an amendment ten years ago to the Social Welfare Bill to pay the prescribed relative allowance, which was previously paid to the pensioner, directly to the carer. The amendment was accepted and that led to the introduction of the carer's allowance. I have followed the progress of the allowance with interest and there is a further improvement in the budget.</P>
      <P>A proposal which I have pushed for some time relates to payment for respite care and I welcome its introduction in this Bill. At £200, it is small but it is a start. However, there is a rub. It is only payable to qualifying carers. Only about 15,000 will qualify as carers. There are various estimates of the number of other carers which range from 30,000 to 100,000. Let us take an estimate of 50,000. They will continue to get nothing. I wish to press the Minister on a couple of issues. I presented this proposal initially on the basis of a respite care allowance payment to all carers. Why should all carers not receive a payment? They put the same effort into it and need the same relief. We should bear these 50,000 people in mind. We talk about the unsung heroes; we should give them some recognition rather than just talk about them. What happens to the person who gets the carer's allowance? It is counted as taxable income, giving rise to considerable difficulty for many people. The State is giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</P>
      <P>Pensions payable on a <i>pro rata </i>basis are not <i>pro rata</i> at all. People were bored to tears with my efforts to introduce <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those who were forced to make contributions and for the self-employed who, under the legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil, were excluded from any pension. I am glad progress has been made but half of those people will not qualify. There is also a rather mean twist to it. If my calculations are correct, the first pensionable self-employed came into existence in April 1998. Why should the <i>pro rata</i> pensions &ndash; perhaps I should call them half pensions &ndash; date from the same time? Why is the Government taking advantage of that year? The people who made the contributions should be entitled to their half pension from the time the first payments were issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> This Bill is entirely unacceptable. There are a few good things in it but it will make no impact whatsoever on the problems of the disadvantaged in our society.

I oppose this Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party for that reason.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that Deputy O'Keeffe does not welcome the introduction of the new <i>pro rata</i> pensions when he, his colleagues in Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left trooped in behind the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, then Leader of Democratic Left, in rejecting proposals to rectify the situation for people who had commenced paying insurance contributions on 6 April 1988 and had reached pension age before ten years of contributions were paid. It is a mean attitude to adopt and the measures introduced by the Minister are to be welcomed. They have been widely welcomed by those who, prior to the introduction of this Bill, would not have been in receipt of any contributory pension.</P>
      <P>This is the second Social Welfare Bill introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Last year's Bill and this year's Bill are progressive and I welcome them. There are widespread improvements for carers. The introduction of the farm assist scheme will be of particular importance for low income farmers. The introduction of the <i>pro rata</i> pensions will be of great benefit. The improvements and the additional funding provided for social inclusion measures in the budget amount to £317 million additional expenditure in 1999. That is a sizeable sum of money by any standards. It is expenditure which is welcome and which will be put to good use across the community and across all age groups by the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he was anxious to improve the lot of the older citizen in this State and the plight of carers. I welcome the fact that people who care for children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will be eligible for the carer's allowance. The residency requirement is being relaxed. All of us knew of cases where a son or daughter lived next door to an elderly parent and, while they cared for that parent on a night and day basis, they were denied the carer's allowance on the basis that they did not live under that same roof. I am glad the Minister and the Department are making provision whereby this residency requirement can be relaxed. I hope that in the regulations which will be brought forward, the residency requirements and the distance between households will not be too stringent. It would spoil the purpose of this amendment if they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the free telephone allowance scheme to all people in receipt of the carer's <Col N="100" /> allowance, and the extension of the free travel scheme to carers of people receiving constant attendance allowance and prescribed relative's allowance is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The proof of the improvements in the carer's allowance is reflected in the fact that the expenditure incurred will amount to a 40 per cent increase on previous expenditure. An additional £18 million is being spent on this scheme in 1999. That funding is being provided for one of the best schemes ever introduced by the Department.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that smaller-scale farmers have had serious problems with low income over the past six months. The new farm assist scheme will be of major help, regardless of what it is called &ndash; family income support or farm assist. The bottom line is that low income farmers and their families who need support must get it. This scheme, which was devised by the Minister, his Department and the Department of Finance, is one which will benefit rural areas. The smallholder's payment is paid to 6,600 people at present. The new farm assist scheme will enable a further 6,800 low income farmers to avail of assistance. I see no logic in Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks that this scheme will be of no assistance. If a scheme which incurs expenditure of £45 million in one year is of no benefit to any sector of society, I do not know where we are going. The small scale farmers whom I represent welcome this scheme. It will provide a necessary and valuable income support for those people and their families. I reject Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks about this scheme.</P>
    <P>It is important that in the regulations drawn up by the Minister, the farmer's net income from self-employment will be assessed at a rate of 80 per cent, not on a pound per pound basis, as currently applies under the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme. In addition, in the case of a farm family, an amount of £100 per annum for each of the first two children and £200 for each subsequent child will be disregarded when assessing the net income from the farm. Under the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme, when a farmer earned an extra pound, his unemployment assistance was reduced by a similar amount. That did not give anyone an incentive to improve their income, it was too restrictive. The Department's officials must process all applications as rapidly as possible. The signing on arrangements which exist for the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme are being suspended, another welcome measure.</P>
    <P>All of us have heard many cases of people who paid contributions for a number of years but who had not paid ten years of contributions when they reached pension age. I have seen cases where people have been short the necessary contributions by one day. I hope that a method can be found to ensure that people in that position &ndash; there would probably be very few in the country &ndash; would receive more than 50 per cent of the contributory pension. I hope some special provision will be made for those who have paid ten <Col N="101" /> years' contributions, for all intents and purposes. I ask the Minister and his officials to review this matter.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs now has a widespread programme of helping community development, which I welcome. The Minister stated that the work of the Department is now designed to help individuals and groups express their potential and make their contributions. I compliment the Minister and his officials in the regional office in Dundalk on their support for the very worthwhile Tullymongan Resource Centre in Cavan town. The Minister has been extremely helpful with this project and provided grant assistance for it. Assistance is also being provided for a development worker over the next three years under the Department's community development programme. That will ensure that this very worthwhile facility will be available to a large community which had no proper sporting, recreational or resource facilities in the past. It will now have a proper facility which has a playschool, crèche, kitchen, hall, games room, meeting and consultation rooms and an office. It will be an excellent facility in a large area of housing and has been driven by a very hard working group in the community. Were it not for the encouragement of the Department and some other State agencies it would not have been possible to put that facility in place. In one housing area there is a new facility that cost £256,000, and it is particularly important that the Department funds a community development worker for the next three years to ensure that maximum use is made of the facility.</P>
    <P>The Department has also given grants to many voluntary organisations, particularly in remote areas. It can be very difficult for small communities to provide worthwhile facilities in their own immediate area, and grant assistance of between £10,000 and £20,000 can make an enormous difference to a small community. It gives extra encouragement to those who are making a voluntary effort with the initiative.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe on the matter of savings. When one applies for a non-contributory pension it is absolutely ludicrous that there is a notional figure of the income that can be derived from savings. When the return on savings is extremely small it is time to adjust those figures considerably, and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that adequate contributory pension scheme regulations are put in place so that those who have put some savings by are not deprived of their right to enjoy a full, non-contributory pension. Those people have by and large worked hard all their lives and should not be denied the full pension payment rate when they reach pension age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill, which delivers on many of the commitments made in Partnership 2000 and in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The Minister's track record is second to none. This Bill puts to shame the performance of the previous Government in the social welfare area. However, I must give credit where <Col N="102" /> credit is due. A change of Government has worked major wonders on those in Fine Gael who have very lately rediscovered their social consciences. Deputy Bruton in particular has discovered his since he left office. He has suddenly decided that the children of this State are deserving of more support. Deputy O'Keeffe said the Opposition is to vote down millions of pounds worth of increases for different categories of recipients. What will the public say tomorrow when it discovers that Fine Gael is going to vote against increases in pensions, etc.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to those members of the Opposition who will be upset by the fact that in Government, Fianna Fáil will do what it always does: it will continue to deliver on the promises the party makes during election time. We have kept our promises to bring all social welfare payments up to the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, and most payments are now over the recommended levels. Nobody can contradict me when I say that this is the most sweeping and comprehensive package of social welfare increases and improvements that has ever been presented by any Government. It is estimated that those increases will cost over £300 million extra in a full year.</P>
      <P>Some of the areas covered by this Bill include the additional benefits that will apply to many social welfare recipients including those on old age pension, invalidity pension, disability allowance, retirement pension, unemployment assistance, family income supplement and supplementary welfare allowance. There are enhanced packages for carers, FIS recipients, child benefit, employment support, back to education support and voluntary and community services.</P>
      <P>A contributory old age pensioner will be in receipt of £89 per week as of June 1999. We gave a commitment that we would bring that pension up to £100 per week on a phased basis, and we are well ahead of target in keeping our promise that all those pensioners will be paid that figure by the year 2002. Since we took office there will have been a 14 per cent increase in total in the level of pensions. This increase is well ahead of the social welfare increases delivered by the previous Government. However, to be fair to them, they only make pre-election promises; they do not have to deliver on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Provision is made for a new pro rata pension for the self-employed at a cost of £18 million in a full year, and up to 10,000 people will benefit. Self-<Col N="103" /> employed pensioners who narrowly lost out on qualifying for a pension will be pleased with this Bill. Occupational pension funds are doing well out of the record pension increases we currently enjoy. The Minister has decided to provide greater flexibility for pension planning for the self-employed. It is important that protective measures be built in to protect the self-employed pensioner against unwise or incorrect investment by fund managers. We must ensure that there are mechanisms in place to guarantee that there are ample funds in place to cover pensioners when they reach retirement age.</P>
    <P>There has been a comprehensive reform of the carer's allowance under this Bill that will enable an extra 3,000 carers to qualify for this benefit. Carers groups and individual carers have looked for certain improvements. They have asked for credits for carers and that the free travel pass be extended to other carer categories. They have asked that carers of children with special needs should qualify and they have requested the relaxation of full time care and attention rules. They have asked that the stipulation that one must live with the person one cares for be amended and they have rightly requested a respite care payment. I can think of no group that deserves it more.</P>
    <P>All these points are addressed in this Bill, which also provides a new farm assist scheme in addition to the fodder scheme and other measures introduced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Farmers are treated with respect and dignity and there is extra support for farm families with children. Incentives are provided to increase income from farming and other sources. Fianna Fáil has always represented the small farmer and in the present difficult time it has moved to help them. Our record in this regard speaks for itself. Big farmers are lucky in that they are not affected as badly as the small farmer by the current farm crisis. Fishermen will benefit from the fishing assist scheme, and there will be a new method of assessment of income for fishermen claiming unemployment assistance. Qualifying conditions have also been eased.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to increase the bereavement allowance has been honoured, and it now stands at £500. The Minister stated that this increase is intended to be used to defray the cost of funeral expenses at the very difficult time of the loss of a loved one. I fully support his view that it must not lead to increased funeral costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides an extra £41 million for child benefit. It contains provisions for improvements in the family income supplement scheme to ensure families are better off at work.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The purpose of this Bill is to provide a rational and relatively straightforward solution for an obvious folly that has become part and parcel of our court sentencing policy and our prison regime, that is the jailing of persons for the non-payment of fines and civil debts. An average of 10,000 offenders pass through the prison system each year. Some 2,100 or one in every five who pass through the gates of our prisons are so incarcerated because they have been unable or unwilling to pay the fines imposed on them. The nonsense of this is underlined by the fact that the offence in each case was not seen by the court as a custodial offence that merited prison. The judge deemed in each case that the appropriate penalty was a financial one, that the offence did not merit a prison sentence and that a prison sentence would only come into play in the event of the fine, imposed by the court, not being paid within a specified period.</P>
      <P>It is patently obvious that to continue to jail 2,000 persons each year for minor and non-custodial offences or for the non-payment of civil debts achieves nothing but is costly and counterproductive. It puts huge pressure and strain on an already overcrowded prison system. One could hardly find a lengthier or more impressive list of negatives than those which attend the jailing of fine defaulters or civil debtors. The defaulter or the debtor is notified by the Garda that he or she is to be collected on a particular day at a particular time. If the Garda patrol car is used it involves a Garda driver and two other gardaí to escort the prisoner to Mountjoy Jail. If private taxi or hackney transport is used two gardaí travel in the hired car from the prisoner's home to the place of detention. It costs between £200 and £300 for a taxi or a hackney car from a rural area depending on the length of the journey, the waiting time and the return journey. There is the additional cost of Garda overtime and meals. There is also the additional factor of the absence of two or three gardaí from their station for the best part of that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For each day the defaulter or civil debtor is detained in prison the taxpayer has to foot the Bill to the tune of £126 per day. Generally after a short period the person is moved to another place of detention involving further transport and personnel costs. The farce is further compounded when the individual is generally released having served only a fraction of the sentence because of <Col N="105" /> the pressure on prison space. The revolving door simply keeps revolving. The end result is that it has cost the State a huge sum of money to jail a person for a relatively non-jailable offence. The person is released after a short period and the fine goes unpaid.</P>
    <P>The operation and the continuation of such a ludicrous scheme is an abuse of an already overstretched prison system. It is also a gross abuse of the taxpayer who has to fork out a conservative £2.5 million when there are obvious and sensible alternative solutions available. I am not claiming to be the originator of the idea of keeping fined defaulters and debtors out of jail by dealing with them through a range of other sanctions and alternatives. The report of the committee of inquiry into the prison system, established by the Government in 1994 and chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker, recommended: &ldquo;The committee considers that there should be a reliable statutory basis for confiscation of property or assets to enforce fines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In June 1994 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform published a five year plan entitled The Management of Offenders, the first chapter of which states:</P>
    <P>There is, indeed, the view that alternatives to custody should be the only permissible form of sanction in the case of certain categories of offenders, such as fine defaulters or debtors. The imprisonment of such people is said to be wrong in principle. It is also seen as representing a completely unjustifiable waste of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>The crime forum report, published in December 1998, speaks in similar tones. Unfortunately because it was published just before Christmas it did not receive the degree of attention, analysis or credit which it richly deserves. It is scathingly critical of the manner in which penal policy is operated here. One of the areas on which it focused was committals for the non-payment of fines. It states: &ldquo;it seems a curious strategy in circumstances in which prisons are so overcrowded&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have three expert reports commissioned by the Ministers for Justice of the day, all bearing the official stamp of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all exhorting a change of policy as regards the jailing of fine defaulters and civil debtors.</P>
    <P>I published this Bill on 26 May 1998. I deliberately held back bringing the Bill before the House in Private Members' time to see what action might be forthcoming from the Government side. The Minister will acknowledge I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business to indicate where exactly the Government stood in relation to fine defaulters and civil debtors. Invariably the Taoiseach's response has been that the Government's Attachment of Earnings Bill was at an early stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>The Government published its most recent legislative programme on 26 January. Not alone <Col N="106" /> is the Government's promised Attachment of Earnings Bill not among the list of 16 Bills to be published this term, it is not even on the subsequent list of 24 Bills in respect of which texts are being prepared and which, according to the programme, &ldquo;will be published as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The promised Government Bill is among a list of 61 Bills &ldquo;in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by Government&rdquo;. The list acknowledges that work is &ldquo;at a preliminary stage in the Department&rdquo;. In other words, it is unlikely that the proposed Bill will see the light of day even if the Government were to run to its full term.</P>
    <P>While the Minister will make the point that even though 2,100 fine defaulters and civil debtors pass through the prison system each year, they constitute only between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent of the prison population at any one time. That may well be true because of the farcical revolving door system and prison overcrowding but even at 1 per cent or 1.5 per cent it means that on any one day 40 valuable prison spaces, which should be reserved for people of proven criminal intent and who pose threats to society, are being wasted on people who are essentially non-criminal.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces attachment of earnings orders for those in employment, attachment of welfare orders for those on social welfare, a structured means inquiry so that the repayment of the fines or civil debts are levied in accordance with the defaulters' or the debtors' means and ability to pay. The court also has the option to extend community service orders where appropriate. The court is empowered to extend the time for payment of fines. There is also a provision to allow fines to be paid in instalments. A scheme of money payment service orders is introduced where advice and assistance on repayment of fines and civil debts are provided by the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>Section 4 empowers the court to order that periodic deductions are made from the earnings of the debtor or defaulter.</P>
    <P>The court must have regard to normal deduction rates and the protected earnings rate. The attachment order will specify the amount to be paid, a period over which such deductions are to be made and any costs which may have been incurred by a failure to meet the original fine or debt payment. The introduction of the protected earnings rate means that due regard must be had to the ability to pay so that the burden of the repayments will not lead to further defaulting.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets down procedures for the notification to employers of an attachment of earnings order by the court clerk or registrar. It requires an employer to comply with an attachment order in respect of a civil debtor or fine defaulter in his employment. If the debtor or defaulter is either not in the employer's employment or has ceased to be his employee, the employer must, within ten days of receiving the order, notify the court to that effect. Where deductions are made on foot <Col N="107" /> of attachment orders, the employer shall give the defaulter or debtor a written statement of the total amount paid. The debtor or defaulter is obliged by section 6 to provide to the court full details of his employer, his earnings, and his expected earnings, and this must be duly certified by the employer.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with a change of employment on the part of the defaulter or debtor. When this takes place the debtor or defaulter must notify the court within ten days of any such change and provide details of his earnings and expected earnings in his new employment. Likewise, the employer must confirm in writing to the court that he is the debtor's or defaulter's employer and confirm the employee's earnings and expected earnings.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 the court may hear an application from either the employer or the debtor-defaulter as to whether a source of income is income for the purposes of this Bill. Section 9 deals with persons who have defaulted and who are employed in the public service. It designates the chief officer or secretary general of the Department or body as the person who has the defaulter-debtor in his employment. In the event of a doubt or dispute as to which Department, public body, organisation, authority or service is the appropriate employer of the debtor or defaulter, the matter, having been referred to him by the court shall be determined by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 10, the court may make an order to vary or discharge an attachment of earnings order. Section 13 sets down the penalties for non-compliance with such orders or for knowingly providing false or misleading information in respect of employment or earnings. I must apologise to the House for the printer's error in section 13(2) of the Bill. The text should read as follows:</P>
    <P>Where a person gives a court&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)a statement pursuant to <i>section 6</i>, or</P>
    <P>(b)a notification under <i>section 7</i>,</P>
    <P>that is to his knowledge false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200, or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to make deductions at source for debt or fine defaulters who are in receipt of social welfare payments and to transfer such deducted payments to the court. Central to this provision is the court inquiry as to the defaulter's means in order to ensure the deductions do not impose impossible burdens. This scheme parallels the procedures set down in earlier sections which apply to those in receipt of income from employment. In this section, <Col N="108" /> however, provision is made for appeal and review.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, is amended and extended in the Bill to enable community service orders to be imposed as an alternative to attachment of earnings orders. Again, this is a useful and positive option to be available to a court.</P>
    <P>Often a person who owes a fine is unable to meet the payment within the original time limits set down by the court. At present these people end up in jail, albeit for a day or a month. Section 16 introduces a sensible adjustment to existing practice whereby the fine defaulter can go back to the court to apply for an extension of time within which to pay. Having adjudicated on the merits of the case, the court makes its determination on the basis of the arguments advanced in support of such an extension.</P>
    <P>When a fine is imposed by a court, its impact varies enormously according to the means of the person levied and his or her ability to pay. While a £100 or £200 fine would be of little consequence to people of considerable means and resources it could well impose impossible hardship on a person of modest means with a heavy mortgage, a large family and no access to borrowing. At present the hands of the law are tied &ndash; the gardaí cannot accept part-payment and invariably the person ends up in jail with all the attendant expense. Section 17 provides for instalment payment of fines. This is a logical measure designed to ensure the fines are paid in full while eliminating the over-punitive prison sanction and the waste of resources in the needless jailing of such people.</P>
    <P>To assist fine defaulters in paying fines within the time set down by the court, section 18 enlists the assistance of the Probation and Welfare Service. The introduction of money payment supervision orders enables defaulters to plan and make repayments in a streamlined and structured way under the guidance and assistance of a probation and welfare officer. In the event of default, the officer in question makes a written or oral report to the court and it is a matter for the court to decide what further action to take.</P>
    <P>The Bill is by no means the complete antidote to the many problems besetting our prison service. It is, however, a pragmatic, practical, and relatively straightforward way of dealing with a costly, negative and outdated practice which should have been tackled long ago. I therefore hope the Minister will see his way to accept the Bill on Second Stage and allow it to proceed to Committee Stage. If aspects of the Bill require improvement let us do so collectively in committee. Let us not long-finger once again the opportunity with which we are now presented. Each year this issue remains unaddressed the cost to the taxpayer is £2.5 million, at a conservative estimate, in terms of transport, prison accommodation, Garda overtime, lost Garda time, and fines forfeited by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> We need to look objectively at what the huge body of expert available evidence and opinion is telling us about our prison service. It is indefensible that we should continue to pour millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into a system which is a proven failure. There is no holistic thinking on or clear philosophy of what our prison system is supposed to achieve. Without clear visions, aims, and objectives there is no yardstick to judge how our prisons are achieving or performing. When will we stand back and ask ourselves the honest questions about the prison service? When will we set down performance criteria?</P>
    <P>In the wake of so many commentaries on the performance of the prison service, it is incredible that we have failed to tackle the fundamental failings of the system.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Whitaker report was an official Department report, as was Management of Offenders &ndash; a Five Year Plan, issued in 1994, the discussion paper, Tackling Crime, issued in 1997, and the National Crime Forum report of 1998, commissioned by the present Minister. Essentially, all these documents which were commissioned by the Department agree on the need for major reform. However, none of them contains a more damning denunciation than the National Crime Forum report commissioned by the Minister. Paragraph after paragraph of the two chapters dealing with sanctions against offenders and the prison system spell out, in clear detail, how unsatisfactory is the prison system. It states:</P>
    <P>Prison appears unsuited to the task of rehabilitating offenders and preventing them from reoffending. Indeed for many it can be the school which educates inmates to graduate to more serious crime.</P>
    <P>That is not my assertion, it is a quotation from the National Crime Forum report. The report further states &ldquo;A study carried out in Mountjoy in 1997 indicates that recidivism rates among Irish prisoners are extraordinarily high &ndash; a typical prisoner had 15 previous convictions, five non-custodial and ten custodial sentences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The textbook referred to was that of a report carried out by a former employee of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the criminologist Paul O'Mahony, in which he sets down in graphic detail the results of a survey of 160 prisoners, namely, that there was a 70 per cent reoffending rate, an average conviction rate of 15, and 77 per cent of those surveyed had started in St. Patrick's Institution. So much for prison being a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The National Crime Forum report states that &ldquo;Remand prisoners who have not been found guilty in many cases spend more time in prison than convicted criminals. It also states that &ldquo;There is a much greater use of imprisonment in the Irish criminal justice system than in many comparable countries&rdquo;, and we are second from the top in that regard. The report refers to the <Col N="110" /> Netherlands, England, Wales, France, Australia and Canada as &ldquo;comparable countries&rdquo;. Again these are not my assertions, they are direct quotations from the National Crime Forum report published in December 1998.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state that &ldquo;Irish courts are far more likely to use custody as a sanction than those elsewhere..We send far more young people to prison than other administrations. Some one third of our prisoners in Ireland are under 21 years of age, despite the universal avowal that prison should be a last resort in dealing with young offenders.&rdquo;  It is a terrible indictment that one third of prisoners are under 21 years of age. What hope have they of embarking on any kind of civilised existence?</P>
    <P>The National Crime Forum report indicates:</P>
    <P>There is an absence of coherent thinking about the problem. We do not appear to have a clear philosophy on the relative use of different forms of sanction..The number one issue facing the criminal justice system was the extent to which large numbers of those who at present receive custodial sentences could be dealt with by means of supervised community sanctions..Custodial sanctions are too readily available and are seen as the normal response to law breaking..76 per cent of prisoners &ndash; the 1991 figure &ndash; were committed for non-violent offences..The statistics for 1994 &ndash; published in May 1998 [this is a fundamental problem and means that we are four years in arrears in respect of vital statistics which should be a key component in addressing essential areas of criminal justice policy] show that the overwhelming majority of those committed to prison on conviction have been committed either for non-violent offences against property or more frequently for less serious offences.. Open prisons were acknowledged by most contributors to be a promising aspect of the system, but they are underused.&rdquo;  The figures confirm the latter point, Loughan House and other open centres are not occupied by anything like their full complement while Mountjoy Prison is bursting at the seams.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Prison officers have little opportunity to become involved in treatment, rehabilitation, counselling and other elements of what might constitute part of a plan for the management of prisoners..A planned programme could not at present be said to exist..Hostel accommodation or halfway house arrangements will be needed in certain cases. Such accommodation exists thanks to the good work of PACE but not in sufficient quantity..Ex-prisoners find themselves homeless or without money or under pressure to return to drug abuse..The situation in Mountjoy is very disquieting. It is <Col N="111" /> clear that a number of prisoners in Mountjoy should be in a mental hospital..Of some 3,000 with a drug addiction problem who pass through prison each year, only 70 receive treatment and only nine are in any kind of structured treatment programme of the day.</P>
    <P>I again stress that these are not my words, they originate from the National Crime Forum report which further states:</P>
    <P>We heard accounts of some prisoners being released without any preparation for their re-entry into society because the probation and welfare service had not been informed of their impending release..many prisoners are released without any input from the probation and welfare service..The report of the prison chaplains for 1997-8 states that rape and sexual assaults are a reality in Irish prisons is almost certainly under-reported..Alternatives to imprisonment such as community service cost only a fraction of the cost of keeping someone in prison..The demand to build 2,000 places over the lifetime of the present Government bringing the total to 4,000 was frequently referred to. It was pointed out probably correctly that if we build those places we will almost certainly fill them. In other words to provide extra prison places would probably militate against any intention to substitute other sanctions for imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed in this direct extract from the forum report.</P>
    <P>The report and its predecessors point in the same direction, namely, that Irish penal policy is a failure, that there is a need to embark on major prison reform and that there is a need to refocus and to adopt policies that work rather than slavishly following the models of the past which neither deter nor rehabilitate, and which do not work.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten thousand inmates go through the prison system each year. That system has an annual operational cost of £100 million, the number of prison staff is more than 2,000 and the annual cost of keeping one prisoner in jail is £46,000. As the Minister knows, keeping people behind bars is an expensive business. Not only is it expensive, in many cases prison, regardless of the cost, is not the most appropriate solution when trying to deal with people who have broken the law. Perhaps we should consider what we are trying to achieve when we send someone to prison. Is it purely to punish them or are we trying to achieve some form of rehabilitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 70 per cent of those released from prison reoffend. Surely this is a clear indication that in most cases imprisonment as a method of reform <Col N="112" /> and rehabilitation is a costly and counterproductive failure. Of course prison spaces are necessary. Justice must be done after a crime has been committed. Many offenders may be a danger to society and need to be behind bars. However, there is nothing soft or wrong in seeking alternatives to the prison system. There is much to be gained.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most obvious example of people who do not need to be behind bars are those who are imprisoned because they are unwilling or unable to pay fines that are due. At present, one in five people behind bars are in this situation. Are these people a danger to society? Do they need to be taken out of circulation? I do not think so. Prison should be the last resort rather than the first and only resort open to a judge and jury. It is ridiculous to suggest that the taxpayer should foot the bill for keeping these people in prison, particularly when the system is under such pressure. Not only that, the fines are never paid. If anything, the taxpayer is being fined. Instead of imprisonment, we should seek other alternatives.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow the courts to deal in a different way with people who cannot or will not pay fines. The offender will still be punished but it will not cost the State a fortune as at present. Allowing these offenders to pay what they owe over time and under supervision makes sense. Deputy Higgins explained how the system would work. The Bill would free up valuable prison spaces for those who should be behind bars and allow the system to operate more efficiently. Providing more prison spaces is not the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Higgins, on introducing the Bill which the Government should accept. I have petitioned the Minister about many sad cases in County Mayo. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that those who owe money to the State or individuals do not end up in prison.</P>
      <P>I compliment prison governors and their staff on being compassionate and understanding. We are lucky to have individuals of such quality working in the service. I have always found the governors with whom I have been in contact helpful in dealing with cases, some serious, others minor.</P>
      <P>At times &ndash; this is not a criticism &ndash; judges are not on the ground in handing down fines. A constituent of mine in north Mayo was fined £500 for drink driving. The judge should have sent him to prison for three to six months as he continued to drink and his wife had to pay the fine. It was she who suffered. A £500 fine to someone on social welfare is akin to a £50,000 fine to a millionaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Owen, did an excellent job and introduced excellent legislation under which the Garda Síochána was given extra powers and resources to deal with the drug barons in our cities, particularly Dublin. It should <Col N="113" /> now turn its attention to drug barons in rural Ireland. It is the drug barons and thugs who should be behind bars, not those who owe £500 to the State or individuals. I agree with Deputy Higgins that it should be possible to pay off small fines weekly by way of an attachment order against social welfare payments or property.</P>
    <P>It is not popular to say this but there was nothing wrong with the petition system which should be reintroduced on Committee Stage. There are genuine hardship cases. It was wrong for the media to criticise the Minister whenever he reduced a fine. It is also wrong that fines are collected on behalf of the State by the Garda Síochána which has far more important work to do. The money used to pay fines is required by those on social welfare to feed and buy clothes for their children. I raised the matter with the Minister's predecessor and got into trouble with the media. A constituent of mine even won a prize from the Law Society. We should ignore the begrudgers. Barristers are on £1,400 to £1,500 per day. Those on social welfare are on £140 to £150 per week. There is another section of society which I will not name &ndash; a colleague of mine is in court next week &ndash; which is clogging the system. They should be dealt with. One should not be sent to jail for the non-payment of a fine.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to accept the Bill. If it has shortcomings, they can be rectified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Prison governors and their staff have been subject to much criticism during the years. They do a good job. I compliment them on being lenient and helpful to those who have not been committed for serious crimes and to their families. It is up to the Government to resolve the overtime problem by providing the necessary staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The untimely death of our colleague, the late Deputy Upton, casts a long shadow over this debate. Up to a couple of weeks ago he was his party's spokesperson on Justice, which meant that Deputy Jim Higgins and I spent a considerable amount of time over the past 18 months with him in this Chamber debating Justice issues. Eloquent tributes were paid to him by party leaders yesterday. It is, therefore, appropriate for me to take this opportunity to express my personal condolences to his family. In many ways he led an exemplary life. He was full of commitment, dedication, generosity and magnanimity. He brought credit to the House in almost everything he did as a Member and he distinguished it by his presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was also a man of considerable good humour. On one occasion he told the House the holy hour was introduced in Dublin to try to get civil servants back to work after lunch. One of my more senior civil servants who, by tradition, shall be nameless, wrote me a note which I sent to Deputy Upton. It read: &ldquo;It is not the first time <Col N="114" /> that politicians have tried to blame civil servants&rdquo;.  He greatly enjoyed that. He was a decent and honourable man and the House is a lesser place for his passing.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Jim Higgins for preparing the Enforcement Of Court Orders Bill, 1998. Having produced many Private Members' Bills in my time as Opposition spokesman on Justice, I am well aware of the considerable amount of work which goes into them. While I disagree with much of the Deputy's analysis of the operation of the criminal justice system, I recognise that he has done the House a service by providing us with an opportunity to discuss some important issues which arise in relation to our law and practice in cases of non-payment of fines and debts.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues raised by the Bill are ones that need to be addressed but, for reasons which I will explain, the Government does not accept that the approach which the Bill takes to these matters is prudent, sensible or practicable. We are concerned that what the Bill proposes could undermine the existing system for the payment of fines, could prove proportionately expensive to administer, could place impossible administrative burdens on both the courts and the gardaí and, despite claims made to the contrary, would make no significant improvement with regard to existing pressure on prison accommodation. In these circumstances, the Government must oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, in doing so, I assure the House that we are addressing the type of issues dealt with by the Bill with a view to devising practicable proposals, especially in relation to attachment of earnings. We are doing so in the context of the establishment of the new courts service and against a background of an unprecedented investment of £11 million in information technology systems for the courts.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the unprecedented scale of the prison building programme which the Government has undertaken. I believe it to be fundamentally misplaced. If there has been one factor more than any other over the past decade or more which has most hampered the effective operation of our criminal justice system, it has been the operation of the revolving door in our prison system. It has meant that people who are apprehended by the gardaí and convicted and sentenced by the courts have been released early, not because it has been judged to be in the best interests of society, but because there has not been sufficient space to hold them. It is that lack of space which has prevented us so far from giving full effect to the provisions of the Bail Act, 1997, which emanated from a decision by the people in a referendum, although I am glad to be able to tell the House that because of the prison building programme, I expect to be able to do so later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> There appears to be an assumption in some quarters that to favour more prison building automatically implies a lack of support for alternatives to custody, or, indeed,<i> vice versa.</i> That, of course, is a far cry from reality. An effective criminal justice system needs an appropriate balance between custodial and non-custodial alternatives. In this context it must be recognised that unless imprisonment is available as the ultimate sanction, this can undermine the effective operation of non-custodial alternatives. For example, if there is insufficient prison space available to ensure that a person in breach of a community service order will serve the custodial sentence which arises in those circumstances, it has implications for the successful operation of the community service scheme.</P>
    <P>The prison building programme which the Government is undertaking should enable us to do two things: first, we should be able for once and for all to stop the prison door revolving and, second, it should enable us to ensure that the standard of custodial accommodation which we provide for all prisoners is appropriate. This is very important because I have consistently stated that one of my principal aims as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to end the entire revolving door syndrome once and for all.</P>
    <P>While I accept that alternatives to custody have an important and, I hope, increasing role to play in our criminal justice system, we are fooling ourselves by pretending we can ensure the efficient operation of the criminal justice system without making the sort of investment we are making in the building programme. This Bill is a good case in point. It is presented as a significant measure in terms of easing existing pressure on prison accommodation. However, leaving aside my other reservations about the Bill, it will do nothing of the sort. Statistics on the number of people in custody for non-payment of fines and debts tend to be used in a way which distorts reality when the implications for prison accommodation are being considered. Committals in relation to non-payment of fines and debts in 1996 amounted to approximately 18 per cent of all committals to custody, but at any given time the number of prison places being occupied by people in this category amounts generally to between 1 and 1.5 per cent of the prison population.</P>
    <P>The explanation for this is straightforward, the time spent by debt or fine defaulters in custody is generally short. This arises because, generally, the sentences in these cases are relatively short. In addition, some defaulters make payment either on committal or shortly afterwards. Even if this Bill had the effect that no fine or debt defaulter took up prison places in future &ndash; it would be most unlikely to have that effect &ndash; the result would be the availability of perhaps an extra 30 extra prison places, an average of less than three <Col N="116" /> places in each of our custodial institutions. That is also misleading in the sense that many defaulters are held in open prisons and there is no guarantee that there would be other prisoners in closed institutions suitable for transfer to open centres to take up these places should they become available.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that although fine and debt defaulters represent only a tiny fraction of our prison population at any given time, the number of committals place a heavy administrative burden on our committal prisons. Nevertheless, to simply displace that burden to the court service and the gardaí, as the Bill appears to do, would not be the solution. While I accept the general proposition that imprisonment should be a sanction of last resort and that we need to address the issues raised by this Bill, it will be clear that to put this measure forward as having substantial positive implications in terms of prison accommodation is unsustainable.</P>
    <P>I will return shortly to substantial problems with the detail of what the Bill proposes but in the context I have outlined it might be helpful to inform the House in some detail of what in practice we are doing to ensure that our prison accommodation is adequate. By the end of this year over 1,200 extra prison places will have been provided by this Government. The planning and consultation process is under way regarding the other 800 places promised during the lifetime of the Government. Fine Gael opposes much of this prison building programme. It was unforgivable, but might be understandable, that in Government the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, postponed or cancelled the prison at Castlerea, but it is incomprehensible that the Opposition now opposes the building of much needed prison spaces &ndash; maybe it wants to make this Government the first in the history of the State to bring down the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The replacement D Block at Limerick Prison was opened by me in December 1997 and is fully operational. The new prison at Castlerea was completed and opened by me in May 1998. The prison was brought into use immediately and now houses more than 150 prisoners.</P>
    <P>The construction work at the new remand prison at Cloverhill with 400 places and the new female prison at Mountjoy with 80 places is almost complete and will be handed over by the builders in the first quarter of this year. Following fit out and detailed security systems being put in place, they will become operational during 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, following Government approval and an EU wide tender competition, I signed the contract for the new Midlands Prison with 400 places in May 1998. The construction work on this project is well under way and is due to be completed in August 1999. It is said to be the fastest building project of its size. The Government also approved an extension to the Midlands Pri<Col N="117" /> son of a further 115 places and it is expected that building work will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Alongside the prisons building programme, there is a comprehensive programme of works being carried out in the existing prisons, particularly in Portlaoise and Limerick. The main priority is the improvement of prisoner, staff and administration facilities and the extension of in-cell sanitation to all closed prisons. I have overseen the commencement of a comprehensive and wide-ranging consultation process in relation to the refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison, which included consultations with prison governors, prison staff, the medical director and other medical staff and the co-ordinators of work training and education. This process will be completed in early 1999 with a view to completing a building brief and tender process by mid 1999.</P>
    <P>This programme evidences the Government's determination that our criminal justice system should have available to it the resources necessary to meet the demands placed on it. I emphasise that this approach is fully consistent with developing appropriate alternatives to custody to the greatest extent possible. As I mentioned earlier, it is not a question of doing one or the other. In this context, I remind the House that I established an expert group on the probation and welfare service. It has already issued one report and I look forward to receiving its final report in early May.</P>
    <P>The Bill would place further burdens on the operation of the probation and welfare service in at least two ways. The first arises under section 15 which would allow community service rather than imprisonment to be imposed in the case of fine or debt default. While I do not have a closed mind on the subject, this issue is far from straightforward. In particular, I understand that when the Community Service Act was introduced it was decided as a matter of policy, so it would be treated as a genuine alternative to custody, that it could only be imposed where otherwise a custodial sentence, rather than a fine or any other non-custodial sanction, would have been imposed.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in using community service in the cases of debt as distinct from non-payment of fines. That arises because the primary purpose of imprisonment in debt cases is to attempt to ensure that the money owed is paid over to the creditor and there must be some doubt that the use of community service is appropriate in that context. It may be useful to mention in this context that where a person is committed to prison because of failure to pay a debt, that person is committed for failure, through wilful default or culpable neglect, to obey an order of the court. The court would have to go through an extensive procedure before making an instalment order and finally a committal order sending the <Col N="118" /> person to prison. This is a mechanism for enforcing the court's instalment order.</P>
    <P>The second burden the Bill would place on the probation and welfare service arises under section 18 where a person given time to pay a fine can be placed under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer for the purpose of assisting and advising that person in regard to payment of the fine. I wonder if this would represent making the greatest use of the resources of the probation and welfare service. Not least there is the cost factor involved, particularly where the amount of the fine may be small.</P>
    <P>I am aware that section 18 mirrors a provision in UK legislation but I am also aware that Home Office research indicates it is rarely used. It would be wrong to argue that what we are putting in the balance is invariably the cost of using a probation and welfare officer's time in this way compared to the cost of imprisoning a person for non-payment. If the Bill was enacted, there is no guarantee that it would be confined in practice to people who would otherwise have been imprisoned if this provision did not exist.</P>
    <P>This, in many ways, is the central difficulty with many of the Bill's provisions. Fines amounting to approximately £8 million are paid each year. People pay fines at present on the understanding that failure to do so would lead to imprisonment. However, with the provisions in the Bill in relation to defaulters, not least Part II dealing with attachment of earnings, it may be the case that people who are prepared to pay fines under present arrangements would be happy to take their chances instead with the alternatives in relation to non-payment which the Bill provides. Were this to happen, the current fine system could be grievously undermined.</P>
    <P>These alternatives would involve further court hearings and a substantial amount of administrative work for both court staff and the gardaí which could prove costly and divert people from more important work. Under the Bill, where someone fails to pay a fine of £50, there could be a further court hearing in relation to making an attachment order and further administrative work in making the necessary arrangements for enforcing the attachment order. The costs involved could be enormous in relation to the amount of the fine involved. It would not be right to compare those costs with the alternative cost of imprisonment because in light of the terms of the Bill, many people might default in payment who otherwise would not have done so. There is no controlling mechanism in the Bill as to when the provisions come into play other than that someone has been in default of payment of a fine or debt.</P>
    <P>The Government legislative programme contains a commitment in relation to an attachment of earnings Bill. To this end, a considerable amount of work has been carried out in my Department, including research in relation to <Col N="119" /> committals for non-payment of fines and debts and an examination of the law in some other jurisdictions. Because of the complexity of the issues involved, work is not yet at the stage where we are able to finalise proposals which would get around the type of difficulties which arise and which are evident from the Bill. Attachment of earnings will have a role to play if carefully focused where, for example, someone wilfully refuses to pay a fine he or she is well able to pay. However, we need to examine further how we could best achieve that in a way that does not undermine the operation of the fines system generally.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for attachment orders on amounts payable as income support. While I would not completely rule out this option, I am sure all Members of the House will recognise it is an issue which must be approached with great caution. In this context, it must be borne in mind that social welfare payments made to an individual often include elements in relation to dependants and it is hardly sustainable that that part of the payment should be subject to an attachment order.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the payment of fines by instalment. There is no provision for payment of fines by instalment at present and the courts administration is not geared to provide such a service. I understand that traditionally the view was taken that the administrative costs of providing for payment by instalment would be prohibitively high. However, I accept that there must be some doubt that an attachment of earnings scheme would be appropriate in the absence of a scheme whereby fines could be paid by instalment.</P>
    <P>Non-payment of debt gives rise to different considerations because of the existence already of instalment orders in such cases, although an option to attach earnings where there is a failure to comply with instalment orders is an issue which is being addressed in the examination under way in my Department at present. I will return to the question of payment of fines by instalment later.</P>
    <P>While the Government is not in a position to support the Bill for the reasons I have outlined, I assure the House that the matter will not rest there. All the evidence shows that the Government is determined to have as efficient a court system as possible and it is against that background that the issues to which the Bill gives rise are being addressed. In that context, I want to mention two developments.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that last year we enacted the Courts Service Act. There had been a recognition for some time that, no matter how well we had been served by our courts in the past, the administrative infrastructure was in need of extensive restructuring so that it would be well placed to cope with the ever changing demands being made upon it which in turn reflected <Col N="120" /> changes in society generally. During the passage of this legislation there was widespread agreement in the House that the establishment of the courts service would lead to the changes that are necessary to bring about a forward looking courts service which will be as responsive as possible to the needs of its customers as we head into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that subsequently a Courts Service Transition Board was appointed which in turn appointed Mr. P.J. FitzPatrick, the former chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board, as the chief executive officer designate of the courts service. I am sure all Members of the House will join with me in wishing Mr. FitzPatrick well in his new appointment. Arrangements are being made to make the full transition to an independent court service as quickly as possible. I mention this development not just as evidence of the commitment of this Government to as efficient a court service as possible, but also to highlight that, in advancing our proposals on matters affecting court administration, we will consult fully with the new service.</P>
    <P>The second significant development worth mentioning in the context of this Bill is that towards the end of last year, together with the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, and Mrs. Justice Denham, I launched a major information systems development programme at a cost of £11 million over the next three years for the new courts service. There is a broad and specific context in which this development is relevant to the issues we are discussing this evening. The broad issue stems from the fact, which I believe has been recognised on all sides of the House for many years, that the process of decision making in the criminal justice system has been hampered by the lack of adequate information systems to underpin decision making. That deficit in relation to the courts will be fully addressed by this proposed development. The specific issue arises because one of the priority areas for examination in this project is the area of fines. I hope it will prove possible in that context to address in particular the issue of the payment of fines by instalment as proposed in the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to the House to elaborate somewhat on the information systems development programme for the courts which we are undertaking. The new systems will address many of the information gaps in courts on an operational and management level. The systems should make a major contribution to the success of the new courts service and will benefit all those who work in, or do business with, the courts. In support of these developments, a modern communications infrastructure in every court office in the State is being designed and built. Over the next year or so, each office will have a modern cabling infrastructure installed and <Col N="121" /> within the three year timescale all offices will be linked through the central data repository in the courts service headquarters in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on the Courts Commission, in its very first report, recognised the lack of innovation in the use of information technology in the Irish courts system. The courts are ideally placed to take advantage of the prevailing and emerging technologies. As part of the positive response to the working group's reports, planning and procurement began leading to the major development programme I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The consortium appointed to lead this programme will work with the courts service to provide a range of information system development skills together with project management, business process improvement and workflow management expertise across a total of 11 new applications which have been identified as essential for the courts service.</P>
    <P>Part of the development will be an examination of court administration processes and also of the links between the courts and other agencies in the criminal justice system. Priority areas for examination include processing of summonses, charge sheets, case outcomes, bail applications, warrants, prisoner movements and, as I mentioned earlier, fines. All involve co-ordination of systems developments across a number of agencies. Working groups have been making recommendations for improvements in each of these areas.</P>
    <P>The general point I want to make about these developments in the context of the Bill before the House is that I am confident the major development programme in the courts, which is mirrored by similar developments in relation to the gardaí and the prison service, should over time enable us to introduce innovative responses to particular issues which arise in the criminal justice system which hitherto were impracticable because the infrastructure did not exist to support them.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be clear from what I have said that, while we have grave doubts about the practicality of much of what is proposed in the Bill, we recognise that it gives rise to issues which need to be addressed. These issues are being addressed by the Government, particularly in the context of the establishment of the new courts service and against the background of the unprecedented investment in technology to underpin the operation of the courts. In devising its own proposals for legislation in this area the Government will have full regard to what is contained in Deputy Higgins's Bill, and the views of Deputies which emerge during the course of this evening's debate.</P>
    <P>There were a number of issues which Deputy Higgins, in the course of his address, neglected to mention. I introduced the legislation establishing the new courts service and I have appointed a <Col N="122" /> chairman of the new interim prisons authority. I have had 18 Bills enacted since my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and many more are before the House or will be ready shortly. There was one glaring omission from Deputy Higgins's contribution. He made no mention, and never does in his various declarations on the whole issue of imprisonment, that the level of serious crime in this country has decreased in an unprecedented way.</P>

      <P>The Government's policies are working, not least in the provision of additional prison accommodation, which Deputy Higgins and Fine Gael oppose. Obviously nothing can convince Deputy Higgins or his party of the efficacy of the policies being pursued. If the statistics gathered in precisely the same manner as they were prior to my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not convince the Deputy and his party of the appropriateness of the policies being pursued, nothing will.</P>
      <P>I have never been of the view that imprisonment of itself is the panacea to the crime problem but I am firmly of the view that the point has been passed whereby we can tolerate the release of people into society out of our prisons on the sole criterion that there is an insufficiency of space for them. That is something which is unsustainable and which could only serve to undermine the entire criminal justice system, not least because it saps the morale of the gardaí, infuriates the public, fuels crime and, unquestionably, brings the entire system into disrepute.</P>

      <P>It is clear at this point that we will end the revolving door syndrome and we will end this form of early release which, unquestionably, has caused so much difficulty for so many years. In doing so, I am convinced we will succeed in bringing crime figures down even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there are other methods which must be applied, and Deputy Higgins mentioned some of those. It would be wrong of me not to acknowledge and accept that we must encourage and develop other ways also but, unfortunately, there are people for whom the ultimate sanction of imprisonment is not just desirable but an imperative. It has been established in every other <Col N="123" /> society, and nobody will accept this could be a coincidence, that the reduction in the number of early releases from Mountjoy Prison coincided with a reduction in crime.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to denigrate Deputy Higgins's Bill. I acknowledge there are some good ideas in it which are worth considering. I look forward to honouring the Government's commitment to bring forward legislation to deal with attachment of earnings but that legislation will be practicable, practical and effective and will take account of the better points in Deputy Higgins's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I recognise the sadness of the occasion, following the death of Deputy Upton. I knew him very well and we were elected to the Seanad on the same day. We enjoyed many a joke and chuckled about many of the events that took place there. The late Deputy Upton was vociferous on justice issues when he was his party's spokesman on Justice in this House. He will be deeply missed by all of us who knew him well and by his family.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, 1998, and I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins for his initiative in bringing it before the House. This issue has been discussed since the early 1990s when the Law Reform Commission completed a report on it. The commission was quite clear in its approach that the issue should be taken on board and dealt with by the Minister at the time. It is extremely disappointing that the current Minister has displayed a negative response to Deputy Higgins's initiative. It is short sighted and I urge the Minister to reconsider the situation.</P>
      <P>At present, the State's approach is to put in prison those who default in paying fines or civil debts. Surely, in the context of our present prison regime, it is nonsensical that such people should take up spaces in our prisons. We put people in prison for failure to pay fines while those who have committed really serious crimes are released early due to lack of space. We put civil debtors in prison while the State cannot put fully into practise the people's decision that those who are likely to commit serious crime while on bail be remanded in custody. This cannot be enforced because of the prison regime, yet we are prepared to imprison those who fail to pay fines or civil debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It costs £47,000 per year to keep a prisoner behind bars. Some 20 per cent of people are committed to prison for non-payment of fines or debts. We must seek alternatives to this system. Deputy Higgins's Bill is a sensible and logical way <Col N="124" /> of dealing with the problem while freeing up prison spaces for those who commit serious crime and ensuring they serve their full sentences. It is sensible to empower a court to make an attachment of earnings order where it is satisfied that the fine defaulter or civil debtor is receiving a wage or salary. It is also sensible that an attachment order should be made to the social welfare payments of those who do not pay fines or who default on debts.</P>
    <P>In many cases the present system is falling into disrepute. We hear on an ongoing basis from the Garda Síochána of cases where, at the expense of the State, defaulters are conveyed to prison, only for the gardaí to find them back on the streets the following morning because there were no prison places.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the situation with regard to the decrease in crime. However, there is a level of despair regarding the many crimes that are not reported because people do not believe anything can be done about them. There is less and less reporting of crimes, including burglaries and break-ins.</P>
    <P>I have serious concerns regarding the statistics the Minister quoted. Since many people are convinced that nothing can be done, many crimes go unreported and, therefore, do not appear in the Minister's statistics. Many people are afraid to open their doors after 7 or 8 o'clock at night. We all experience this, especially at election time. People living on their own are frightened when someone calls to the door. The situation is in sharp contrast to that in previous generations when the door was always off the latch and people came and went from house to house at their ease.</P>
    <P>There should be a wider system of on the spot fines to tackle crime. The Minister introduced this measure recently, but it is an area that should be developed. There should also be provision for payment of fines by instalment, as well as confiscation of property and attendance at treatment centres. It is important that restitution should be made to victims of crime as part of a sentence, especially for minor crimes. People who commit serious crimes should serve their full sentence, with time off granted only for good behaviour. This would reduce the level of prison occupancy and ensure that those who commit serious offences know they will be subject to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>It is absurd for our prisons to be clogged up with minor offenders at a cost to the taxpayer of almost £800 per week for each prisoner. Prisons should be reserved for those who commit serious crimes against persons and property. The present system leads to overcrowding, early release and prisons being a breeding ground for crime. Some 2,000 committals are made annually for non-payment of fines and debts.</P>
    <P>The Government should recognise that victims of crime are in many ways those who are most <Col N="125" /> neglected by our criminal justice system. Every one of the criminal offences reported annually involves a person who suffered injury &ndash; often serious and sometimes fatal &ndash; or damage to their property. In most cases the system neither takes into account the trauma and loss suffered by them nor provides adequate mechanisms for compensation or restitution. Justice and common sense dictate a major change of approach in the way we deal with the victims of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to sympathise with the widow and family of the late Deputy Pat Upton.</P>
      <P>I want to speak briefly about the attitude taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in concentrating on prisons rather than the probation service. In his speech the Minister talked about providing 1,200 extra prison places by the end of the year, yet he paid scant regard to the expansion of the probation and welfare service. By the Minister's own calculations, some 10,950 prison days per annum are taken up by minor offenders. It costs £46,000 per year to keep someone in prison. It is crucially important that we develop our probation service by putting resources into it. For example, the probation service at Castlerea prison is hugely under-resourced. Even with the increase of prisoners in Castlerea, there still has not been a corresponding increase in the probation service.</P>
      <P>People who commit minor crimes, including failure to pay small fines, should be required to do community service such as cleaning up graveyards. This issue, which I brought to the attention of the Minister quite recently, can help local community organisations while at the same time be of benefit to the whole justice system. One example of that concerns an adolescent who broke a bottle in a street. He was ordered by the court to pick up rubbish in his own estate. That young man will not break another bottle on the street, and imprisoning him would not have solved the problem.</P>
      <P>It is crucially important that when we have an opportunity to do so, funding should be put into the probation and welfare service. Minor offenders should be required to clean up graveyards and other small tasks that at present are being done under community employment schemes. The Government's intention is to reduce the number of community employment schemes, which will leave a void for local organisations. It could be filled by those on probation. Minor offenders are often sent to prison where they pick up further bad habits. If they were not sent to prison, according to the Minister's conservative calculation, an additional 10,000 or 11,000 prison spaces would be freed up. If the probation service was extended, more prison places would be freed up without the need to extend our prisons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in marking the memory of the late Deputy Upton. Had he been here, undoubtedly he would have made an interesting and enthusiastic contribution. I join previous speakers in offering my sympathy to his family on their sad and tragic loss.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins introduced his Bill by saying that while it was published many months ago he did not press it until now because he wished to allow the Minister an opportunity to introduce his legislation. Alas that did not happen. That is further evidence of the folly of the Taoiseach and the Government in amalgamating the Department of Justice and the former Department of Equality and Law Reform. The latter Department reached many milestones in terms of the enactment of reforms in the civil legislative code under a fine Minister, Mervyn Taylor. I hope at some future date, perhaps with an early change of Government, the former Department of Equality and Law Reform will be constituted. The Department under the auspices of the Minister is not a reforming one. It is not headed by a Minister who is on top of his brief. Legislation on the A list last term is now on the B list and some Bills do not appear on the list. The matter of law reform is little short of a shambles.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that in spite of our difficulties we are fortunate to live in a country that is among the safer countries in the world in which to reside. Leaving aside terrorism related activities, of which there have been many during the past 30 years, if one travels across the Border to Northern Ireland the crime rate there is some 30 per cent higher than that here.</P>
      <P>It is important that we give greater credence and recognition to different categories of crime in the context of custodial prison sentences. It is important to run through the profile of the many burglaries and attacks on persons in the form of theft, armed robberies, muggings, stabbings and malicious damage which occur on a nightly basis. There is a recurring theme. The perpetrators of these acts are predominantly young, male, come from disadvantaged areas, have low educational attainment and, more often than not, are engaged in activities closely related to drugs. The issues of poverty and marginalisation, education retardation, socio-economic deprivation are features of the bulk of criminal activity. Our criminal justice system cannot deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inadequacies of our prison system were outlined by Deputy Higgins. This Bill is designed to respond to those inadequacies and it is extraordinary that the Minister is not prepared to accept it as a reforming measure. Our criminal justice system cannot deal with the problem because the time honoured solutions are not working as our prisons creak at the seams. We need a multi-agency approach of a type recommended in Deputy Higgins's Bill and elaborated on by Deputy Naughten. The Minister said we <Col N="127" /> need to encourage and look at new ways to deal with the problem. Yet the new ways put forward by Deputy Higgins are not the Minister's ways.</P>
    <P>This problem could be dealt with by way of a restorative justice model. I refer specifically to the New Zealand model. I ask the Minister to introduce that model here with particular reference to combating youth crime. Most of us would agree prison should always remain a place of last resort. However, prisoner statistics tell a different tale. Most offenders given prison sentences by the courts are those who commit non-violent offences against property or offences one could describe as less serious, such as offences under the road traffic code, bad debts referred to by Deputy Higgins and drink related offences.</P>
    <P>The annual cost of £46,000 for keeping a prisoner is excessive and unnecessary. Chronic overcrowding of our prisons leads to the infamous revolving door syndrome; resulting in a crisis in our prison system. The Minister said he is tackling the problem, but there is not any great evidence of that. He said people may lose confidence in our prison regime, but I would go further and say they have lost confidence in it. The most important function of our criminal justice system must be the prevention of reoffending and the concept of rehabilitation by encouraging the offender back to a normal and responsible life. For most offenders, prison means low self-esteem, a loss of home, family ties and social and economic support. A term in prison makes return to normal life extremely difficult for many people. It allows them to drift into a sad cycle of repeated criminal behaviour. They drift from crime to prison and from prison to crime and are caught in a vicious circle of deprivation and hopelessness.</P>
    <P>The New Zealand model breaks the cycle of criminal behaviour and it works well. If such a system was applied here, it would involve the health boards to a great degree and a beefed up welfare and probation service, which the Minister refuses to fund. The cost involved would not be the major issue the Minister maintains it would be because we would have to take account of the savings on our astronomical prisons bill.</P>
    <P>A restorative justice system involves the community, the victim of the offence and State agencies involved in providing help and assistance for the offender. Community service and involvement in local development issues will help offenders realise their place in society and understand the offences and the damage they inflicted on the community by their anti-social behaviour. Repeated rhetoric from the &ldquo;lock them up and throw away the key brigade&rdquo; does nothing to tackle crime or its causes and does not have a place in our criminal justice system. As the National Crime Forum has praised the New Zealand model, I hope the Minister will go further <Col N="128" /> and introduce it, if not in its entirety at least as a pilot scheme, particularly in regard to dealing with youth crime. I urge the Minister to do that without delay.</P>
    <P>Some of the points raised by Deputy Higgins bear repetition because of their importance. He listed the inadequacies of our prison system. In many cases remand prisoners, who have not been found guilty of any offence, spend more time than convicted criminals in prison. It is extraordinary that one-third of our prisoners are under 21. Seventy-six per cent were committed to prison for non-violent offences. I want the Minister to tell us what provision he is introducing to allow prison officers to become involved in the treatment, rehabilitation, counselling and other elements which might constitute part of a plan to manage prisoners in an orderly and acceptable way. Deputy Higgins spoke about the report of the prison chaplains, which stated that rape and sexual assault are a reality in Irish prisons and that rape is almost certainly under-reported. Of course it is, because the Minister and his Department do not want to acknowledge it exists.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Minister's prison building mantra on increased spaces which we hear on a daily basis &ndash; I welcome the bulk of them &ndash; bricks and mortar accompanied only by locks and keys will not solve the problem in our criminal justice system. The Minister must look far beyond the provision of thousands of extra prison spaces; I welcome those he is creating in my constituency. However, the Minister should not use that as the solution to the problem in our criminal justice system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in extending my sympathy to the family of the late Deputy Upton. He is a great loss to this House and it is sad that a great man was taken at such a young age.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Higgins, on bringing forward this important Bill. I wish to raise the issue of how small debts orders are enforced in the District Court. An instalment order is obtained against the debtor and then served. If the debtor defaults on the instalment order, an application to commit the person to prison is then obtained. When the District Court judge makes an order committing the person to prison, a warrant is issued and sent to the Garda who must enforce it by arresting the person and conveying him or her to the nearest prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrest of a person and his or her detention in prison incurs considerable expense to the State which is never recovered. The present system allows debtors to be imprisoned with hardened criminals, which is unacceptable. The committal of a debtor to prison is of little benefit to the creditor as the debt remains outstanding; many people forget this. It results in a valuable prison <Col N="129" /> space being used by somebody who is not really a criminal and for whom prison was not designed.</P>
    <P>A far more appropriate way of enforcing judgments against those of inadequate means would be to have work orders made by the courts, under which the debtor could work for the creditor to pay off his or her debt. Alternatively, if the debtor is in receipt of social welfare, the court could make an attachment order whereby a certain amount could be deducted each week and paid to the creditor. It is important to bear in mind that the reduction in social welfare benefits might make a person worse off and leave him or her with no option but to apply to the health board for supplementary benefit, which is clearly undesirable. Accordingly, each case would have to be judged on its own merits as regards attachment orders.</P>
    <P>Scope must also be given to the courts to make orders whereby the debtor could be employed on community work schemes. The State would then pay the creditor for any work done. Large debts are enforced by obtaining orders for sale, as some form of security is given to the creditor by the debtor. The present system for enforcement of these debts works fairly well but huge improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of credit ratings. Loans are widely available and some people may have difficulty in repaying them. A constituent came to my office some weeks ago who told me he and his wife are working but some years ago they had difficulty in repaying a debt and a judgment was made against them. Their credit rating was affected to the extent that they were unable to borrow any money. In certain cases there should be a time limit on the retention of information on bad debts. A person can fail to repay a small amount of money at a young age but his or her credit rating is affected for years. This should be looked at, as a consumer should be given a second chance.</P>
    <P>This is a well-thought out Bill and proposes many alternatives which would reduce the amount of Garda time spent arresting people. Last week, I received a phone call from a person whose husband was fined. He had a serious medical condition and was unable to pay the fine. She was frightened her husband would be arrested. These proposed alternatives should be looked at. Something must be done. White collar crime is a huge problem. People are stealing huge amounts and those with little money are suffering.</P>
    <P>The proposal for new court services provides a good opportunity for the Minister to introduce new ways to process summonses. People who are unable to borrow money but are prepared to pay fines over a reasonable period should be allowed to pay in instalments. Some of the money invested in building prisons could be diverted to alternatives to encourage people to work in the community as a form of payment. While this <Col N="130" /> would be hard to administer, as Deputy Naughten said, a great deal of work can be done under community service.</P>
    <P>Security costs are huge for businesses trying to prevent crime. There are definitely places in prison for criminals who leave cities and come to country towns. I endorse the Minister's efforts to ensure their apprehension and detention. However, those who are unable to pay fines but are willing to find an alternative should be given a chance, without involving the utilisation of Garda and judicial resources. There is a way around that. Deputy Higgins has proposed innovative alternatives and the Minister should take them on board.</P>
    <P>Given the new technology, priority should be given to the processing of summonses. Eleven million pounds is being spent throughout the country under the new Courts Orders Act. There should be uniformity of fines as one District Court judge can be at variance with another, which is disquieting for people. District Court judges should be familiar with fines for similar offences.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at the information retained by the credit bureau on people who have had summonses issued against them. After a number of years, their files should be updated to allow them obtain credit again. It is important that their lives should not be curtailed because they have no credit facilities. I congratulate Deputy Higgins on his innovative Bill. I appeal to the Minister to take it on board as it is the way forward.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins on his Private Members' Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, 1998, and on providing us with an opportunity to discuss some very important issues which relate to the non-payments of fines or debts. I am aware of the four expert reports dating back to 1984 and the recommendation on fine defaulters and civil debts. I question why no real progress has been made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on those recommendations which I understand would not be far removed from the principles contained in the Private Members' Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the enormous effort of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, since he took over responsibility from his predecessor, Deputy <Col N="131" /> Owen. I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on the prison building programme. Such programme had an abrupt execution in the previous rainbow Coalition when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, was missing from the Cabinet table. We then had the revolving door prison syndrome. I hold a very strong view that when punishment for offence is necessary the punishment should fit the crime. It was totally unacceptable that the then Government's response to a person convicted of a crime was the oiling of the revolving door. Crime figures are dropping, but the incidence of serious and vicious crime is escalating. To this end, I welcome the current prison building programme which should ensure appropriate accommodation is provided to all prisoners and stop the revolving door syndrome.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year more than 1,200 extra prison places will have been provided by this Fianna Fáil-led Government. I understand that, in the course of the next few years, we will increase our prison places from 2,200 to in excess of 4,400 which I welcome. I listened to the contributions from speakers on the Opposition benches on the cost of prison places and that we should not build prisons and incarcerate the prisoners. I do not believe the Minister intends to do what the Opposition is suggesting, but I hope Members will concur with me that we send out a clear message to the perpetrators of serious and vicious crime that they will go to prison and stay there until they pay their debt to society, that an example will be made of those who are convicted by the courts. I would like to think everybody agrees with that, contrary to what I have heard so far tonight.</P>
    <P>I support and encourage the use of alternatives to custody, especially fines, probation, compensation orders and community service in appropriate cases. I am disappointed to note the Bill before us could undermine the existing system for the payment of fines, prove difficult to administer and be a huge administrative burden for the courts, the Garda Síochána and the Probation Service. In this context, I draw the Minister's attention to the first report of the expert group under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Brian McCarthy and the urgent need to put in place a satisfactory structure in each area and the staffing needs of the probation and welfare service. Given the glaring gaps in the staffing requirements to which he refers in the first report there is need for a rapid response to the staffing needs which we should put in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan praised the New Zealand model. I am not sure if the Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Jim Higgins, is aware &ndash; Deputy Flanagan is not &ndash; that juvenile crime is going through the roof in New Zealand. The facts speak for themselves. I am sure if Deputy Flanagan was <Col N="132" /> aware of those facts he would not be promoting the New Zealand model.</P>
    <P>We agree that a person who fails to pay a fine or civil debt should not be put through the expensive process of being put behind bars. The present system is crazy. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has put on record that we will see the introduction of an appropriate mechanism such as contained in the Bill which is workable. I acknowledge the determination of the Government to have an efficient, practical and effective court system. I have every confidence in the court services meeting the challenges under the chief executive, Mr. P.J. Fitzpatrick, who must be recognised as one of the best administrators. I welcome and look forward to the radical improvement in the court services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley:</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have said, a shadow is cast over this debate because of the untimely death of Dr. Pat Upton. He and I were elected to the Seanad on the same day in 1989 and developed a great friendship. I express my deepest sympathy to his wife and family and to his party.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us proposes that a court or an application to it may make an attachment of earnings order in the case of a person who has defaulted on a fine. This would require the person's employer to deduct the amount specified by the court. In addition, it contains a provision for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to make deductions from persons entitled to income support. Further provisions in the Bill allow for the fines to be paid by instalment and community service to be substituted where a person has defaulted on a fine and the appointment by the court of a probation and welfare officer to supervise the person for the purpose of assisting and advising him or her in regard to payment of the fine. The Minister is concerned that the proposals as they stand could have adverse implications for the payment of fines in that people who pay fines at present do so on the understanding that their failure to do so would lead to imprisonment and they may now be prepared to take their chance with the alternatives in the case of non-payment. These alternatives would involve further court hearings and a considerable amount of administrative work, and this could prove very costly even taking into account an improvement in the level of fines paid. In effect, the Bill contains no controlling criteria other than non-payment where these mechanisms might come into play and in the absence of such criteria very substantial public expenditure could be incurred in pursuing very small amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions on attachment in the case of income support raises a very complex issue which will require further consideration. There is no provision for payment of fines by instalment at <Col N="133" /> present and the courts are not geared to provide such a service. Nevertheless, it should be examined in conjunction with the new courts service and, in particular, against the background of the major investment of £11 million in new IT which has been authorised for the courts. The Minister has serious doubts that an attachment of earnings scheme would be appropriate in the absence of people being able to make payments by instalment. I understand the Minister believes that attachment to earnings would have a role to play if carefully focused, but he is anxious to avoid a situation whereby the present system of fine collection would be undermined by the introduction of the general provision included in the Private Members' Bill. The Minister has stated that his Department, in consultation with the new court services, will continue to work on proposals in this regard with a view to bringing forward a draft scheme as soon as possible. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the petition system which I believe dealt in a compassionate way with many deserving cases.</P>
    <P>There has been public comment to the effect that the Bill has been brought forward in the context of easing pressure on prison accommodation.  While the higher number of committals to prison impose a burden on the prison service, only approximately 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent of prisoners are in prison for non-payment of fines. A number of them are held in the open centres where the spaces might otherwise not be filled due to a reluctance on the part of many prisoners to be transferred to open centres.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, claims that proposals in the Bill would lead to an improvement in the pressure on existing prison accommodation are without foundation. The Government deserves congratulations on its prison building programme. This will stop the revolving door problem, allow the Bail Act to be implemented and permit the essential refurbishment of certain prisons.</P>
    <P>The Government has been willing to put essential funding into the criminal justice system which is why crime rates are falling and, I hope, will continue to fall. The Minister opposes the Bill on the basis that it would undermine the operation of the present fines system and it could prove expensive to operate.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Higgins on his Bill. The proposals, while well intentioned, could undermine the present fines system which is the most widely used alternative to custody. I welcome the Minister's commitment to address the issues raised in the Bill. Since his appointment, he has had 19 Bills enacted which is a measure of the Government's commitment to law reform.</P>

      <P>I express my sympathy to the wife and family of the late Deputy Upton. In recent months I made Deputy Upton's acquaintance and <Col N="134" /> gained his friendship. We had something in common because he was a native of west Clare and he had many relatives in Ballylanders, which is in my constituency. I also offer my sympathy to the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Higgins on preparing the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, 1998. A great deal of preparatory work was put into bringing the Bill before the House. However, it is unacceptable. It is ill conceived. I will outline my argument in the limited time available.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives power to the courts to attach the earnings and social welfare payments of debtors. It requires an employer to comply with the provisions of an attachment order and a debtor to provide a statement of earnings or particulars of payments due. This will also apply to all persons and employees working in the Civil Service and in State agencies. The Bill also includes provisions on the payment of fines by instalments.</P>
      <P>It proposes that a court, on application to it, may make an attachment of earnings order in the case of a person who has defaulted on a fine or a debt. This would require the person's employer to deduct the amount specified by the court. In addition, the Bill contains provisions for the Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs to make deductions from persons entitled to income support. Further provisions permit fines to be paid by instalment, community service to be substituted where a person has defaulted on a fine or debt and the appointment by the court of a probation and welfare officer to supervise the person for the purpose of assisting the debtor in the payment of the fine.</P>
      <P>I would support the processes if I thought they would assist in enforcing judicial decisions in a uniform and comprehensive manner. However, on reflection, it appears the only purpose the Bill will serve is to add bureaucratic layers to the justice system and give the impression that imprisonment will never be an option to be considered in the case of fine defaulters. This is the kernel of the issue.</P>
      <P>These proposals could have adverse implications for the payment of fines. People pay fines at present on the understanding that failure to do so could lead to imprisonment. They might now take the view that they would be prepared to take their chances with the alternatives provided for in the Bill for such non-payment. If this Bill is passed, it will dilute our national criminal code, which is based on the premise that punishment for offences is carried out to the letter of the law at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternatives to the payment of fines which are proposed in the Bill would also mean extra bureaucratic layers of administration being added to our national courts service. That would be unwelcome. These alternatives in turn would involve extra court hearings and a considerable amount of administrative work which could prove <Col N="135" /> costly even taking into account any improvement in the level of fines paid as a result of the proposals. The Bill contains no controlling criteria other than non-payment for when these mechanisms might come into play and, in the absence of such criteria, substantial public expenditure could be incurred in garnering a little money for the coffers of the State.</P>
    <P>There is no provision to pay fines by instalment at present and our court system is simply not geared to accommodate the administration of such a practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in expressing shock at the death of Deputy Pat Upton. Pat was an honourable man and a good parliamentarian. I was a Member of the Seanad with Pat before we became Members of the Dáil and I was absolutely shocked to hear of his death. No matter how bad a political situation was, Pat was always able to look at the amusing side. He could find a good angle to make everybody laugh at the situation or at themselves. That was a great part of his personality and I will always remember it. I offer my condolences to his family and to the Labour Party on their great loss.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Higgins on introducing this Bill. It takes a great deal of time and effort to bring a Private Members' Bill before the House. The Minister, when he was in Opposition, brought forward a number of such measures and I was involved in the preparation of two of them so I am aware of the amount of work required. There is little back-up and one can make mistakes without realising it until the last moment. It makes one realise the amount of work done by civil servants and appreciate the back-up available to a Minister when drafting legislation.</P>
      <P>The idea behind the Bill is good. However, it is probably a little premature. The Government has given a large commitment to the Minister's programme. There are huge problems in the prison system with the revolving door syndrome, a shortage of prison places and poor prison accommodation. The Minister has put a great deal of work into improving the prisons and has introduced 19 Bills since his appointment. The Oireachtas Committee which I chair does not wish to encourage him to produce too many more Bills because it is anxious to do other things. We find it difficult to find the time to keep up with the Minister and to examine other areas and ideas within our remit. We should be doing more of the latter but it is difficult given the number of Bills coming before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should be re-examined when most of the Minister's programme is in place. Some of its ideas are quite good. However, one of the problems I have with the legislation is the message that will be sent to people who pay fines at present if there is no chance of further penalties. <Col N="136" /> Many people might decide to take a chance and see what would happen if they avoided paying the fines. There would be extra work and expense involved in collecting small amounts of money. I am not convinced this would achieve what the Deputy intends, it could be a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the new court service could examine some of the proposals and that he would consider some of the points raised in the Bill. I am delighted he will do that and introduce legislation if he feels it is necessary.</P>
    <P>The number of people involved is interesting. Between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent of the prison population is in prison for non-payment of fines. That is a small number of people and would not make much difference to the problem of prison overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Some of the Bill's provisions should be examined and I congratulate the Deputy on introducing it.</P>

      <P>I dteannta le daoine eile sa Teach seo, tá mé i mo bhall den Chomhchoiste um Dhlí agus Ceart, Comhionnanas agus Cearta na mBan, mar a bhí an tUasal Pat Upton. Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh lena chlann agus le Pairtí an Lucht Oibre as ucht na cailliúna móire. Ba Ghaeilgeoir mhín lách é Pat Upton. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>I am also a member of the subcommittee on crime and punishment which is ably chaired by Deputy Higgins. One of the topics we are examining is financial penalties and the use of prison. We have worked on this for a number of months and that work is ongoing. I had hoped we would have all-party agreement on a report with recommendations which would be sent to the Minister from which some good might come. For that reason this Bill is premature. While I commend Deputy Higgins on introducing the Bill, it might be naive to expect him to wait until we had finished our work on the committee. That is politics.</P>
      <P>The use of prison is undesirable. Incarceration has huge social consequences. It is, however, an effective deterrent. In Ireland we use prison extensively. Our crime rate is one of the lowest in Europe and continues to fall. Countries such as Sweden and Denmark, which have the lowest use of prison, have the highest level of recorded crime. Much as we may not like it, prison is a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not, however, want prison to be used as an automatic sanction for every crime. The figures for the use of prison for non-payment of debts, default of sureties, contempt of court and default of fines are exaggerated. Successive replies to Parliamentary Questions given by Ministers for Justice over the years show that at any one time only 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent of the prison population &ndash; approximately 30 people &ndash; is in prison because of non-payment of fines. The <Col N="137" /> number committed and the number who serve time in prison is vastly different. If a judgment is made in a civil debt, the person can go before the District Court, file a statement of means and the judge can decide what he or she can afford. It is only then, if that person refuses to pay, that an order to be committed is made. That threat is obviously enough to make people pay. This Bill may challenge judicial determination. If we remove the sanction, people may not pay at all.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to deduct fines from social welfare. Social welfare is a minimum payment to people which takes into account many elements such as the number of dependants and so on. The Bill might be unconstitutional in its arbitrary nature &ndash; something which needs to be considered further.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if a fine is imposed on a person, he or she should pay it. I am not convinced that removing fine defaulters from prison would solve the problems. That would be a long and slow process. When one considers the recommendations on targeting educational resources, the wise expenditure of youth funds, the treatment and rehabilitation of prisoners and positive sentence management &ndash; measures which have been recommended in various reports over the years and which are currently being undertaken by the Government &ndash; it is obvious that a great deal needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I look forward, as a member of the committee, to visiting the prisons to see at first hand the conditions so that I may be able to bring some useful comments to the work of the committee in formulating future policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Higgins on the work involved in this Bill. On going through its provisions, the items which struck me were employment and poverty. This Bill seeks to make employers responsible for attachment of earnings orders, but the number of people who are self-employed or working on contract is growing and this should be addressed. People on social welfare are on the lowest possible income and to legislate in this way would need a great deal of care and attention.</P>
      <P>Section 3(b) states that the Bill would apply to persons who have defaulted on the payment of a civil debt. People on the poverty line often buy videos and washing machines on hire purchase, putting them in a position where they have a debt which they cannot afford to repay. In such circumstances the attitude should be &ldquo;contractor beware&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;buyer beware&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(2) states that the order should be directed at the employer. It is possible that employment would be jeopardised by the provisions of this Bill. Who would decide on the protected earnings rate? A court is not the right body to make such a decision. There should be some form of appeals system whereby a social worker, <Col N="138" /> an employee of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and a welfare recipient, who lives on a low income, would decide in this matter.</P>
    <P>An employer is given ten days to comply with an attachment of earnings order. Even the Revenue Commissioners give more than ten days, they normally give a minimum of 20 days and in excess of a month in some cases.</P>
    <P>Compliance with an attachment of earnings order would involve a huge amount of bureaucracy for an employer which, in many cases, would be for minimal amounts. It would cause many employers to think twice before employing people. An employer could be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months if he or she does not comply with the Bill. An attachment of earnings order would be good reason for many employers to consider the continuation of a person's employment. The court may apply to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs asking to deduct sums from any amounts payable to a defaulter. Here again people who do not have enough money to live on will have money taken from them. The idea of community service being used instead of fines must be looked at more extensively as we are talking about small amounts of money. The cost to both employers and the administrative services creates a significant problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill deserves more thought and one can see the amount of work put into it. It is good to have it as a basis for further discussion and I look forward to participating in that discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and all Deputies who have contributed for their very kind comments about our late colleague, Dr. Pat Upton. I followed him into the justice brief. It was a tremendous shock to all of us to hear on Monday morning of his sudden and unexpected death. I thank the Minister, Deputy Higgins, and the House for facilitating my input in this debate. I, like all Members of our Parliamentary party, wanted to be present at the removal of Pat's remains, and I appreciate the great solidarity the party has experienced with Members on all sides and the respect shown to Pat. I know that has been of great help and sustenance to Anne and the family. Pat's eldest son was here yesterday for the tributes paid to him. It is important the family knows of the high regard in which Pat was held, not only by colleagues in the Labour Party, but by Members in all parties. I am very grateful for the remarks of individual Members in that regard tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is my first contribution on a criminal justice matter since my appointment to the justice brief. This is an important measure that deals with one of the core issues in this area &ndash; how to deal with offenders in a civilised country and how, as a compassionate people, we can learn <Col N="139" /> from international experience and devise, in a relatively low crime environment, a penal system that is appropriate to our needs and which could be a model for other countries. There is no need for us to repeat the mistakes of others, and there is no need for a knee-jerk reaction to perceived dangers in an evolving society. We should be careful and measured in how we react. Quite often a knee-jerk reaction is popular in the short-term. The general public can demand that politicians take a particular course of action to buy temporary popularity. However, that may cause lasting damage to our society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins first published this Bill in May 1998, which was a considerable length of time ago. I understand the reason it remained on the Order Paper but was not pursued in Private Members' time was to give the Minister a chance to advance his own legislation in this area, which was promised since his time in Opposition. I welcome the Bill, and, like other speakers, I congratulate Deputy Higgins for the obvious work that went into it.</P>
    <P>The Bill's main purpose is to enable the courts to deduct money from the income of fine defaulters and civil debtors rather than to send them to prison. This is a laudable objective and one this Legislature should pursue. In commenting on the detail of the Bill, I wish to be constructive and not critical of a very fine piece of work. The philosophy behind the Bill goes back to the report of the 1985 Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, chaired by Dr. Ken Whitaker, which called for the implementation of alternatives to prison. The Labour Party has long called for implementation of that report, and Senator Joe Costello in particular has campaigned for prison reform. He introduced a Bill to do just that in the 1989 to 1992 Seanad. Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil would not let that Bill be debated. The Labour Party election manifesto in 1997 again called for the implementation of the Whitaker report, and in that manifesto we committed ourselves to the introduction of a sentencing Bill to deal with all aspects of sentencing with a view to increasing the number of alternatives to prison available to the courts. The issues dealt with in the Bill are an important component part of that general approach.</P>
    <P>I hope to set the tone of my thinking in relation to my responsibilities in this area by looking at how our society regards prisons. My objective would be to reduce our dependence on the prison system. I do not jump up and down in delight at the notion that we are to provide 2,000 extra prison places. I do not rejoice in that as if it were a wonderful societal achievement for Ireland as we approach the new millennium. I wish we did not need such places, and I question whether we need that number.</P>
    <P>When in a previous Government I met the <Col N="140" /> Deputy Premier of the State of Victoria, who was also the Prisons Minister, on behalf of the Government when he came to Ireland. He was going back to Australia after visiting penal institutions in a number of American States. I would not characterise him as being soft. He was a hard nosed and strong minded Australian, but he said he had been horrified by some of the prisons he had seen in America. He described them as human warehouses and said that society had decided to deal with people it did not want on its streets by sending them off to a human warehouse where they could be locked away for the longest time possible. We have seen the introduction of regimes such as &ldquo;three strikes and you're out&rdquo;, where three consecutive convictions, even those for relatively minor offences, can lead to a life sentence without remission. There is a fundamental flaw in a society that develops like that, and we should look very carefully at how that society is developing before we try to reflect or emulate it here.</P>
    <P>The French based body, International Prison Watch, confirmed last year that it now costs £900 per week to keep an offender in an Irish prison. It does not make sense to me that a person can be put in prison for a civil debt or the non-payment of a fine which could be very much less than the weekly cost of keeping that person in prison. The Minister said the numbers are relatively small in saying that committals for the non-payment of fines and debts in 1996 amounted to about 18 per cent of all committals to custody. Eighteen per cent strikes me as a significant amount and if we could reduce our prison population by that amount we would have done a fairly good job in saving money for the taxpayer. He also said that at any given time the number of prison places being occupied by people in this category amounts to between 1 and 1.5 per cent of the prison population. That tells me that sending people to prison for only ten minutes is meaningless. We are all aware of people who have been sent to prison overnight. In our individual clinics we deal with clients who have road traffic offences and fines imposed on them and the Garda has to enforce the court order. Sometimes the Garda tell poor people they will be detained only overnight, that they will be back the next day, that the offence can be wiped out but that the court order has to be enforced.</P>
    <P>That is no way to institute proper justice. Some of these fines would be meaningless to somebody with money in their pocket and a good income but they can have an extraordinary impact on those who have a meagre income or are dependent on social welfare. The notion of committing people to prison, simply because of their poverty, while others pay a fine which does not impact on their resources, underscores a clear injustice in society. We must keep under review the need for <Col N="141" /> 2,000 additional places which will involve an additional annual expenditure of £90 million.</P>
    <P>Crime in Ireland is low by international standards. The Minister said the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government policies are obviously successful because the crime rate is falling. Yet we need to build 2,000 extra places and are unwilling, even in a modest way, to address the issues by accepting the Bill in principle. I recognise the Bill has flaws but it can be amended on Committee Stage. People on the Opposition side do not have the drafting supports to produce perfect Bills. Dare I say, with all due respect, having sat on the Government side, Bills produced on the far side are not always flawless. If the principle is a good one it should be accepted. I have not heard many argue against it. Let us use the committees of the House to make a good Bill better.</P>
    <P>I am worried about serious violence and about the increase in the number of murders. In terms of overall crime we do not need to build new prison places to hold our murderers. There are sufficient places for them if they can be tracked down. I pay tribute to the Garda which is fairly adept at doing just that. Most crime is larceny and most larceny is petty larceny involving property under a value of £200. If larceny is under a value of £200 and people are committed to prison at a cost of £900 per week, there is something askew in that logic.</P>
    <P>Some interesting facts about the prison population should be put on the record. The 1996 criminal statistics for England and Wales states that the Irish penal system sent many people to prison. Our prison population per 100,000 crimes recorded is 2,120. Ireland is at the top of the list, with the exception of Northern Ireland. The peculiarities of Northern Ireland need not be explained here. France is next with 1,520 per 100,000 recorded crimes, followed by Austria, England and Wales, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway with 880, Denmark with 600 and Sweden with 510. Why has Ireland four times as many as Sweden or Denmark given that there are alternatives to prison? It does not indicate that prison is effective since Sweden, Denmark and Norway commit fewer people per crime to prison. Instead those countries seek alternatives. Contrary to the view put forward by Deputy Callely there is no direct correlation between sending people to jail and crime. The lower committal rates in the Scandinavian countries indicate there are alternatives to prison that can be as effective a deterrent for recidivism.</P>
    <P>Given the extra prison places being provided at significant financial cost, we could close down some of those prisons where slopping out is still the practice. The Richardson case in 1980 said the Government had a duty to abolish slopping out. Some 20 years later that is still an objective. It is unthinkable that those Victorian conditions could <Col N="142" /> still exist. There would be a consensus in this House if the women's prison in Limerick, which is in a dreadful condition, were to be closed. I have not yet had the opportunity to visit it but I hope to do so with the consent of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not know whether the Minister of State, who has a particular interest in these matters, would take it upon herself to look at that women's prison. There are only a small number of women prisoners there. The conditions are poor and the prison should not exist. There is a new women's prison in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of putting women into prison in Ireland is a relatively new phenomenon. We have no tradition of committing large numbers of women to prison. It is not something that characterised the Irish penal system, although it is growing. Many of the women in prison should not be there and only some would merit a custodial sentence. Many were involved in petty repeat shoplifting and similar type offences. Prison is not an appropriate place for those women.</P>
    <P>Another issue which is of great importance is that of drugs in Mountjoy. We need to get to grips with this problem. It is clear many of those who are committed to Mountjoy have a drug habit. I know something about this problem given my responsibilities when Minister for Health in trying to tackle those on the outside. It appears drugs are available in Mountjoy Prison. I do not condemn the governor &ndash; a progressive and good man &ndash; or his staff. Unless we had a regime in place that would be unacceptable on grounds of human rights, it is impossible to screen for drugs in every circumstance. However, we have to do better. Above all we have to provide opportunities for people to be drug free. That is not being done.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a new prisons agency. When will the legislation for such an agency be published? Some time ago I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when the interim board would be appointed, and I was told &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. We need to see progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with a comment by a Fine Gael colleague about the pressures on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has by far the longest list of Bills pending on the Dáil Order Paper. It was a serious mistake to destroy the Department of Equality and Law Reform and subsume it into the Department of Justice &ndash; I say this in the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for equality. It denied &ldquo;equality&rdquo; a voice at Cabinet. The Minister for Justice has enough responsibilities under the criminal justice system and with regard to Northern Ireland. Having served in two Governments with a Minister for Equality and Law Reform as an advocate for equality matters, I know the importance of this and it should be put right, if <Col N="143" /> not by this Administration, then by a future one in which my party will be involved. I would dearly like this restored, not only because of the fundamental right to have a voice for &ldquo;equality&rdquo; at Cabinet, but because it is impossible for some matters to get priority within the current Department as it is too clogged with other matters. A separate Department would streamline the system and would be a good initiative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Courts Agency and the appointment of Mr. P.J. Fitzpatrick as its chief executive. I have had many dealings with him as a most able health administrator and wish him well in this extremely difficult and onerous job. I hope it will be acknowledged that the courts and prison agencies do not absolve the Minister of responsibility to this House. There is a tendency, not exclusive to the current Administration, for agencies to be established and become unaccountable &ndash; one cannot ask direct questions about the NRA and the EPA, they are now a law unto themselves somewhere in the ether. Ministers are responsible and accountable to this House and the new committee system should be used to its fullest extent to ensure new agencies regularly report to the democratically elected Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of prison conditions is the treatment of sex offenders. The Curragh camp has about 100 prisoners, who have neither a probation and welfare service nor a social worker. Arbour Hill Prison has ten treatment places per year for sex offenders. This is not adequate. If we are serious about dealing with sex offenders &ndash; not locking them up and releasing them with a potential to re-offend and do harm, but treating them to see whether we can ensure they will do no further harm &ndash; treatment must be an important element of their sentences. It is not available to them at present &ndash; obviously they must opt for it, but there are few places even for those who do.</P>
    <P>There is a huge requirement to invest in the probation and welfare service, as others have said already this evening. In November 1997 the Government set up an independent expert group on the service and the Minister published its first report on 2 November 1998. Its main recommendation was that the number of basic grade probation and welfare officers should be increased from 148.5 to 225, with appropriate increases in the number of senior and clerical support staff. The recommendation to increase the number of probation and welfare officers was costed at £2.5 million, which is no small sum, but set against the cost of prison places &ndash; £900 per prisoner per week &ndash; it is a worthwhile investment. If one believes in the need for a probation and welfare service of adequate proportion and accepts the expert group's report, action should be taken now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> The Minister suggested the implementation of the report's recommendations should be delayed until the group has produced its second report, on which it is currently working. There is no need for that &ndash; we know enough from the first report to get to grips with this issue and provide a beefed-up probation and welfare service that will take pressure off committals to prison and do a better job for society as a whole. I hope the Minister will take account of and act on that, rather than not making a decision and hiding behind the pending report. That is not good enough from a Minister who has characterised himself as a doer; although he was much louder in Opposition than in Government, which is an unfortunate state of affairs &ndash; we had occasion recently to quote his pre-Government and Government positions on the Immigration Bill. On so many areas, from zero tolerance to libertarian attitudes towards refugees, he has gone through a transformation since entering the dark portals of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in St. Stephen's Green. I do not know what they have done to him but he has changed fundamentally and he is not the man he was in Opposition, which surprises me not a little.</P>
    <P>Governments sometimes take a knee-jerk reaction to Opposition Bills &ndash; the civil servants' first move is to give reasons they should not be accepted. The lovely word always used in their first sentence is &ldquo;flawed&rdquo;&ndash; every Bill from the Opposition is flawed by definition, as if the creations of the parliamentary draftsman's office were never flawed, God protect us from that. In the last Administration there was the beginning of an acceptance that Bills should be taken on their merits &ndash; we have an elaborate committee system so we should take the principles of good Bills and run with them, and if we can create good legislation from the Opposition benches, we can make this House an effective Legislature rather than a rubber stamp for the Executive. The Executive should not be the creator of Bills, rather this House should be the shaper of legislation. Bills which have their genesis in the Opposition are just as valuable, in many instances more valuable, than those generated by the other side. There is a hope, perhaps an expectation, that backbenchers &ndash; even Government backbenchers &ndash; might generate Bills in the future, and that is a good practice, which currently happens in our neighbouring jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 3(b) applies the Bill's provisions to civil debt defaulters without specifying that a prior court judgment must exist. Is that intentional? In any case there is already provision in law for attachment of civil debtors and other similar remedies such as garnishee. In that context, we would like to see the case made as to why the additional provisions of this Bill are necessary. However, we certainly support the notion that they are necessary in the criminal context and wish to see more <Col N="145" /> extensive remedies along civil lines, such as a garnishee, where a specific sum rather than a regular income is due to the fine defaulter.</P>
    <P>I wish to query the rationale behind section 3(a) &ndash; this point was already raised on the Government side &ndash; and state that it is too limited in that it can only become operative&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 6 May last a headline in the newspapers indicated that fine defaulters would face pay cuts, not prison. I have not had time to read the Minister's contribution to this debate but he stated that this will not happen for some time. If that is the case, he should accept the Bill which can be improved on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in congratulating Deputy Jim Higgins on introducing the Bill. When in Opposition, I introduced a Bill and I know the amount of hard work that goes into preparing it. I congratulate him on his success in that regard.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the Bill, I join with colleagues in expressing sympathy to the Upton family &ndash; Anne and her children &ndash; and the Labour Party. It was a shock to everyone to see the life of a man as young as Pat Upton coming to such an early end. The Minister and I worked well with Pat in debates on justice in the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, explained earlier that the Government is not in a position to support the Bill. He indicated, however, that its introduction has provided a useful opportunity to debate a number of issues to which the Bill gives rise. I reiterate the commitment that the Government will have full regard to the points raised in this debate when it brings forward proposals in this area.</P>
      <P>This is a time of fundamental change in the operation of the courts system. The establishment of the new Courts Service will represent the most fundamental reform of that system since the foundation of the State. The Government is underpinning that structural reform by making the necessary investment in resources. As the House has been informed this evening, a major £11 million investment programme in information technology has been initiated for the court system. This will mean that there is a new context in which we will be able to address the type of issues addressed in the Bill under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I believe that all Members would agree that alternatives to custody should be <Col N="146" /> used to the greatest extent possible, we should acknowledge that alternatives are widely used at present. For example, in 1997, 1,119 offenders were the subject of community service orders and a further 3.498 were subject to probation type supervision.</P>
    <P>The most widely used non-custodial sanction by the courts is, of course, the fine. We have to be careful in considering reforms in relation to the imposition of fines that we do not undermine its existing effectiveness as a sanction. The no doubt unintentional effect of the measures proposed in the Bill could be to do just that. The incentive for people to pay fines on time could be removed. Enormous administrative burdens could be placed on the courts and the Garda and it could involve expenditure that is vastly disproportionate to the amounts of the fines involved. It is no answer to solve the problems caused for the prisons by the need to deal with people who default on fines or debts, just to create a host of problems for other agencies in the criminal justice system. The reality is that no matter what alternatives to imprisonment are introduced for such cases, prison will have to remain as the ultimate sanction in relation to the enforcement of fines or debts.</P>
    <P>The Government believes there is some scope in this regard through the introduction of a carefully targeted attachment of earnings scheme. Work is ongoing on devising legislative proposals to achieve this.</P>

      <P>The issue will be addressed in the context of the establishment of the new Courts Service and the investment programme in new technology to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Even if the provisions of the Bill were practicable, it is simply wrong to suggest that, if implemented, they would have an appreciable effect on the existing availability of prison accommodation. Reference is made to hundreds of people being committed to prison each year for non-payment of fines but, as pointed out to the House already, the reality is that at any given time the number of prison places being taken up by persons committed for non-payment of fines or debts tends to be approximately 1 to 1.5 per cent of the prison population or about 30 places. Many of these places would be in open centres and there is no guarantee that if they were freed there would always be suitable prisoners from closed prisons available to be transferred there. Therefore, whatever the merits of the arguments about the detailed provisions contained in the Bill, the truth of the matter is that they would not have a significant effect on prison accommodation. Instead, they could have a significant effect on undermining the operation of the existing fines system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> That is not the end of the matter in the sense that even though the numbers involved are minuscule as a proportion of prison places, it is right that we should examine what can be done to reduce the number of people being committed to prison for non-payment of debts or fines. The Government is committed to bringing forward practical measures in this regard. Regretfully, we do not regard the measures in the Bill before the House as representing workable solutions in this area. However, I assure Deputy Higgins that in the continuing examination of these issues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform full regard will be had to the proposals which he included in the Bill to see if they could be adapted in a way so that they would not give rise to the type of difficulties outlined.</P>
    <P>I again commend Deputy Higgins for the work he put into producing the Bill and I regret that we are not in a position to commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Jim Higgins. I take this opportunity to sympathise with the Upton family on Pat's tragic death. Dr. Upton was a great debater and possessed a sharp mind. He will be missed by everyone in the House. To his wife and family and to the Labour Party I extend my sympathy.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins on introducing the Bill. Outside farming, this is one issue of which I have been more conscious than most since I was elected to this House. It is ridiculous that people should be transported, at enormous cost to the taxpayer, from Clones, Kerry or wherever to Mountjoy only to discover that there is no place available and that they will have to be transferred to another prison, again at enormous cost to the State, all because they failed to pay a fine which could have been levied from them by instalment.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the imprisonment of debtors and defaulters is not acceptable. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, tried to imply that the proposals put forward in the Bill by Deputy Higgins would be impossible to implement. He stated, &ldquo;We are concerned that what the Bill proposes could undermine the existing system for the payment of fines, could prove vastly and disproportionately expensive to administer, could place impossible administrative burdens on both the courts and the gardaí&rdquo;. That assertion is far removed from reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gardaí are often obliged, at enormous expense in terms of time and effort, to try to track down people who do not pay fines. I wish to give an example of this. I know a young man who was fined £1,700 but he could not afford to pay. He opted to leave the country and travel to England for a period. The young man did not like living there and returned home. Shortly after, he <Col N="148" /> obtained a good job and his sister and I tried to organise a loan to enable him to pay the £1,700 fine. However, because of the pressure put on the local sergeant, the gardaí had to arrest him when they discovered he had returned and rush him to Mountjoy by car on a Friday evening. The good news for him was that, at the prison, he was given £20 to take a taxi back home and he was able to go for a drink in his local pub that night. What benefit to the State is this type of system?</P>
    <P>This is not an isolated example &ndash;  I accept it may have involved one of the larger fines that was not paid &ndash; but is a factual representation of what is happening. If the individual in question had been given adequate time or if he had had an attachment of earnings, the State would have benefited because a prison space would have been freed up and Garda time would not have been wasted. The grounds given by the Minister in refusing to accept the Bill are without foundation. Members of the Garda Síochána have told me they would like to be in a position to accept £100 of a £500 fine for the non-payment of a television licence fee. With modern technology it should be possible for social welfare recipients to have their payments reduced by £5 per week. This is in contrast to the treatment of a former Taoiseach who had a £2 million tax bill written off. We should be realistic. I urge the Minister to accept the Bill.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank all those who participated in the debate. The number who participated on all sides of the House is an indication that there is genuine interest in the issue of prison reform. The Bill does not represent root and branch reform or the antidote to all the problems that beset the prison system, it deals with a small segment which requires to be addressed. It is long overdue. The debate was enlightening and should inform Government policies and legislation on prison reform.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for dealing with the core issues. He identified the costs involved in dealing with fine defaulters and civil debtors in the current fashion. I thank Deputy Ring for his valuable anecdotal examples. About 2,100 persons are picked up by gardaí in uniform and transported by patrol car to Mountjoy Prison and released within a matter of hours. They have, as a result, a track record for what is a non-custodial offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed but not surprised at the Minister's reaction. He has not been open, receptive or magnanimous in the way his predecessor was. I have seldom come across such a list of spurious excuses for refusing a Bill. He said he was concerned that what the Bill proposes could undermine the existing system for the payment of fines, prove vastly and disproportionately expensive to administer, place impossible administrative burdens on the courts and the Garda Síochána <Col N="149" /> and would not make a significant improvement in relation to existing pressure on prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Bill would support the existing system and ensure every fine is collected. It costs £200 to £300 to transport a person to prison. The cost of Garda overtime and the number of hours lost at the local Garda station also have to be taken into account. The Minister said the number of prison places occupied by persons in this category amounts to between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent of the prison population. On any one day this constitutes 40 spaces at an annual cost of £1.8 million or £46,000 per space. We have conservatively estimated the additional costs at £2.5 million. Three gardaí are required to accompany a person transported to prison by taxi or hackney. At a time when our prisons are chock-a-block 40 prison spaces are not an inconsiderable consideration. The Bill would give practical legislative expression to the findings of the Whitaker report on the management of offenders and the recommendations of the crime forum report which were presented in the most trenchant terms possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the probation and welfare service would be overstretched but whose fault is that? The expert report presented last November recommended that 75 officials be appointed immediately. The Minister is awaiting the final report. I hope he had better news when he met representatives of the service today. It costs £2,000 per year to supervise an offender on probation. It costs £46,000 per year to keep him in prison.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for his analysis of the causes of crime, the key to the success of the Labour Party in Britain. He highlighted the need for prevention and to establish a profile of the prison population.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley appears to be labouring under the illusion that crime rates are falling. The number of rapes recorded has increased by 30 per cent and juvenile crime by 15 per cent. The crime figures, however, are not accurate. It is crucial that questions on crime are included in the quarterly household survey to ascertain the true figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said the Bill was ill-conceived and would impose a heavy administrative burden. The facts speak for themselves. The costs are obvious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eoin Ryan said that the Bill was premature. As Deputy Howlin said, it has been on the Order Paper since May 1998. The Government has had every opportunity to introduce its own measure. The Minister and Minister of State failed to indicate a timetable. When will we see the Government's proposals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

        <b>: </b>Deputy Ardagh said it would be unfair to deduct £1 or £5 per week from people on social welfare. It would be much better <Col N="150" /> to do that than throw them in jail which is the only available option.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin, in particular. In a thoughtful contribution he dealt with many of the core issues and shattered a number of myths and shibboleths. The Labour Party has a long track record and is committed to prison reform. The record of Senator Costello speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not concerned with issues that threaten to rock the foundations of the State. The imprisonment of fine defaulters and civil debtors does not make the front pages of the newspapers. As a result of the non-acceptance of the Bill, 40 people will make the long trek to Mountjoy Prison each week. As Deputy Crawford said, some will be home before the gardaí arrive back with the patrol car. Fine defaulters and civil debtors are a silent, powerless and impoverished group whose plight is ignored.</P>
      <P>Other jurisdictions have sought to develop an equitable system for those convicted of non-custodial offences. The neglect of those committed to prison for the non-payment of fines can only be described as disgraceful, second only to the refusal of the Government to accept the Bill. It is blithely accepted that it is the poor who are most likely to feel the bite of sanctions imposed by the courts. Jailing fine defaulters and civil debtors is a burning issue in other jurisdictions. The Bill barely raised a whimper of protest.</P>
      <P>Studies of the prison population confirm that the vast majority of convicted offenders come from disadvantaged areas. What does that say about our society? We are passive about our fellow citizens from these areas being committed to prison for non-custodial offences. I am not optimistic that we will see the Government's measures within its term of office. Order 23, rule 7 of the District Court Rules, 1997, grades the duration of imprisonment according to the amount of unpaid financial penalty. Defaulting on a £50 fine results in a maximum sentence of five days in prison while defaulting on a £500 fine results in a maximum sentence of 90 days in prison.</P>
      <P>We are not conforming to the norms of a civilised society. It is more than six years since the UN Human Rights Committee found Ireland to be in breach of Article 11 of this covenant because it was still possible for citizens to be incarcerated in this jurisdiction for the non-payment of debts. This underlines the need for the cessation of what is by any standards an anachronistic practice of imprisoning debtors.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage I ask for a rethink. If this Bill is accepted by the House tonight it could be law within four weeks. Otherwise, another 2,000 people who have not committed a criminal offence will be incarcerated over the next 12 months. They are costing the State a huge amount in terms of the money spent to produce a most negative result.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Passports for Investment Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this issue on the Adjournment because I tabled two parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach for reply today in relation to files in his Department linked to the passports for investment scheme. The Taoiseach did not reply to those questions and instead transferred them to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The parliamentary questions were as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Taoiseach whether there are files in his Department relating to the passports for investment scheme and whether any such files have been or will be sent to the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>To ask the Taoiseach if he is satisfied that any files relating to the passports for investment scheme that were in his Department between 1988 and 1994 are still available and, if not, their current location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I accept that under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, the Minister with responsibility for naturalisation is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, the Taoiseach is responsible for files in his Department. Furthermore, there is clear evidence that the Taoiseach's predecessor and former leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, had, during the period he was Taoiseach, arranged to ensure that passports for investment cases were brought to him and that he adjudicated on them.</P>
      <P>My objective in raising the issue of the files in the Department of the Taoiseach is to ensure that the facts will be made available and, in particular, that all the information and all the files relating to the scheme are made available to the Moriarty Tribunal. The Taoiseach has referred on a number of occasions to the fact that the files from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are with the tribunal. I emphasise that I am interested in the files which are or were in the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, had a hands-on approach to this scheme. There is evidence that he was involved in handing over some of these passports to those who qualified for citizenship under the scheme. It is also a fact that between 1988 and 1992 a special projects manager was seconded from the IDA to the Department of the Taoiseach to advise the Taoiseach and the Government on development proposals which offered possibilities of increased employment. According to the Government's report, the passports for investment scheme was <Col N="153" /><Col N="154" /> intended to assist the IDA in attracting inward investment, particularly manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The role of the special projects manager was dealt with in the reply to my parliamentary question to the Taoiseach on 3 March 1998. In this reply the Taoiseach stated that Mr. Sean Donnelly and Mr. Colm Regan were seconded from the IDA between 1988 and 1992. While the special projects manager at the Department of the Taoiseach did not have a specific role in the operation of the scheme, &ldquo;they did play a part in certain cases in facilitating contacts&rdquo;. Furthermore, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in a helpful analysis, revealed how the scheme operated in his contribution to the Dáil on 31 May 1994. He had been in Government as a member of Mr. Haughey's Cabinet. He stated that when he joined the coalition Government of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, he was informed by the then Taoiseach of the business investment scheme and how it operated. In particular he stated: </P>
    <P>I complied with the requirements of which I was informed by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, that the people should reside in the country for a substantial period each year and own a residence. The investment had to be substantial and each case was to be brought to his notice so that he might adjudicate on it and pass the matter to the Minister for Justice. As a member of the Government, I understood that the scheme was to be controlled by the Taoiseach to whom I brought parties.</P>
    <P>I raised some of these issues in my contribution in the Dáil last week that were not responded to by the Taoiseach. I also raised the point as to whether the regime put in place by Mr. Haughey was continued by Deputy Reynolds when he took over as Leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach. What is clear is that at least during the time Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach he was fully involved in the operation of the scheme. Accordingly, the evidence available from the files in the Taoiseach's Department, and the officials who were dealing with the scheme in that Department, should be made available to the Moriarty tribunal. I also raised the question of whether these files are in the Department or under its direct control or if they have been sent to the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke in the Dáil recently we learned about meetings with Mr. Gilmartin, that official diaries had been moved to Kinsealy and that a senior official in the current Taoiseach's Department had to make contact there to check the record of these diaries. I want to ask whether any of the files in the Taoiseach's Department relating to the passports for sale scheme similarly went to Kinsealy and whether it is possible that some may still be there. If so, will these be made available to the Moriarty tribunal?</P>
    <P>In relation to these issues I find myself, in many ways, in the same situation as the Progressive Democrats. The Tánaiste said she wants legit<Col N="155" /> imate queries dealt with. That is what I want but so far these issues have not been dealt with. The queries I raised in my contribution last week were not replied to and the follow-up by way of Dáil questions to the Taoiseach resulted in a transfer by the Taoiseach of those questions. That is why I raise these issues on the Adjournment tonight. I now want straight answers to those questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by making it clear that all the files relating to persons naturalised under the investment-based naturalisation scheme between 1988 and 1994 held by my Department have been forwarded to the Moriarty tribunal. In making this point, I also want to make it clear that not alone were the files relating to the period from 1988 to 1994 sent to the tribunal but that in addition to these, the 40 or so files approved when the Deputy's party were in Government have been sent to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The position is that on foot of an order from the Moriarty tribunal all files for the period 1979 to 1996, that is, the period specified in the order, dealing with cases where naturalisation was granted on foot of investments in the State &ndash; the so-called passports for investment scheme &ndash; were made available to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I should also add that my Department has advised the tribunal of certain other naturalisation files which pre-dated the passports for investment scheme and which may be of interest to the tribunal. The Department has indicated to the tribunal that, should the tribunal wish to view these files, it will, on receipt of the necessary production order from the tribunal, make the files available also.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy O'Keeffe, one could be forgiven for thinking that the investment-based naturalisation scheme, which he and his party have stated their support for, was only operated in the period 1988 to 1994. In the circumstances, I would like to jog the Deputy's memory and remind him of a few home truths. I would also like to ask him some questions &ndash; answers to which there seems to be great reluctance to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Deputy O'Keeffe's party leader, Deputy John Bruton, who, as the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, travelled to the Far East in the 1980s seeking investment for the country, first mooted the idea of giving naturalisation for investment. That is a matter of historical fact which is recorded. It is a bit rich then for the Deputy opposite to continue with his mantra that the whole investment-based naturalisation is an invention of my party. That in itself is even harder to take when the Deputy knows full well that his party members when in Government excelled themselves in their prodigious and enthusiastic use of the scheme. Their enthusiasm for the scheme was so much that on their way out the door in June 1997, having been dismissed by the electorate, they felt obliged to reverse their <Col N="156" /> earlier decision to accept no new applications. If that were not enough, they also decided to throw the legal advice they got from their Attorney General back in his face and to direct, by way of Government decision, that four applications, which they had ruled out months beforehand on foot of legal advice, should be processed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has made something of a name for himself as a self-appointed investigator of the operation of this scheme. He has asked many questions as he is entitled to about the scheme. Equally, I have given him full and complete answers and I have published my review of the scheme. This is in complete contrast to the attitude taken to questions about the scheme when his party was in Government. What we got then was prevarication, smokescreens and a review of the scheme which initially was announced in a blaze of publicity in January 1995 and which was then smothered and never heard of again while the Government went on its merry way of utilising the scheme with unbounded and unparalleled enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Curiously, Deputy O'Keeffe seems to confine his forensic questioning skills to the period 1988 to 1994. Why has he not broadened his inquiry to the period 1995 to 1997 and, in particular, why has he not zoned in on the events of June 1997?</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe is taking a leaf out of the book of his leader by adopting the position of not asking the right question, as Deputy Bruton so eloquently put it. If he does not ask the right question, I am prepared to do so. I have yet to hear an explanation as to why this chain of events &ndash; u-turns and ignoring the advice of their own Attorney General &ndash; took place. Perhaps the Deputy opposite would do the House a favour by asking his colleagues the hard questions. I have laid out my stall, I have published the facts and I have ended the scheme, so maybe Deputy O'Keeffe would now tell those of us on this side of the House the answers to these questions. If he cannot, perhaps his party leader, as a practical expression of his newly discovered new patriotism, might tell us.</P>
    <P>With regard to remarks about the Taoiseach's office, I understand a check in the Department of the Taoiseach has not revealed any documents relating to the investment-based naturalisation scheme that one would not expect to be on the files of my Department which have already been sent to the tribunal. Apart from a copy of the file on the case which was the subject of a motion in the House last week, the documents in the Department of the Taoiseach, now that Deputy O'Keeffe brings up the matter, are submissions to Government from Ministers for Justice, related papers and resulting decisions. It goes without saying that all members of the Government and their Departments will co-operate in every way possible with the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>From what I have said Deputy O'Keeffe and others may now appreciate the advice I have given to the Deputy in the past. One should <Col N="157" /> always ensure that one takes one's gun out of the holster before pulling the trigger.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put forward some arguments on the need to ensure that the role of Shannon Airport in balanced regional development is not undermined by Aer Lingus in its quest for strategic partners. The Minister, and those familiar with the issue, are aware that a number of reports were commissioned recently, and others going back over a relatively long period, setting out the importance of Shannon Airport in terms of regional development.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the criteria which the Minister has set for Aer Lingus in its quest for strategic partners but there is considerable speculation that management in the State airline is less than happy about some of the constraints placed on it by some of these criteria. There has been press coverage also which leads one to believe that unhappiness is manifesting itself either from Aer Lingus or some sources close to the Dublin lobby on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been extremely helpful and accessible to Shannon and to myself. Unlike many of her predecessors, she has clearly understood the strategic importance of Shannon in regional terms. I thank the Minister for that and acknowledge the considerable progress made during her relatively short tenure in the Department. Many new services have been developed and it is fair to say that a relatively pessimistic view of the airport's future, which predated her tenure as Minister, has been replaced by a more optimistic one. Nevertheless, all of us have to be aware that changes in Government policy, should they arise, can have a considerable bearing. It is important to record that the changes which occurred in 1993 have had a debilitating effect on the economy of the airport and the region.</P>
      <P>I was interested to read recently a <i>Sunday Business Post </i>editorial to the effect that traffic volumes have grown rapidly at Shannon. Nothing could be further from the truth. One of the reports presented to the Minister sets out the figures from 1993 to 1997 which have not changed dramatically if one includes 1998. The percentage change in Shannon over that period of five years is 6.6 per cent. The percentage change in Dublin is 74 per cent. I welcome the fact that both figures represent growth rather than loss, but the big difference at Shannon is in transit traffic where there has been a 30 per cent drop, while Dublin had a 300 per cent increase on a smaller base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many figures that I know I do not have to put to the Minister because she is aware of them. I have advanced the regional argument more than any other because I believe that Dublin is as big a loser as Shannon or the west when there is an over concentration of access into Dublin and the east. It inevitably brings a dispro<Col N="158" /> portionate growth in tourism and industry, which naturally contributes substantially to the gridlock. Those of us who spend a few days in Dublin each week experience the gridlock for those few days and it makes us sympathetically disposed to those who must live here and experience it every day of the week.</P>
    <P>Improving access to the west can most easily be done by retaining Shannon's present position and building upon it strongly. There is much evidence that is happening but there is counter evidence that Aer Lingus's quest for a strategic partner has both merits and demerits. I welcome the Minister's indication that she will have the matter independently and carefully examined, if that is the case. It is a separate argument and a major one to be examined in terms of the future of the national airline. However, I am not discussing that matter now; I am talking about the possible effects on Shannon. People who have been close to Shannon Airport and who have taken an interest in the issue are very much aware that Aer Lingus's problems in 1993 were the catalyst for negative developments at that time. They are equally conscious that a spin has been put on the story in the media, that Shannon did very well from that change. Shannon has survived that change in very good economic times, but it has also suffered from it. It is well to remember that the change was a great deal smaller than what was intended and what might have happened. It is a long way from an open skies policy and we need to ensure that we remain a long way from such a policy.</P>
    <P>It is fair to admit also that there are infrastructural issues in the mid-west which militate strongly against Shannon. I am glad they are being addressed, including road access. A proposal has been put to the Minister for a light rail link to the airport, which I hope and am confident will receive serious consideration.</P>
    <P>In the context of access for tourism development and industry, nothing in the west of Ireland is more important than Shannon Airport. As an engine for growth in those areas, and as an attempt to spread growth in the regions, nothing is more important for this or any future Government than to ensure that the airport retains the very minimal advantage it has. Everything must be done to build on it, to provide the infrastructure &ndash; which is happening and which we welcome &ndash; and to ensure that people who are charged with developing the airport and those charged with regional policy in the west &ndash; and they are different people at the moment, which is another day's work &ndash; have the advantages which are needed to benefit the west and the capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Killeen for raising this matter. He has persevered with this motion for six days in a row. On one occasion I was not <Col N="159" /> available, then something else happened and last week there was no Adjournment debate. However, the Deputy has kept at it until he got a debate to which I want to contribute. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to speak about the matter.</P>
      <P>In April 1997 my predecessor, Deputy Dukes, mandated the board of Aer Lingus to explore the possibility of entering into a strategic alliance, with or without equity, and to submit proposals to the shareholder. In September 1998 I received a report from the chairman of Aer Lingus in response to that mandate.</P>
      <P>Having examined a number of strategic options, Aer Lingus concluded that the commercial future of the airline could only be secured through participation in a major strategic alliance, of which a strong US partner would be a key component. Arising from the consideration of that report, the Government agreed, in principle, that Aer Lingus should seek a partner, that the partnership could be equity based and that the process could move to the next stage. In other words, they were looking for a bride or groom with cash in their pockets. The process is now at the stage where Aer Lingus is having discussions with a number of prospective partners. The chairman has advised me that this stage will be completed shortly and Aer Lingus will then be in a position to generate proposals for my consideration and that of the Government in April.</P>
      <P>It is much too soon to speculate on the outcome, and on all the issues that may or may not arise. I assure the House that there will be careful and detailed consideration and consultation to ensure the best outcome for the airline, its employees, the taxpayer and for Ireland.</P>
      <P>This week my Department advertised in the EU <i>Official Journal</i> for consultants to assist in that process. Deputy Killeen referred to that in his contribution. When we receive the report from Aer Lingus we will have our own advisers ready who will look at it, discuss it with us and provide us with detailed advice.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Government strongly supports and endorses Shannon Airport's role in achieving balanced regional development for the west of Ireland. This will not be undermined in the quest for a strategic partner for Aer Lingus. That process is intended to secure the future of Aer Lingus, particularly on the North Atlantic, thereby ensuring a strong Aer Lingus transatlantic presence at Shannon into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of a new £40 million terminal, currently underway, which will double the existing capacity, is evidence of the Government's commitment to Shannon, as are the successful efforts in securing additional air services in recent months. I have made it very plain that both I and the Government are open and want to see fresh <Col N="160" /> airline services coming into Shannon. We want to see people and movement there &ndash; all the things that go towards creating an airport. Because we have been so outspoken about it we have had very good results. These include the introduction of year round scheduled services by Continental Airlines from Shannon to Newark, from June last year. In addition, Royal Jordanian Airways commenced an Amman-Shannon-Chicago passenger service on 18 January 1999. That airline also plans to introduce an Amman-Shannon-New York passenger service later this year. Furthermore, Pakistan International Airlines has announced that it will operate a total of six return flights a week routing Karachi-Shannon-New York and Karachi-Shannon-Washington-Toronto, from next month.</P>
    <P>Delta Airlines, which currently operates from Atlanta, will introduce a new New York service in the coming summer, while Aer Lingus will commence a new Los Angeles service also, serving Shannon as well as Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to those new transatlantic services, major developments on the UK and European routes have included the Virgin Express service to London-Stansted, which commenced last December and the new Aer Lingus daily direct Shannon-Paris service, which will commence next month.</P>
    <P>Complementing these new passenger services has been a growth in dedicated cargo services to Shannon, notably by Lufthansa, Cargolux, Martinair and Polarair Cargo.</P>
    <P>I am confident that with the ongoing positive support of Government, allied to that of all interests in the mid-west, Shannon Airport will continue to grow and prosper. I sympathise with many of the points which Deputy Killeen raised. I do not have a constituency interest in Shannon airport, which is a good thing. People from Athlone and elsewhere in Westmeath travel mostly to Dublin Airport &ndash; although some, I am sure, go to Shannon Airport &ndash; to take their flights. It is correct that I should not have any constituency interest in preserving all the transatlantic stopovers at Shannon. However, I have a clear wish, which I share with my Government colleagues, for balanced regional development. That is the best way forward for this country instead of concentrating on one part, welcome though it is.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue in the House. I am sure it is the first of many such debates. I thank Deputy Killeen for his interest and concern. Others have expressed their interest and concern to me about this matter, including the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and Deputy Daly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the <Col N="161" /> Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, is here to reply. I am sure he will, or at least he should, support this important matter. It is disgraceful, unfair and unreasonable that private agricultural and horticultural colleges, such as Rockwell College in my constituency, have not received capital funding for a long time. A submission was made to Government in November 1997 to secure capital and maintenance funds in the budget, but there was no allocation. A further submission was made to secure funding in the 1998 budget, but it has also failed to secure funds. This is an unfair rebuke and a dismissal of those colleges, which provide more than 60 per cent of agricultural education.</P>
      <P>At a time when money is available to invest in education, why is agricultural education being ignored and treated as the Cinderella of the system? The colleges are being continually fobbed off by Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance with each of them claiming this is the responsibility of the other. No section appears to be concerned with the severe plight of private agricultural colleges. They have made facilities and assets, some amounting to almost £50 million, available for the use of the State, but capital investment is required to bring those facilities into line with progressive farming practices and other competitor colleges. I fear some colleges may face closure unless such investment is provided. We cannot and should not train young farmers without modern training facilities. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to take this crisis seriously because the future of agriculture and the survival of our rural communities depends on ensuring our young farmers are properly trained and up to date on farming practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ahearn, for sharing her time with me. I support everything she said about the seven private colleges. They provide 60 per cent of agricultural training, but they have been starved of capital and maintenance grants. They were given £200,000 in 1996 and £100,000 in 1997, but nothing since then. Prior to that, they got grant aid in 1987. It is unfair to ask them to put their resources &ndash; some amounting to £50 million &ndash; at the disposal of their students, while they are not given the level of assistance given to their competitors in the agricultural education sector, the colleges run by Teagasc. The private agricultural colleges compete with those colleges, but they have not been able to secure the capital funds they badly need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer particularly to the Franciscan College in Multyfarnham where there are 38 permanent jobs. That number of jobs in a small village like Multyfarnham is as good as an industry and is extremely important to it. There are 92 students <Col N="162" /> in that college taking first year agricultural courses, first year horticultural courses and second year dairy diploma courses. They need capital grants to upgrade their machinery and technology. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, would be aware that agricultural technology is changing rapidly and unless students are kept updated on the new techniques, facilities and machines coming onstream, those young farmers when they graduate will not be able to compete. It is imperative they are kept updated on modern techniques.</P>
    <P>We should examine the prospect of those colleges expanding to provide rural enterprise training. They could provide not only agricultural training, but, perhaps in conjunction with FÁS, training in other necessary skills and trades. They could expand the training they provide in rural Ireland and thereby help ensure people continue to live there. We should examine the provision by those colleges of such training and ensure they are given the necessary capital grant aid.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I am extremely familiar with Rockwell College. I am an ex-Gormanstown student and I am also familiar with the college in Multyfarnham, which at one time was run by the late Fr. Thaddeus Kelly.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Connaughton on this subject on 18 February last, the position is that Teagasc has responsibility for providing training services in agriculture and horticulture, in accordance with section 4 (1) (a) of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988. In conformity with the statutory position, public funding from the Exchequer and the European Union for agricultural and horticultural training is provided to Teagasc. It is a matter for that body to allocate its financial resources as it determines, subject to the provisions of the legislation. I understand Teagasc allocated maintenance grants of £200,000 and £100,000 to the private colleges in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and recently decided to allocate £90,000 to enable the colleges carry out certain essential works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc made a submission to my Department seeking substantial funding from the Exchequer over five years to meet the capital development needs of all the agricultural and horticultural training facilities, that is, the Teagasc colleges, the private colleges and some local Teagasc training centres. My Department also received a detailed submission from the Agricultural and Horticultural Colleges' Association concerning the funding requirements of the residential colleges over the period 2000 to 2006. These submissions are receiving consideration. In this context, at my request, Teagasc commissioned a study on the likely future demand for training by new entrants <Col N="163" /> and adults in agriculture, horticulture and forestry. This study, which is expected to be completed within a matter of months, will help to provide a basis for making informed decisions on public capital funding of agricultural and horticultural education for the future.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGrath said, agricultural technology is rapidly changing and the allocation of resources in this area will have to be examined to ensure they are distributed in a manner that best meets the interests of those in rural Ireland.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>A ruthless and powerful machine is relentlessly pushing the commercial propagation of genetically engineered crops and vegetables and doing everything to swamp food retail outlets with the resultant genetically modified foods. This machine includes multinational companies like Monsanto whose chemical defoliant, agent orange, laid waste to millions of acres of vegetation during the Vietnam War, the residue of which still causes Vietnamese babies to be born with horrible deformities. Genetically modified food pushers include the top echelons of the US Government. According to the US newspaper <i>The Post Dispatch</i>, during the Taoiseach's visit to the United States last St. Patrick's Day, the Director of the National Security Council, Sandy Berger, was more anxious to lobby the Taoiseach regarding EU clearance for Monsanto's GM corn to enter Europe, than to discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland. The lobby disgracefully includes the New Labour Government in Britain.</P>
      <P>In the US this year tens of millions of acres of genetically engineered corn will be planted. The multinational companies behind this are taking a criminal risk with the world's eco-systems. They release into nature plants with artificially mutated genes whose long-term interaction with the environment is wholly unpredictable. The checks and balances of tens of thousands of years of natural evolution are ruthlessly ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These companies seek to control the world food seed market so they can compel farmers to have exclusive contracts with them for their seeds. In the Third World they are even attempting to develop so-called terminator seeds that would ensure the rice harvest would be infertile and, therefore, would compel all farmers, including the poorest, to buy new seeds every year from the multinationals. They are using genetic engineering to trap farmers in commercial serfdom. These companies are a mortal threat to <Col N="164" /> biodiversity and, therefore, to the security of the world's food supply.</P>
    <P>The swamping of food outlets with genetically modified foodstuffs poses a major potential health hazard to humans. Research carried out by Dr. Arpad Pusztai at the Rowett Institute in Scotland is but the latest in a series of disturbing findings, yet the biotech food industry is flooding supermarkets and shops with products whose health effects could be proven in the future to be disastrous. They are conducting a giant experiment involving hundreds of millions of unwitting human guinea pigs, including five million Irish people.</P>
    <P>A generation of workers were horribly maimed by lethal disease asbestosis before the effects of exposure to asbestos were ascertained. It took a catastrophe in Chernobyl to alert the world to the awful destructiveness of atomic fission, which was used for decades to generate electric power. The BSE crisis was not foreseen. Yet, multinational companies and Governments are ignoring the most basic precautionary principles and are pushing ahead with genetic engineering projects involving food, which in both environmental and human health terms, may well in the future put asbestosis, Chernobyl and BSE in the shade. It is alarming that most of the research into and testing of these products are conducted by the very companies who stand to gain massively.</P>
    <P>This Government has gutlessly allowed genetically modified food products to be widely dispersed in retail outlets. Labelling, where it exists is pathetically inadequate; one would need a magnifying glass to read the labels. Hundreds of foodstuffs in our shops are genetically engineered. This is shameful gambling with the health of our people.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people should take heed of the warning from many concerned organisations and individuals. They should not buy genetically modified foodstuffs; they should boycott them and ask supermarkets not to sell them. The Socialist Party will make this a major issue in the coming European and local elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time. The greatest threat to good science is when it sells out to commercial interests. Gene technology is not driven by some altruistic view of the world but by the desire for greater profits. This results in a combination of bad science and big business rushing an untried and inadequately researched technology prematurely on to the market. It brings unprecedented risks to health, the environment and bio-diversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public has every right to be sceptical about a company like Monsanto, which gave us dioxins, PCBs and agent orange and now apparently wants to feed the world. Instead, it has force fed a bland reassurance and our Government has apparently bought all its lies. It has ignored the <Col N="165" /> genuine concerns of ordinary people. The Minister has reneged on his pre-election promise and embarked on what he calls a consultative process. This is simply a stalling exercise.</P>
    <P>I applaud the work of VOICE, Greenpeace and the other NGOs who have asked for a debate on this. They have rejected the Minister's consultative process. We want a proper debate in this House and an external debate. That is the only way this issue will come to the fore. Proposals for labelling and segregation must be discussed in detail; we want proper labelling and segregation. Above all, we want a moratorium. It is only when we have that that we will be able to discuss these issues properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I am aware of the recent concerns and media reports concerning the issue of genetically modified food. This is a very complex issue involving,<i> inter alia</i>, technical, scientific, ethical and economic aspects. Within the scientific aspect, there are ecological, environmental, nutritional, human health and veterinary concerns. Because of the recent emergence of this technology, we must approach the issues which it raises in a thorough, comprehensive and balanced manner.</P>
      <P>The technology has the potential to be of great benefit to humanity. However, its potential benefits must be weighed against any potential risks. Because of the wide range of issues to be considered in relation to genetic modifications several Government Departments have responsibility for different aspects of it, including responsibility for different EU legislative instruments. My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for developments in the biotechnology industry while the Minister for Agriculture and Food has responsibility for EU legislation on seed varieties. I understand this legislation is in the process of being amended to take account of developments in gene technology.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has responsibility for Directive 90/219 on the contained use of genetically modified organisms as well as Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This directive covers the environmental risk assessment and release approval of all GMOs through both the research and development stage, known as field trials, as well as the placing of products containing GMOs on the market. The Environmental Protection Agency enforces this directive on behalf of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is the competent authority in Ireland for EU legislation pertaining to the genetic modification of foodstuffs intended for human consumption. There are two EU regu<Col N="166" /> lations in this regard. Regulation No. 258/97 came into force in all member states on 15 May 1997. This regulation applies to the placing of novel foods and novel food ingredients on the market in the European Community. Food and food ingredients which have not, as of 15 May 1997, been used to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia</i>, within its scope. In essence, the regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must be officially approved and authorised before being placed on the European market. The regulation also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients.</P>
    <P>The controls as outlined provide protection to consumers and I wish to assure the house that I am keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case. To assist my Department in this area, the newly established Food Safety Authority's scientific committee has set up a GMO and novel foods sub-committee which advises my Department on issues in the area of genetic modification. This sub-committee also affords a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. This sub-committee assesses applications made under Regulation 258/97.</P>
    <P>To date, no application to place a novel food on the market has been made to my Department, being the Irish competent authority for this regulation. However, the GMO and novel foods sub-committee has commented on a number of applications which have been made to other member states. To date, no product has received approval in Europe under this regulation. However, a genetically modified soya bean manufactured by Monsanto and a genetically modified maize manufactured by Novartis, formerly Ciba Geigy, were authorised under Directive 90/220 prior to the coming into force of Regulation 258/97.</P>
    <P>To address consumer concerns, the council published Regulation No. 1139/98 concerning the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms. This regulation came into effect on 1 September 1998 and ensures that the provisions of Regulation 258/97 apply to foods and food ingredients consisting of or derived from GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation 258/97. The aim of this regulation is to ensure that the same labelling rules, for the information of the final consumer, apply to food and food ingredients consisting of or derived from GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation 258/97. In essence, if genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the <Col N="167" /> additional labelling requirements laid down in the regulation.</P>
    <P>Last August, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published a consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment.</P>

Arising from this, the independent chairperson will submit a report to the Minister and having considered this, he will arrive at a national position. I await the outcome of this consultation with interest.</P>

In the first edition, which has been circulated to all Deputies, I also stressed the need for a much deeper partnership between employers and their workforces, particularly at enterprise level. With greater competition and the ever increasing rate of change in the modern world, an agreed union-management framework within which to respond to these issues in a non-adversarial manner is essential.</P>

The bulletin highlights the specific initiatives that are now under way.</P>

      <P>There are six bodies reporting to my Department. They are the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Centre for Partnership, the Information Society Commission, the National Statistics Board and the National Millennium Committee.</P>
      <P>Details of the work of these bodies and, where relevant, their reports, are laid out in the schedule which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my recent answers to previous parliamentary questions in <Col N="170" /> these matters, particularly Questions Nos. 1 and 2 of 10 February 1999 and Question No. 64 of 24 November 1998.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE</P>
    <P>
      <i>NESC (National Economic and Social Council)</i>, appointed in November 1998, has been meeting on a monthly basis since then. At the request of the Government, the main work of the council during 1999 will relate to the preparation of a new strategy report to provide a basis for a national agreement in succession to Partnership 2000. Also, the NESC secretariat is working on a study benchmarking Irish progress in the areas covered by the Partnership 2000 agreement both over time and by comparison with other countries. The subject matter includes work on education, taxation and childcare. Some of the material in the benchmarking exercise will be drawn upon for the strategic review. It is intended that the results of the research will be published later in 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>NESF (National Economic and Social Forum)</i> was established by the Government in 1993 as an advisory body to contribute to the formation of a wider national consensus on economic and social policy, particularly to combat social exclusion. Its mandate was renewed in 1995 and in 1997. The newly constituted NESF will focus on the detailed monitoring of initiatives taken in the context of social partnership, especially with regard to social exclusion and long-term unemployment. The newly constituted forum held its inaugural meeting on 12 November 1998.</P>
    <P>Reports published in the last 12 months: In November and December 1997, prior to its mandate being renewed, the forum produced two reports and two opinions as follows:&ndash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reports</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Second Periodic Report on the Work of the Forum &ndash; November 1997 A Framework for Partnership &ndash; Enriching Strategic Consensus Through Participation &ndash; November 1997</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opinions</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Development of the Equality Provisions &ndash;  November 1997 Targeted Employment and Training Measures &ndash;  November 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Information Society Commission</i> reports to the Taoiseach. The commission is an advisory body whose main function is to monitor and advise Government on the development of an Information Society in Ireland. One of the most important of the commission's tasks is to raise awareness amongst the general public and industry of the opportunities and benefits offered by the Information Society. The commission has established six advisory groups to assist it in its work. These groups cover awareness, infrastructure, learning, enterprise, legal issues and Government services and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Centre for Partnership</i> is actively pursuing a work programme to achieve its role, as described in Partnership 2000, of promoting the partnership approach in both the public and private sectors. This involves the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. The recently published magazine of the Centre, Partnership at Work, sets out the specific initiatives under way. The Centre is not required to produce regular reports.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Millennium Committee </i>reports to the Government. It was established to advise on proposed projects of national significance for inclusion in the Government's millennium programme and also on a scheme for supporting projects at a local level, including in areas of social disadvantage. The committee meets on a monthly basis. The chairman of the committee, Deputy Seamus Brennan, Chief Whip, recently made a progress report on the work of the committee to the Government and intends submitting further reports on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Statistics Board</i> operates on the basis of five-year strategic plans. The most recent plan, Strategy for Statistics, 1998-2002 was published in September 1998. The board meets <Col N="171" /> regularly to assess progress. Each year, the board reports on the progress made by the CSO in implementing the board's strategic plan. Currently, the board is drafting its 1998 annual report. While a specific deadline has not been set for its finalisation, it is expected to be presented to Government and published by July 1999.</P>

      <P>I dealt comprehensively in this House last week with all of the issues arising from my interview with the <i>Sunday Times</i> the weekend before last. I do not believe it would be the best use of Dáil time to run over the same ground again this week.</P>
      <P>We are all extremely grateful for the engagement and support of the United States Administration throughout this process, including, of course, the key role played by Senator George Mitchell as talks chairman. President Clinton has made it clear that he himself remains available to help in any way he can, as opportunities offer. We are grateful for that assurance and we shall be alert to every opening for constructive involvement by the President of the United States, not least in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, it is vital that the two Governments and all of the parties to the agreement continue to work intensively to get over the current difficulties. As I have said previously, I believe that, if we all put our hearts and minds to it, we can make the necessary progress in the period immediately ahead.</P>
      <P>The programme for my visit to the United States for the St. Patrick's Day period is being finalised. At present there are no plans in the programme for a formal meeting with Senator Mitchell but it is quite possible that, if he is in Washington, I shall have the pleasure of meeting the senator, who put so much time and effort into bringing about a peaceful accommodation in this island and to whom all of us owe so much.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to supplementary questions from Deputy Quinn on 9 February last, the Office of the Attorney General will be considering the publication of pre-1922 legislation on CD-ROM over the coming months. Whether relevant pre-1922 statutes should be published alone, or as part of a fully revised Statute Book is one of the issues to be considered. The recent appointment of the director of the statute law revision and consolidation unit in the Office of the Attorney General will assist this process.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 of the CD-ROM project, to be released in June, will include the chronological tables of the statutes 1922 to 1998. For each Act passed since 1922, these tables will give precise details of how the Act has been amended or repealed over time. This is the first step in the process to produce a revised Statute Book.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view of the success of the Statute Book on CD-ROM, and that the addition of pre-1922 material to the CD-ROM would add significant value to the product.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether many farmers and their families are now suffering very serious hardship and a large number of them are living well below the poverty line; and the steps, if any, he proposes to deal with the crisis.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, published in 1997, estimated that in 1994, farm households accounted for 9 per cent of total households in poverty. In a further analysis of those at risk of poverty NAPS estimated that 20 per cent of farm households were at risk of being in poverty, compared to an 18 per cent risk for all households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the latest CSO estimate, aggregate farm income in 1998 fell by 5 per cent to £1,855 million. This aggregate figure masks a much more serious impact on incomes for some sectors of agriculture. The disappointing performance in 1998 was mainly due to poor weather, and <Col N="177" /> the collapse of the Russian market in the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>As the weather and market difficulties developed during 1998, a range of actions were taken, including: direct payments to farmers were speeded up and special advances provided these payments reached a record level of £1,038 million, over 10 per cent up on the 1997 level, and now account for 56 per cent of farm income; changes in EU market support arrangements have been negotiated; and a fodder package, costing £21 million, was introduced before Christmas to help those worst affected by the weather.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I announced a further £20 million in fodder aid for farmers on top of the £21 million paid out before Christmas on fodder related schemes, bringing the total Government contribution to £41 million. The scheme will benefit over 85,000 farmers in disadvantaged areas, and in addition a special hardship fund will be available to help other farmers in severe difficulty, subject to strict qualification criteria.</P>
    <P>A revamped farm assist scheme has also been introduced, costing £43 million in a full year, to support low income farmers. In response to the difficulties now being experienced, it has been decided to bring forward the implementation of this scheme to April. In order to allow for the necessary preparatory work, including means testing, the first payments will issue in the first week in June. The scheme will benefit in the region of 13,400 farm families, including the 6,600 already participating in the existing scheme. I regard the farm assist scheme as a very important innovation and a clear expression of this Governments commitment to practical action on rural poverty.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all possible steps are being taken to alleviate the problems currently faced by farming families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report that continued progress is being made on the implementation of the national beef assurance scheme, including the animal traceability elements. Phase one of the computerised cattle movement monitoring system, which was introduced on 28 September last, is operating well. Farmers and dealers are notifying private sales of cattle and the number of marts recording the movement of animals through their premises has now doubled. It is expected that all marts will be in a position to record and transmit details of animal movements shortly. Arrangements to extend the system to meat plants are being finalised at present. The <Col N="178" /> system has already been piloted successfully in five plants and roll-out to the general body of plants is expected to commence early next month. Progress is also being made in relation to the extension of the system to live export points and to other operators.</P>
      <P>The Government authorised the drafting of a Bill to put the national beef assurance scheme on a statutory footing on 17 November last. Drafting has commenced and my Department is working closely with the parliamentary draftsman's office on this matter. The Bill will, in particular, underpin the wider elements of the scheme, including the standards to be applied by farms, meat plants, marts and other parties involved in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 61 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The bovine tuberculosis level tends to be cyclical and the 1997 level was the lowest recorded for many years. Unfortunately, the rate of disclosure of TB reactors was higher in 1998 than in recent years. A detailed review of the reasons for the increased level is being undertaken and the results will be discussed with the farming bodies-veterinary groups on a scientific sub-group of the Animal Health Forum shortly. Any proposals for additional measures will be considered by the full Animal Health Forum at an early date.</P>
      <P>Research projects including the specialised work of the TB investigation unit are continuing with the aim of providing new technologies required to eradicate TB. The research is focused in particular on the role of the badger as well as establishing the best possible information on the causes of the disease spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of brucellosis has also been a matter for concern. In relation to the current situation and in consultation with the Animal Health Forum a number of new measures have been introduced to combat the disease which are as follows: from 23 February 1998 all female cattle and <Col N="179" /> bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; from the same date, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test and such cattle being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken directly to either the purchaser's holding or directly to a mart and from there directly to the purchaser's holding; blood testing for all eligible cattle to augment and complement existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing; revamped administrative procedures in my Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with burcellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds; arrangements to <Col N="180" /> speed up the completion of blood tests and the improved notification of results; early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities; an awareness/advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis; and a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>
    <P>The arrangements being applied for both TB and brucellosis for 1999 will be kept under review in consultation with the Animal Health Forum.</P>
    <P>The number of herds affected by TB and brucellosis at 31 December 1997 and 31 December 1998 and the number of reactors, and depopulations by DVO in 1998 are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The objective of measure 5 of the REPS and agri-environmental specifications is the management of hedgerows on a phased basis to encourage their development with a diversity of height, stages of growth and form in the interests of wildlife, stock control and scenic appearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that complaints have been made in relation to the use of mechanical diggers in the implementation of the requirements of measure <Col N="181" /> 5. However, where damage has been caused by non-adherence to the specifications suitable penalties are imposed by my Department under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to make the specifications more explicit in this respect, measure 5 has been reviewed and significant changes have been made in relation to hedgerow maintenance. Under these farmers will be encouraged to retain quality hedgerows and to confine maintenance to essential practices such as stockproofing, inplanting with suitable species and the control of invasive species. The use of mechanical diggers and machinery of a similar type in the maintenance of hedgerows will in future be prohibited. I shall be issuing the revised specifications shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, pending the issue of the revised specifications, my Department recently issued a circular to all approved REPS planners advising them of the revision to measure 5 of the REPS scheme and, that pending the distribution of the revised specifications, requesting them to bear in mind that quality mature hedgerows should be retained in their entirety with maintenance confined to inplantings, the control of invasive species and stockproofing when preparing or reviewing REPS plan.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these new specifications will address the concerns which have been voiced in regard to the implementation of the measure.</P>

      <P>Agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation last July providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government through the General Peoples Committee formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
      <P>Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle. These delays are of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities, through every possible channel, with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice. Our position is that an official agreement has been reached with the Libyan authorities and that it should be honoured.</P>
      <P>As regards Iran, I am pleased to say that a veterinary protocol was signed in Dublin on 29 October 1998 setting out detailed arrangements for the immediate resumption of the export of beef to Iran. The successful conclusion of this protocol followed a week long visit here by a veterinary delegation from Iran and the decision in principle by Iran to re-open its market to Irish beef which I had negotiated in Tehran two weeks previously. Since then the Minister for Foreign Affairs co-chaired the third session of the Ireland/Iran Joint Economic Commission in Tehran in late January and the veterinary protocol was embodied in the agreed memorandum of understanding. Assurances were also given that Irish beef will be considered when contracts, to fulfil Iranian requirements in its next fiscal year, commencing in late March, are negotiated. The conclusion of beef contracts is now a matter for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 50, 55, 63, 75, 120 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I am in Brussels this week, attending the crucial meeting of the Council of Ministers which is seeking to reach agreement on the CAP reform aspects of the Agenda 2000 proposals.</P>
      <P>From the outset of these negotiations, I have made it very clear at meetings of the Council of Ministers that the proposals as presented by the Commission would seriously damage Irish agriculture and the economy. I have indicated in the strongest possible manner my opposition to the proposals and my concerns about the effect they would have on Irish farmers incomes. I have also emphasised my concerns about the lack of equity between member states and between different types of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also taken every opportunity to put Ireland's case in a series of bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and with ministerial <Col N="184" /> colleagues in other member states which began last year. Recently I met Commissioner Fischler in Dublin on 4 February and had bilateral discussions with the Commissioner and the President of the Council, Herr Funke, the German Minister for Agriculture, in Brussels on 16 February. Intensive bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and with ministerial colleagues are continuing this week. A series of bilateral meetings is also continuing at official level.</P>
    <P>I have been mindful of the need to consult as widely as possible domestically about the implications of the CAP reform proposals. That is why I set up four consultative groups, for beef, milk, arable crops and rural development, early last year to which farmers, processors, academics and other interested persons were appointed. The agricultural aspects of Agenda 2000 have also been discussed with all the social partners at Partnership 2000 plenary sessions in April 1998 and January 1999. I am also, of course, conscious of the value of direct consultations with the farm organisations and, most recently, I met the four farm organisations last Wednesday in preparation for this week's Council meeting.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that I am very conscious at all times of the need to protect family farms. One of the key priorities for this Government, as indicated in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the strategy statement of the Department of Agriculture and Food, is the retention of the highest practicable number of farm households. The Common Agricultural Policy has a multiplicity of objectives and roles but it attaches particular importance to family farming as well as to the environment, food quality and safety and animal welfare. The European model of agriculture has, in general, provided a suitable framework for the development of Irish agriculture and it is my intention to ensure that this model is respected in the current negotiations and defended by the EU in the next round of trade negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Commission's proposals, or the outcome of the negotiations on them, would lead to American ranch-scale or factory farming.</P>
    <P>Some measures under discussion could be regarded as movements towards re-nationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy, or of having such an effect.</P>
    <P>These are the proposals for the creation of national envelopes in the beef and milk sectors and the option of co-financing of expenditure on direct payments to farmers which was discussed in the Commission's report on the own resources system published last October. I am opposed in principle to both of those proposals and have expressed that opposition on every appropriate occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The disposal of animal carcases has implications for animal health, public health and the environment and is thus regulated by a range of legislation in these areas. The responsibility for the disposal of animals which die on farms is primarily a matter for the herdowner in question.</P>
      <P>Knackeries, which provide a carcase collection service from farms are licensed in accordance with the European Communities (Knackery) Regulations 1996. The service is provided on a commercial basis and the manner in which the collected animal is disposed of is strictly regulated. Arising out of BSE related controls introduced in 1997, the specified risk material element of collected carcases must be removed and sent for destruction to the designated SRM processing plant. The charge to knackeries for disposal of this material is set at a level which is substantially below the commercial cost involved.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to subsidise the service provided by knackeries in relation to the collection of fallen animals. I have, as the Deputy is aware, chosen to address the fodder difficulties being experienced by farmers this year by means of two schemes involving a total allocation of £41 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the <Col N="186" /><i>mv Philomena Purcell</i>, which had been moored at Waterford for inspection purposes. This vessel was inspected at Waterford on 17 February 1999 and has been approved, subject to certain conditions to carry live cattle to the Continent and the Middle East. Excluding roll-on, roll-off facilities, this brings to 15 the number of vessels approved by my Department to carry cattle from Ireland. All of these vessels can carry cattle to Continental Europe, while 11 of them are also approved to carry cattle to the Middle East.</P>
      <P>As far as the live trade with continental Europe is concerned the number of cattle exported in 1998, at 141,940, was the highest in recent years and over six times the number exported to Europe in 1997. Many of these cattle travelled on vessels approved by my Department in the course of 1998.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity to indicate that the current requirements governing the approval of ships for the carriage of cattle from Ireland were put in place in 1996 against the background of major losses on three vessels carrying cattle from this country. These requirements are designed to ensure that only suitable vessels of an acceptable standard are used to carry cattle from Ireland.</P>
      <P>The live trade is of vital importance to Irish agriculture and the Irish economy and, more than virtually all other countries, we cannot afford to take risks with it. I am therefore committed to properly applying the legislation governing the carriage of cattle by sea in a way that is fully consistent with facilitating cattle exports on suitable vessels which meet reasonable welfare requirements. Allowing Irish cattle to be shipped on vessels which do not meet stipulated requirements is simply a gamble not only with the welfare of the animals on board but with the future of the live export trade and the livelihood of thousands of Irish livestock farmers. My Department will continue, as it has done to date, to support the live trade by approving vessels which are of the required standard.</P>

      <P>Turnover in the food retail sector increased from £4.29 billion in 1992 to £5.12 billion in 1997. The most noticeable trend has been one of concentration. The number of supermarket outlets increased from 155 in 1992 to 180 in 1997 while the number of independent grocers declined by some 1,000. In the same period, there has been a rapid expansion in forecourt retailing with the number of relevant outlets increasing by some 400.</P>
      <P>The current development strategy for the food industry &ndash; the food sub-programme &ndash; recognises the important role of the retail and food service sectors. While its measures do not provide direct support to those sectors, they are designed to ensure that the food industry has the necessary capabilities to meet their and the consumer's requirements. The future action plan proposed by the food industry development group retains a market-oriented focus. The group included representation from the retail sector and took account of likely developments in the retail and food service areas when formulating its proposals. The group's report will be borne in mind in the context of the new national development plan and the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>In its marketing and promotion of Irish food, An Bord Bia continues to work closely with the retail and food service sectors. The activities undertaken include food fairs, regional food festivals, seminars for chefs, ongoing advisory programmes, and media campaigns.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being encountered by cattle farmers in relation to the loss of single or both ear tags and the impact this is having on producers in relation to the timing of premium payments and the delays in getting cattle slaughtered.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5212/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Community and national legislation, cattle born since 1996 must be identified, <i>inter alia</i>, by means of two plastic eartags, each containing the same unique tag number. An animal bearing only one plastic eartag is not properly identified and must not be moved from a holding. In a small number of cases cattle are presented for slaughter at meat plants-abbatoirs with a single eartag. Exceptionally, and to deal with such cases, my Department has recently introduced arrangements to allow such animals to be considered for slaughter provided not more than a percentage of the animals in the consignment are missing one eartag and that the animals in question comply with the other EU <Col N="189" /> identification requirements that is; (i) that they have a valid passport document; (ii) that they are recorded on the national registration database and (iii) that they are correctly recorded in the herdowners on-farm herd register. I should mention that experience has shown that where animals are correctly and securely tagged in accordance with instructions, tag loss in transit is low.</P>
      <P>The position regarding headage-premium payments is that where one tag is missing at inspection payment is allowed and the farmer is advised to get a replacement tag immediately. Where both tags are missing, the other elements of identification and registration are considered to establish if the applicant has maintained traceability as far as possible. If it is established that the applicant is complying fully with the other elements of identification and registration then the untagged animal is deleted from the claim without reduction penalties on the other animals. All animals applied on are counted for stocking density.</P>
      <P>Where it is established that there is non-compliance with any other aspect of the identification and registration requirements then the animal in question is rejected from the claim with consequent reduction penalties on all the other animals on the claim.</P>
      <P>The issue of tagging should not normally affect the timing of premium payments. Processed claims are cleared for payment and payment commences at the earliest permissible by the regulations governing the schemes. Payment may not issue where outstanding queries are unresolved or where an appeal has been lodged.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the correct identification of cattle is an essential requirement for traceability purposes. It is most important therefore that all aspects of the tagging arrangements are fully complied with at all times in order to provide the assurances demanded by consumers and customers abroad.</P>

      <P>Area aid applications were received from over 132,500 farmers in 1998. All of these applications have been processed. Some 98 per cent have been cleared resulting in payments of some £590 million across a range of 1998 arable and livestock schemes.</P>
      <P>The balance of some 3,000 applicants who have not yet received any payment have been contacted by my Department with a view to resolving outstanding problems with their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the course of the 1998 processing year, the area aid unit contacted in excess of 90,000 herdowners because of difficulties with their <Col N="190" /> applications. The main problems encountered were overclaims, duplicate claims, missing maps and incomplete applications.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge farmers who have not yet responded to the queries raised with them by my Department to do so at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would urge the 12,000 forage applicants, who have been paid on reduced areas, to respond quickly to letters issued by the area aid unit with accompanying maps since the beginning of the year. Failure to resolve these problems will mean that in many cases no extensification payments can be made.</P>

      <P>The EU ban on hormones for growth promotion purposes in animals has been in place for over a decade. Ireland has consistently enforced the ban with vigour, as evidenced in particular by a series of prosecutions in the courts, in order to ensure that consumers both on home and export markets can have confidence in the safety of Irish food products.</P>
      <P>The EU ban, in so far only as it relates to imports into the Union of hormone treated third country beef was challenged by the US and certain other third countries under WTO procedures. The WTO panel findings, as amended by the WTO appellate body, while accepting the right, in principle, of the EU to take such public health protection measures, nonetheless found that the EU ban was not fully in conformity with current WTO rules. The European Commission, which has committed the EU to fully respecting its obligations under the WTO, sought a reasonable time period within which to do this. In particular, it has sought time for the completion of a number of scientific studies concerning hormone specific and residue specific risk assessment for all six hormones in question.</P>
      <P>I understand that while interim results of some of the studies may be available in advance of the May 13 next deadline set by the WTO, final results will not be to hand by that time. The European Commission is currently considering a number of possible options which take account of the EU interest in this matter and which would be designed to avert the trade dispute threatened by the US side.

      <P>The legislation governing the importation of dogs and cats provides for free movement of these animals from the United Kingdom, <Col N="194" /> the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as they share our health status with regard to rabies, while animals from all other countries must undergo a period of six months quarantine in a premises approved by my Department. These requirements are designed to eliminate the risk of rabies being brought into the State by animals incubating the disease. Quarantine is usually in the approved public quarantine premises.</P>
      <P>The importation of dogs and cats is governed by a licensing system and a strict surveillance regime is in place at all ports and other points of entry.</P>
      <P>The future requirements relating to imports of dogs and cats are under consideration following the publication of the report in September 1998 of the Advisory Group on Quarantine established by the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Kennedy report). This report recommends that the quarantine system in place should be replaced with a system involving vaccination, blood-testing and microchip identification requirements for dogs and cats travelling between Great Britain and the member states of the European Union, the European Economic Area or rabies-free islands. The report also states that a further period of up to three years would be required to enable the necessary arrangements to give effect to the recommendations to be put in place.</P>
      <P>I am following these developments closely and have initiated an examination of Ireland's quarantine system, as changes which might be contemplated in the UK system of quarantine controls would hold potential for Ireland given the common approach to rabies which both countries have followed over many years.</P>

      <P>I am acutely aware of the need for good quality planning for the future of the agri-food sector. This sector is of enormous importance to the economy as a whole. Primary agriculture is more important to Ireland than to all other member states except Greece, and its contribution to GDP is twice the EU average. The agri-food sector as a whole (agriculture, food, drinks and tobacco) accounts for 13 per cent of GDP, and 12 per cent of employment and exports. Preserving the stability and growth of this sector is absolutely necessary for the well-being of our overall economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year a food industry development group was established and its report was published earl<Col N="195" /> ier this month. The report examined the food industry's recent performance and looked at factors which would influence its future environment. It also analysed the various opportunities and challenges for the various sectors within the industry. The report identified attention to competitiveness and market orientation as key factors for future progress. It sets out the issues that need to be addressed to enhance capabilities in these areas. It recommends specific targets and foresees particularly strong growth in the prepared foods, drinks and food ingredients sectors. The report provided a very clear and precise blueprint for future development, and will certainly receive due consideration in the context of the new national development plan and the next round of structural funds.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently preparing a White Paper on Rural Development which will deal with rural development as a multi-dimensional integrated process. The intention is that this paper will address rural development as a broad multifunctional process involving economic, social, cultural and environmental conditions which influence the quality of life of rural communities. The preparation of the paper has been marked with extensive consultation through the interdepartmental committee, country wide seminars, and written submissions from interested bodies and individuals.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government decided to establish an expert group on agriculture to look at the future of the sector. The group will be established once the Agenda 2000 decisions are made. It will also take on board the conclusions of the White Paper on Rural Development, which will be published in the next few months.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these initiatives will ensure that coherent plans will be put in place to guide the development of the agriculture and food sectors as they face the challenges of the future.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to Question No. 68 of 16 December 1998, an EU Commission inspection mission to Ireland in March 1998 found certain hygiene related deficiencies concerning the loading bay, handling of seized-detained carcases and the staining of specified risk material at the plant in question. In addition, deficiencies were found which, in the opinion of the EU inspectors, could allow for the possibility of fraud. However, it was made clear by the EU Commission, at a later meeting in Brussels, that <Col N="196" /> the inspection mission had not found any evidence of actual or attempted fraud.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the findings of the mission and its own ongoing review of in-plant veterinary procedures, my Department took a number of steps to further improve controls at all meat plants. These included revised arrangements in relation to marshalling halls and loading bays in all slaughter plants, including the plant to which the Deputy refers; revised procedures for the detention of carcases in all slaughter plants; tightened procedures for the identification, handling, segregation, staining and removal of specified risk material in all slaughter and cutting plants; and revision of the procedures at local plant level in respect of the evaluation of cattle age for the purpose of facilitating commercial trade.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has been fully apprised of the actions taken by my Department following the inspection.</P>

      <P>The beef intervention insurance contract entered into with the brokerage concerned in 1990 was on foot of an open, competitive tendering procedure in which a total of seven firms participated. The contract had been publicly advertised on 26 March 1990 and in advance of that, some 19 insurance firms had been invited to tender for the business. The successful tenderer held the contract from 1 June 1990 to 31 May 1993.</P>
      <P>The value of the premia paid to the broker for each year of the contract period is detailed hereunder. Variations in the amounts payable reflect the varying levels of intervention beef and/or adjustments to the representative green pound rates applicable.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the great difficulty landowners have trying to distinguish their plots of land for area aid on photocopied aerial maps being sent to landowners by his Department due to the fact that the original maps sent by the landowners were mislaid by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998 the area aid unit of my Department processed in excess of 132,500 new applications after having cleared a backlog of almost 20,000 cases from 1997. The volume of maps processed by the unit was very high in 1998, with up to 200,000 maps being issued to some 85,000 farmer applicants. In regard to the maps issued to farmers, these are all printed from the area aid units graphic database. This database was created from Ordnance Survey maps supplied by farmers and validated against ortho photographs derived from an aerial survey of the country carried out in 1995. The advantage to farmers of issuing ortho photograph maps is that these identify up to date land boundaries whereas, in many cases, Ordnance Survey maps are significantly out of date.</P>
      <P>Initially, maps were issued to all farmers who had submitted claims in 1997 which had required map alterations such as boundary changes, the addition or removal of parcels or other digitising amendments. This was a task of considerable proportions involving the issuing of 139,827 maps to 58,731 herdowners. These maps outlined the farmers digitised land parcels and the unique numbers assigned to those parcels. The gross area of each land parcel was also contained on the map collar.</P>
      <P>Additionally, as errors in the 1998 applications were identified during processing, it was necessary to issue more maps. These were issued to farmers on an ongoing basis throughout the year for the purpose of resolving individual cases. In this way applicants with problems were afforded every opportunity to correct boundaries which they had inaccurately drawn and to resolve entitlements where the issue of duplicate and overlapping claims had arisen.</P>
      <P>This involved the issue of an additional 60,000 maps to some 25,000 herdowners. Indeed, some 3,000 of these cases still remain to be resolved and no payments can issue until the people concerned respond to queries from the area aid unit.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the large volume of maps issued, and taking into account that 98 per cent of all area aid applications have been cleared and paid, it is evident that the details contained on the maps issued did not present any serious difficulty to the vast majority of area aid applicants.</P>

      <P>Towards the end of 1998, I met a number of multiples to discuss the growing concern among consumers at the perceived failure of the retail trade to reduce the price of meat on the shelves to reflect the historically low prices paid to farmers.</P>
      <P>I made it clear to the multiples that the Government is particularly concerned about consumer perceptions of unnecessarily high meat prices on supermarket shelves. Profiteering at any point in the supply chain, either at retail level or at the processing stage, would be wholly unacceptable to me as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs. I also made it clear that the multiples must move quickly to restore consumer confidence in the value they are getting for meat and demonstrate clearly that they are pushing prices down.</P>
      <P>The multiples maintained, in general, that any reductions in the prices which they pay to processors have been reflected in their retail prices and the most recent CSO data would indicate that some of the reductions in farm producer prices have been passed on to consumers. I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
      <P>As regards price control generally, it is Government policy to encourage competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers. I have drawn the attention of the director of competition enforcement to a debate in this House on the issue of food prices &ndash; 7 October, 1998 &ndash; and I have asked him to take such action as he considers appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, visited Honduras on 12 and 13 January and saw at first hand the damage caused by hurricane Mitch. Despite a remarkable clean-up effort by the Hondurans themselves, the extent of the damage, particularly to infrastructure, is still readily visible, including in and around the capital.</P>
      <P>A major preoccupation for the Honduran Government is the rehabilitation of the productive sectors of the economy and employment creation. The Honduran economy is heavily reliant on the agricultural sector, and damage to the banana and coffee plantations was extensive. The Government of Honduras has appealed to the international community for assistance in the reconstruction effort. In this regard, the Minister announced the provision of an additional £200,000 in grants towards the emergency effort, bringing the total for humanitarian assistance thus far granted to the region to £750,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed the Honduran Government of my decision to make available to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas &ndash; APSO &ndash; a group of volunteers from the Defence Forces to help in the construction of a medical centre and school in Santa Rosa Aguan destroyed by hurricane Mitch. Twenty seven Army personnel have been despatched to the area and are currently engaged on the construction projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government intends to remain engaged with the reconstruction effort and is open to providing further aid, especially for rehabilitation. With this in mind an Irish aid technical team is currently in the region to conduct the necessary professional assessment of current and longer <Col N="203" /> term needs so that decisions can be taken on how best we can contribute to the international reconstruction and rehabilitation effort.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to prevent EU states from renationalising their own beef and sheep markets using the country of origin labelling system; if this matter will be raised during the Agenda 2000 talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the degree of market renationalisation for beef products in some key EU markets at the current time. As with most products there is always some tendency to favour those of domestic origin as opposed to the imported product and the situation is no different with beef or sheepmeat. However, since the initial BSE problems which commenced in the early 90s and which reached a crisis point in 1996 there has been a major increase in market renationalisation on some EU markets for beef and this has impacted severely on Irish exports. This renationalisation has been reinforced by the EU labelling regulation which came into force for fresh and frozen beef in all member states last year. The introduction of the beef labelling regulation was in response to the fall in beef consumption following the BSE crisis and the requirement on the part of consumers for reliable and accurate information about the beef on sale. The beef labelling scheme is optional until 1 January 2000 but any claims made on labels or point of sale notices before that date must be approved by the authorities in each member state. From the 1 January 2000 all beef must be labelled and there will <Col N="204" /> be a requirement also from that date to indicate the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived.</P>
      <P>There has been no EU labelling regulation introduced for sheepmeat.</P>
      <P>I have made very clear to the EU Commission the negative effects of the move towards renationalisation on the level of Irish exports to other member states and on producers prices in this country. The fact that we must rely to a greater extent than we should on intervention and export refunds, despite a substantial difference in cattle prices in this country and in other member states, is a result of renationalisation. I have emphasised that the effects of the proposals for reform of the beef sector, as presented under Agenda 2000, must be assessed for Ireland in the context of an EU market where renationalisation has become a reality.</P>
      <P>I would also add that An Bord Bia has formulated a strategy for achieving greater penetration of EU markets in the light of the more difficult market environment.</P>

      <P>In my reply on 27 January 1999 to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 357 and 358 about recombinant bovine somatotropin, I stated that the European Commission has not yet come forward with the results of the assessment it was asked by the Council to conduct concerning the use of the substance, nor with any specific proposals concerning its status after the end of this year. Consequently, the opportunity for discussions in this regard with my European counterparts has not yet arisen.</P>

      <P>Distribution of unused quota free of charge is decided each year by the Minister, following the recommendations of a representative review group. To date special priority has been given to smaller, less well off producers and to new entrants. Organic producers may qualify for quota under the terms of these criteria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The arable aid support system incorporates two schemes. The simplified scheme is confined to producers who are claiming compensation on a maximum of 15.13 hectares of cultivated land. There is no set-aside requirement under this scheme. The general scheme is open to all arable producers irrespective of the areas sown, but has a set-aside requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term set-aside in the context of arable aid payments means the leaving fallow of land which in the previous year had been cultivated to crops <Col N="208" /> or set-aside as part of a publicly funded set-aside scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the conditions of the 1998 general scheme, producers were required to set aside a minimum of 5 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent of their total arable area. These limits have been amended to 10 per cent and 20 per cent respectively for 1999.</P>
    <P>Payment in respect of set-aside land under the 1998 general scheme was at the rate of £347.13 per hectare. Following are the ten highest payments to general scheme applicants in 1998 in respect of their arable land which was set aside under that scheme: £33,216.87; £23,177.87; £19,408.04; £18,307.64; £15,853.43; £14,905.76; £14,853.69; £14,464.90; £14,322.58; £14,183.73.</P>

    <P>5. 2nd ten month application in respect of 71 <Col N="210" /> animals submitted on 30 November 1998. This application was the subject of a field inspection. During the course of that inspection, it was discovered that four of the animals applied for were not present in the herd at the time of application and were duly rejected with penalties. The herdowner was notified of this rejection in a letter dated 19 February 1999. He was also advised of his right to appeal this decision.</P>

The judgments of the Supreme Court did not deal with the entitlements of individual plaintiffs but referred the matter to the High Court for assessment of damages. The claims made raise complex issues still to be determined by the courts.</P>
      <P>The first of these cases is listed for hearing in the High Court beginning on 2 March 1999.</P>

      <P>An essential prerequisite for eligibility under the hardship grant scheme is that the herdowner is not in receipt of off-farm income. The herdowner named indicated in his application form that he had off-farm income. He has since confirmed to the satisfaction of the local district veterinary office that he is not in receipt of off-farm income. Payment of his hardship grant for the period from the date of the herd retest, i.e. 19 December 1998, to the date the holding was derestricted, i.e. 16 February 1999, will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>At EU level, it is my objective to ensure that the CAP support system for beef is such as to support and encourage the development of the sector from primary production on farms right along the production and processing chain to the placing of the final product on the retail shelves. Of crucial importance in this context is the establishment of suitable and adequate support systems for primary producers. Also, given our dependence on exports, an appropriate export policy must be an integral part of this framework. The contribution of An Bord Bia is important in supporting the marketing efforts of the industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 122 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Research and development is ongoing within the sheep sector and covers a wide range of areas from primary production and breeding to marketing and sales. In relation to breeding and production, it is carried out mainly by the Department, Teagasc and the universities. The main objective of this is to improve the efficiency of Irish sheep production by focusing on the quality and meat yield of the lamb crop.</P>
      <P>As regards market research, this is largely a matter for An Bord Bia who, in conjunction with the industry, focus their efforts on the EU market which is our main lamb export outlet. Given that France accounts for almost three quarters of our export sales, 43,000 tonnes in 1998, market research and promotion naturally concentrate on this market to a greater degree than elsewhere. Market research in relation to the sale of light lamb tends to focus on Southern European countries including Spain, Portugal and Italy. Research has been done also to assess the possibilities for increasing our sales in Germany and in the Nordic countries.</P>
      <P>While the industry has made considerable progress in establishing valuable export markets for Irish lamb, it is my intention to ensure that improvements in quality and traceability are such as to ensure we are in a position not only to consolidate but to increase our presence on these markets.</P>

      <P>The payment position with regard to headage and premium schemes is outlined in the following table, which indicates in overall terms a very satisfactory level of service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any outstanding cases which have not been fully paid under the headage and suckler cow premium schemes are problem cases of one kind or another. For example some 1,400 cases under both the cattle headage/beef cow scheme and the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme have not been cleared for payment because they are under query with the farmer concerned. Over 1,000 suckler cow applicants will not qualify for payment because they do not have suckler cow <Col N="217" /> quota. Almost 750 applicants under the sheep headage scheme did not submit an area aid form or have sufficient area to qualify for payment and a further 370 cases are under query at local office level. Likewise under the equine and goat headage schemes, over 420 cases in total are under query while a further 175 cases have area aid related queries including failure to submit an area aid application.  Payment under the October 1998 suckler cow scheme cannot be made until after the six month retention period expires at the end of April 1999.  The fact that Ireland has exceeded its national quota under the 1998 special beef premium scheme means that 20 per cent balancing payments cannot commence until all ten month applications submitted under the scheme, have been examined and processed. In the meantime however, 80 per cent advances have been paid to November applicants and similar advances will be paid to December applicants in early March when their two month retention period has expired.  Payment of the third and final instalment under the 1998 ewe premium scheme will commence this week following publication of the EU regulation giving effect to the rate of premium. With regard to the 1998 extensification premium, payment is due to be made in the period May-June 1999.</P>
    <P>Not all applicants will ultimately qualify for payment as a certain percentage are deemed to be ineligible each year under the various headage and premium schemes. Under EU Regulations and in line with Charter commitments, full payments under the cattle premium schemes must be completed by 30 June in the year following the year of application.</P>

      <P>The outcome of negotiations on Agenda 2000, clearly will be a major factor affecting continuing production of cereals. It is my aim to ensure that any price reduction adopted will be the minimum needed to permit unsubsidised exports, that producers will be fully compensated for the resulting reduction in returns from the market and that a viable cereal producing sector is maintained.</P>

      <P>The dairy sector is regulated by means of the market support structure under the EU Common Organisation of the Market for Milk and Milk Products. Quotas on production are a particularly important part of the regime. The future of this support structure including prices and quota levels is being considered within the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It is my objective within these negotiations to seek the best possible result for Irish agriculture and as regards milk to ensure a support framework which is best suited to the Irish industry. Continued development of our already strong export performance must be a part of this framework.</P>

    <P>Secondary bond market turnover, which is based on data collected by the Irish Stock Exchange, was particularly high in 1996 and 1997 reflecting strong demand for Irish Government bonds in anticipation of yields converging with German bond yields in the run-in to EMU. However, as convergence had largely occurred by end 1997, turnover fell in 1998. This was a common feature of Government bond markets generally in the euro in 1998.</P>
    <P>The application of the Government bond market is primarily to fund the Government's financing requirements, that is, any shortfall between income and expenditure, together with the amount needed to fund maturing debt. The lower level of gross bond issuance in 1998 reflected the Exchequer surplus in that year.</P>
    <P>As regards the future of the Government bond market, I refer the Deputy to the statement by the NTMA in November 1998, outlining revised arrangements for bond issuance procedures and related debt management, including the primary dealer system. Under these arrangements, the NTMA recognised six primary dealers, with the obligation of quoting, on demand, firm bid and offer prices in each bond notified from time to time by the NTMA. The primary dealer structure is designed to add depth and liquidity to the Government bond market. It is envisaged that the NTMA and the recognised primary dealers will commit themselves to these arrangements for a period of at least two years. However, in the event of a material change in market circumstances either the NTMA or the primary dealers may seek to amend those arrangements; and, fol<Col N="222" /> lowing consultations between the NTMA and the primary dealers, the NTMA may revise the arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, which was enacted in July 1998, came into force on 1 January 1999. The Act provides for the establishment of a food safety authority which will have a board, a scientific committee and a consultative council. As the Deputy will be aware, one of the six North/South implementation bodies to be established under the Good Friday Agreement is in the field of food safety. Detailed arrangements for this body are currently being worked out and will inevitably have an impact on the functions envisaged for the FSAI under the 1998 Act. While I have appointed some members to the board of the FSAI to enable it to fulfil certain of its statutory functions, the FSAI has not yet proceeded to appoint the scientific committee or the consultative council pending final clarification of its role <i>vis-à-vis </i>the North/South implementation body.</P>

      <P>The funding of services, such as day activity and respite care services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the relevant health board. This year, a total of £13.4 million additional funding is being provided for the maintenance and development of services in this sector. Of this, £3 million, rising to £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000 is for the development of services and £4 million is for capital projects. The Western Health Board was allocated £0.3 million for development of services and £0.3 million for capital projects in its functional area. The expenditure of this funding is a matter for the board in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee, on which the IWA is represented. Accordingly, the IWA should take this matter up with the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>The funding of services for people with physical <Col N="224" /> and sensory disabilities, such as aids, appliances and personal assistance services is a matter for the health boards. In December 1998, I announced additional funding of £4 million for the provision of aids, appliances and other equipment, including accessible transport for people with disabilities. A total of £1.5 million from this funding was allocated to the health boards for the provision of these items in consultation and co-operation with the Irish Wheelchair Association. This year, a total of £13.4 million is being provided for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £3 million revenue &ndash; £6 million full year cost in the year 2000 &ndash; is for the development of services. Priorities for the allocation of this funding will be decided by boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. The IWA is represented on all such committees. The question of allocating funds for the provision of additional personal assistance services will be considered by each health board in this context.</P>

      <P>My Department recognises the valuable role played by both family support workers and home helps in supporting people in the home. However, <Col N="225" /> the underlying philosophy governing the operation of the existing home help scheme was that of a community based, part-time good neighbour scheme which would attract volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service and as such the service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.</P>
      <P>My Department does not set a pay rate or a travel allowance for this category of staff as the type of service given varies considerably in different health board regions. The rate paid to staff in these groups, and their terms and conditions, varies throughout the country since these rates are determined by the employing authority on the basis of their particular requirements and type of task undertaken. It is, therefore, a matter for the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board to decide on these issues.</P>
      <P>A report examining the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People has recently been presented to me and it is my intention that the recommendations of this report will be fully considered. I have recently provided additional resources to health boards to facilitate an increase in the rate of payment for all home helps to £3 per hour from 1 April 1999. This is part of a phased improvement, the remaining phases of which I hope to implement as resources permit. I understand that, following the lodgement of a national pay claim, the Health Service Employers Agency will be meeting with unions representing the staff, in the near future and that this matter will be dealt with through the normal industrial relations procedures.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system, is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the superintendent registrars and registrars who operate under his general direction. I have had inquiries made with An tArd-Chláraitheoir and I understand that a post-mortem examination was carried out in respect of the death referred to by the Deputy but that the report of the post-mortem cannot be finalised until the results of tests have been furnished by the histopathology department of Waterford Regional Hospital. The Deputy will appreciate that the provision of services in the histopathology department at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. The health board is committed to the continued development of these services in consultation with my Department, having regard to overall resources available and the board's many competing priorities, In this regard I am aware that the South-Eastern Health Board has recently held interviews for the appointment of a fourth consultant histopathologist for the region.</P>
      <P>When the report of the above mentioned post-mortem becomes available, it will have to be decided if the death should be referred to the coroner or alternatively, if the death should be registered on the signature of a qualified informant and on the production of a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a medical practitioner. If the death is referred to the coroner and she/he determines that an inquest is necessary, the registrar must await the issue of a coroners certificate before registering the death. If the coroner decides that an inquest is not required she/he will so advise the registrar and in these circumstances the death may be registered on foot of a medical certificate of cause of death.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Mater Hospital, Dublin 7, is unable to deal with any coronary by-pass patients on the elective list and admissions for surgery are solely from those already in hospital due to serious deterioration in their condition; and the proposals, if any, he has to deal with the shortage of nurses to provide theatre and intensive post-operative care which has resulted in this crisis.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5423/99]</QRef>

    <Col N="227" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mater Hospital is funded to provide 1,000 cardiac procedures per annum. I have recently been advised by the hospital that patients on the elective waiting list for cardiac surgery are not currently being admitted due to the unavailability of skilled nurses in its intensive care unit and operating theatres. However, the hospital continues to supply its emergency cardiac surgery service within available resources.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that officials from my Department met with the hospital authorities in January 1999 to review the outcome of the 1998 waiting list initiative and to discuss arrangements for dealing with the national cardiac waiting list during 1999. A further meeting regarding this issue has been arranged for later this week between officials from my Department and representatives from the three public sector adult cardiac centres. In the context of this meeting, it is intended to discuss the particular difficulties being experienced by the Mater Hospital, their proposals to resolve these difficulties and potential options which may be available to address these problems across all cardiac surgery sites.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. Despite the difficulties at the Mater Hospital in recent months, referred to above, the impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting &ndash; adults and children &ndash; at the end of September 1998 by 349. This represents a reduction of 22 per cent on the figure for September 1997. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to achieve an average six month waiting period for patients on the national cardiac surgery waiting list. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and University College Hospital, Galway, will help achieve that objective. The proposed additional target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG, which represents an increase in the existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity of over 50 per cent. Last week, I was pleased to announce that I have approved the acceptance of tenders for the new cardiac unit in St. James's Hospital at a total cost of £6.1 million. This development is scheduled for completion by the end of this year. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital, to provide for up to <Col N="228" /> an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent. Pending the completion of this infrastructural investment, I intend to use waiting list initiative funds to target those patients who have been waiting in excess of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that there is a pool of skilled staff available to the cardiac units when they are operational. To this end, in July 1998 I approved a programme of training for nurses and perfusionists at a cost in the region of £500,000 over a period of two years and this training is now under way at the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>The problem of nurse shortages is an issue which has become more apparent in recent times. While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency &ndash; HSEA. The HSEA established a task force in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I launched the competitions for places on this year's nursing diploma programmes on 20 January 1999. I also announced an increased annual maintenance grant of £3,250 payable to nursing students and the provision of funding of £350,000 to An Bord Altranais, which now manages the nursing careers centre, and various schools of nursing for a recruitment campaign, at both national and local level, aimed at attracting more young people to enter nursing. The closing date for applications for nurse training was last Friday 19 February. I am pleased to note that approximately 6,000 applications have been received which represents a 50 per cent increase on 1998. I am hopeful that a full uptake of all the available training places will result from this increased level of interest.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that Ireland is not in a unique position in relation to the shortage of nurses. The reality is that the United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Nurses with specialist qualifications in areas such as cardiac care are particularly sought after. Arising from the work of the task force, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad. The response of the nursing unions to these measures has been positive. In addition, the HSEA has agreed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. The HSEA expects to be in a position to announce details of this scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the difficulties being experienced by hospitals in recruiting nurses, it should be noted that my Department engaged a nurse researcher in late 1998 to specifically study nurs<Col N="229" /> ing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons why nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Labour Court recently recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas, including theatre and intensive care, and who hold special qualifications. The court also accepted that there are grounds for improvements in the pay of ward sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the report of the Commission on Nursing and recommended that the parties enter into discussions immediately on implementation of that report, those discussions to be completed by 1 May 1999 at which stage the parties are to report back to the court.</P>
    <P>I announced on 10 February that the Government was prepared to accept the Labour Court recommendations. The Deputy will be aware that discussions between the HSEA and the nursing unions began last week. I am confident that the process which is now under way provides a way forward for implementing the report of the Commission on Nursing which sets out a coherent framework for the future development of the nursing profession and contains a large number of wide-ranging recommendations designed to address the real underlying problems within nursing.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to allay any fears of parents of paed<Col N="230" /> iatric haematology patients undergoing treatment at the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House earlier this month, on 3 February, there is no question of either the paediatric haematology unit at Tallaght being closed or of patients currently undergoing treatment in Tallaght being transferred to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Neither are there any plans to centralise paediatric haematology in Crumlin.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the only change to the current paediatric oncology and haematology services will be that in future, children diagnosed with cancer &ndash; as distinct from children with other haematology disorders &ndash; will be referred for an initial assessment at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>I recently met with representatives from CHILD &ndash; Children's Hospital in Leukaemia Drive &ndash; and I reassured them that there would be no transfer of resources, whether equipment or staff, from the new unit at Tallaght. The decision made regarding cancer treatment will also not affect current services being provided for children at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to the Chairman of the National Children's Hospital setting out my desire for a structured collaboration between the three Dublin children's hospitals. In this context, I feel that it should now be possible to develop a positive agenda for improvement of paediatric services to which each hospital can subscribe. I would again emphasise that primacy must be given to the best interests of our sick children, including those requiring oncology and haematology services.</P>

      <P>The section of the scheme to provide a main from Ballyshannon to Ballitore, including a booster pumpstation, is expected to get to construction this year. Contract documents covering the remainder of the scheme were submitted to my Department in 1994 but have not been approved. As this part of the project is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme it comes within the terms of my Department's Circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. The circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority list will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-06. In the meanwhile it will be considered, along with all other competing proposals, under the rural towns and villages initiative, details of which will be announced shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Part B of the building regulations, which came into effect on 1 June 1992, sets out the requirements in relation to fire safety in the design and construction of new buildings and the extension of, or material alteration to, existing buildings. Houses built and-or extended in accordance with the 1991 edition of Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; which provides guidance on how to comply with the regulations &ndash; should be fitted with battery operated smoke alarms. Battery operated smoke alarms are cheap to buy &ndash; less than £10 &ndash; and easy to install. However, householders often forget to check that the batteries are operating. For example, only three-fifths of householders in the survey referred to by the Deputy had checked their smoke alarms within the past 12 months. Once the batteries run out, the smoke alarms become inoperative. For this reason, I published a revised and upgraded Technical Guidance Document B (Fire Safety) in December 1997, which recommends that houses built and-or extended on or after 1 July 1998 should be fitted with mains operated smoke alarms, rather than battery operated alarms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> I have no proposals to introduce legislation to provide for mandatory installation of smoke alarms in existing dwellings generally. Fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. I note that 45 &ndash; 64 per cent &ndash; of the 70 existing houses covered by the Kilbeggan secondary school survey were fitted with smoke alarms. My hope would be that we will ultimately achieve fitment of smoke alarms in close to 100 per cent of existing houses. However, I think that this can best be done by enlisting the voluntary co-operation of householders, in the interest of the safety of themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. Particular stress has been placed in its campaigns on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives. The council has also carried out a campaign in recent years to install smoke alarms in houses occupied by the elderly and other vulnerable persons. In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in their rented dwellings.</P>

While it did not submit an IAP for Wexford town on this occasion, the Council, however, asked for an extension of the time period to the current scheme in both Wexford town and Enniscorthy.

      <P>Designations under the new urban renewal scheme announced last week were based on integrated area plans submitted by local authorities and in line with recommendations made by an expert advisory panel which I established to assess all the plans submitted. Guidelines for the new urban renewal scheme made it clear that in selecting areas for the preparation of integrated area plans local authorities were expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and the highest concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Gorey, in common with several other smaller towns, was unsuccessful in getting a recommendation for approval from the expert panel as its size made it impossible for it to meet the criteria for the new scheme and it failed to advance convincing arguments for treatment as a special case. The expert panel found, however, that many of the smaller towns which had not been recommended for designation, contained a significant amount of urban townscape which had deteriorated badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The townscape restoration scheme which I announced last week is aimed at the restoration and conservation of townscapes in smaller towns. Local authorities, including Wexford County Council, will be asked to submit urban townscape plans by 1 August next. Guidelines are being prepared for issue to local authorities to assist them <Col N="235" /> in preparing plans for this new scheme which is to be introduced in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back-to-work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to the long-term unemployed to return to work. The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted primarily at those on long-term unemployment and one-parent family payments. However, 1,000 places have been reserved for people with disabilities of a long-term nature, namely, persons in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension. Disability benefit is not regarded as a long-term payment and there are no plans to have it included as a qualifying payment for the allowance.</P>
      <P>In the case of disability benefit and other schemes for incapacitated people there are arrangements in place under which, in certain circumstances, recipients can take up employment of a therapeutic or rehabilitative nature with a view to their return to the workforce.</P>

      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grant schemes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>One of the grant schemes operated by my Department is the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations under which once-off grants are provided to help voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas. Grants may be made available under this scheme towards the cost of renovation or acquisition of premises or the purchase of equipment.</P>
      <P>The group referred to in the Deputy's question has submitted an application to the south-eastern regional office for funding towards the cost of extension of the premises under the above scheme. The cost of the proposed extension is substantial. The work of the centre primarily covers services that are the responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board and the group has been advised to make an application to the health board for funding towards this project. The regional office has also been in discussions with the health board with regard to the application.</P>
      <P>I am favourably disposed to making a contribution towards these capital costs. However, the costs involved are substantial and the support of the centre's services is primarily the responsibility of another agency. My Department is not in a position to consider making a contribution towards this project unless the balance of the necessary funds has been secured from other sources. As I announced at the beginning of this month, Carlow is one of the areas identified for the expansion of the community development and family and community resource centre programmes. The location of the projects is to be decided following further consultation locally. The group referred to in the Deputy's question will be included in that consultation process.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as Community Alert which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;panic button&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office in June 1997, the multi-annual budgets for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 for this scheme had been set by the previous Government at £2 million each year. In 1997, I requested the Government to increase this £2 million for that year by £3 million to £5 million and that was agreed. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.</P>
      <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on the scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of the ten regional offices of my Department which process grant applications under the scheme receive an annual allocation, based on the level of application for each region, from the total sum allocated to the scheme in each year's budget. The regional offices then allocate funding <Col N="238" /> to individual groups in their area taking into account the merit of individual applications and the overall level of resources available.</P>
    <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under the scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received.</P>
    <P>Details of grants paid to voluntary groups and organisations under the scheme up to the end of 1998 are held in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members. I am anxious to ensure the scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how it is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the operation of the scheme in 1999 will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The object of a preservation order is to safeguard a monument, which is considered to be a national monument, and which is in danger of being or is actually being destroyed, injured, or removed, or is falling into decay through neglect. The effect of a preservation order is that it shall not be lawful for any person to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter or in any manner <Col N="240" /> injure or interfere with any such national monument; to excavate, dig, plough, or otherwise disturb the ground within, around or in proximity to any such national monument without the written consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It shall not be lawful to sell for exportation or to export any such national monument or any part thereof.</P>
      <P>The statutory basis for preservation orders is contained in section 8 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, and section 3 of the National Monuments (Amendment ) Act, 1954. There is provision in section 4 of the 1954 Act for temporary preservation orders, which remain in force for a period of six months, and which can be made where I, as Minister, consider a national monument to be in immediate danger of injury or destruction. By virtue of a preservation order, any person found injuring the monument or interfering with it is liable on conviction to heavy penalties, as set out in section 17 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>

      <P>While each visa application is examined on its merits, my Department's general approach is that a visa required national may join a spouse who is in possession of a valid work permit once the worker has become established in ongoing employment in the State, usually after 12 months, and provided the worker is in a position to provide for his or her family members without recourse to public funds. Exceptions are, however, made in order to secure the services of highly skilled workers whose expertise is of vital importance to certain sectors of the economy and who would not take up an appointment otherwise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent media reports, and of the issue of e-mail addresses, to which the Deputy is referring. The National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, which I established last year to implement the Schools IT 2000 Programme, supplied all schools with guidelines on the safe use of the Internet in August 1998. These guidelines outline the possible dangers inherent in Internet use, including the use of e-mail by primary school children, and the steps which can be taken to alleviate these dangers. The guidelines are available on the Internet at http://www.ncte.ie/safety.</P>
      <P>The NCTE is presently compiling a further set of guidelines which will assist primary schools in devising a policy on acceptable use of the Internet, including Internet e-mail. These guidelines are being prepared in consultation with the teacher unions and parent bodies and will be circulated to all primary schools shortly. Ultimately, each school will devise and implement its own Internet safety policy in collaboration with management, teachers and parents.</P>
      <P>Every primary school received Internet filtering software with the computer supplied to them by Telecom Éireann under the Schools IT 2000 Programme. This allows schools to block access from that computer to web sites containing inappropriate material. The options for centralising filtering of Internet material being accessed from school computer networks are currently being investigated by the NCTE and a pilot study involving four schools will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, in co-operation with RTE and BOCOM International, my Department has conducted a pilot study which involved broadcasting Internet material to schools using a television signal, thereby allowing schools to use predetermined Internet content without having to access the Internet. The results of this study are currently being evaluated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175, 176, 177, 181, 185 and 186 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer the Deputies to my reply to Deputy Bruton's Priority Question of 2 December 1998 where I dealt with this matter at length. On that occasion I expressed the firm view that the Department's response to the complaint submitted in 1982 was seriously lacking. Furthermore, as an indication of my willingness <Col N="246" /> to be as open and helpful as possible on this particularly disturbing case, I offered access to the Department's file on the matter to any Deputy in the House with an interest in the case. I can assure the Deputies that this offer still stands.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that people who suffer abuse of the kind which occurred in this case should have available to them adequate professional counselling and support services where they need it to deal with the hurt and trauma caused by the abuse. For adults who were victims of sexual abuse as children such services are available from the health boards, while my Department, through the psychological service, focuses on the needs of children. The provision of counselling and support services to people who as children were victims of sexual abuse is one of the issues being examined by a Cabinet sub-committee set up under my chairmanship last December to review issues relating to sexual abuse. One of the key objectives of the sub-committee is to find effective ways to help victims of abuse access the kind of supports they need to help them with the long-term effects of the abuse. The sub-committee, as part of its work, is considering developments in this area internationally. It hopes to report to the Cabinet in the near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the letter referred to by Deputy Flanagan, I accept that the author should have received an immediate response when it was received in 1982. I am not sure if he would wish to have a response at this stage or if that would be in any way useful to him 17 years later. I am, however, prepared to make officials of my Department available to the person in question should he wish to discuss issues related to his letter.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, this case has been dealt with in the courts following a Garda investigation and accordingly a full inquiry has already been conducted. I am satisfied that the existing procedures within my Department, which are much more stringent than those applying in the 1960s or in 1982, are sufficient to ensure that a situation like that which arose in this case cannot be repeated. I have instructed my officials to ensure that procedures relating to sex abuse should be kept under continuous review to ensure the adequate protection of school children. I can assure Deputies that there is no complacency in my Department on this matter, as demonstrated in particular by the current review of procedures which is taking place with the Department of Health and Children. The completion of this review is a high priority. I will ensure that updated guidelines will be issued to all schools as soon as possible after that review is completed.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken action which has as its aim the more general protection of children from child abuse. Earlier this month the Government approved the preparation of a Bill <Col N="247" /> which would provide for greater protection of children from the actions of sex offenders, including the establishment of a sex offenders register, the principal focus of which would be offenders against children. The Bill would also give the courts power to order post-release supervision of sex offenders.</P>
    <P>I am sure that this House is aware that I deplore the abuse which occurred in this case but Deputies will also be aware that the allegations relating to the teacher concerned were not brought to the attention of the Department until 1982 while the abuse actually occurred in the mid to late 1960s. The aspect of this case which leaves the Department open to serious criticism relates to the failure to take action in 1982 to ensure, as far as the Department could, that the allegations then made were properly investigated. I accept, as I have stated previously, that the Departments response at that time was seriously lacking and, although I was not Minister at that time, I deeply regret that.</P>
    <P>Finally, in response to Deputy Bruton's query, I wish to emphasise that, while I am aware of media reports indicating that complaints were made against the teacher in question in 1969, I have been informed by officials of my Department that there is no record of any such complaints or petition having been sent to the Department at that time. Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to convey these details directly to the victims themselves, as their names and addresses have not been disclosed. If they contact my Department seeking this information it will, of course, be made available to them.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending.</P>
      <P>In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college. If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which she or he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
      <P>I previously indicated my concern about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. As part of my plans to tackle educational disadvantage at third level, I recently announced total additional funding of £6.9 million to be allocated over the next two years to address such issues. Included in this allocation is provision of £2.4 million to fund an improvement of the maintenance grants scheme so that all eligible mature students will now qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. The new arrangements will be provided for in the context of the 1999 student support schemes, which will be available later in the year.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the award of a grant is the candidate's gross income from all sources and that of his or her parents or guardians where applicable.</P>
      <P>I understand from Limerick County Council that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limit for the payment of a maintenance grant. Based on the details of reckonable income supplied, the student in question qualifies for a fees only grant.</P>
      <P>I further understand from the local authority that the student concerned has requested that her application be re-assessed under the change in circumstances clause of the higher education grants scheme. Under this clause, a local authority may reassess a students eligibility for grant assistance if there has been a change of circumstances relating to the following: the candidate's reckonable income, which is likely to be permanent; the number of dependent children; the number of children in full-time third level education or attending other courses of education as specified in the scheme; normal residence.</P>
      <P>Limerick County Council requested evidence of the change in circumstances in December last. To date, the student has not provided this evidence to the local authority and, therefore, it has not been possible for the local authority to reassess her application.</P>

      <P>My Department, in association with RTE and BOCOM International, implemented a project in the first half of 1998 to broadcast selected Internet sites and materials to 50 schools at primary and second level and to five libraries. One of the aims of this project was to determine the educational benefits of the Internet for schools. My Department is currently studying an evaluation of this project.</P>
      <P>Under the Schools IT 2000 initiative, I will shortly launch ScoilNet as part of the School Support Initiative. The National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, has made available a ScoilNet prototype website on the Internet since September 1998. Since then the NCTE has been taking submissions from a wide range of end-users in education on how they would wish to see ScoilNet developing in order that the best educational benefits may be derived from Internet use. This interaction will continue even after the official launch of ScoilNet to ensure that the educational needs of schools can be identified and met as appropriate through Internet use.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall evaluation of the Schools IT 2000 initiative, which runs until the end of the year 2000, my Department will undertake a study into the educational benefits of the Internet with specific reference to ScoilNet.</P>
