      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if projects promoting reconciliation between North-South and East-West only were selected for funding under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund; whether the funds were distributed only to organisations actively concerned with reconciliation, that favour the Good Friday Agreement and are not engaged in any sectarian activities; the criteria considered in the distribution of the funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17325/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a question on this matter on 1 June last, the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, provides that the money received from the trust be disposed of for the purposes of projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>In December of last year, my Department placed advertisements in the Irish national and Northern Irish newspapers as well as the <i>Irish Post</i> in Britain, inviting applications from organisations or individuals for funding for projects which would fall under the terms of the 1988 Act and, in particular, would promote mutual understanding and reconciliation, or which would sustain and develop ventures on an island of Ireland basis or which would promote the welfare of the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing submissions, priority was given to organisations that would have difficulty obtaining commercial sponsorship or where the organisation or proposal would not normally or readily be funded by other Departments, statutory agencies or other public authorities, by reference to functions discharged or services provided. Furthermore, because of the relative availability of funding from other sources for North-South co-operation, priority was accorded to projects or <Col N="790" /> undertakings as between the State and Britain, and relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>Following an assessment process which was undertaken by the interdepartmental committee, 59 applications were selected which best met the criteria for disbursement of the funds available. Included among these are a significant number containing cross-community or cross-traditional elements that provide opportunities for the Government to demonstrate, in a practical way, the commitments entered into under the Good Friday Agreement to promote reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between the people of Ireland and Britain and to show respect for the diversity of traditions on the island.</P>
    <P>Reflecting the priorities decided by me, 52.6 per cent of the total funding was allocated on an east-west basis, 36.2 per cent to projects involving the Irish community in Britain and 16.4 per cent to the other projects involving east-west co-operation. Some 47.4 per cent of the funding was allocated to projects on the island of Ireland, 32 per cent to projects relating to the island of Ireland as a whole and 15.4 per cent to projects involving North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>The 59 projects selected constitute a balanced package and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to provide much needed assistance to so many worthwhile initiatives. I have previously circulated with my reply to questions a list of the successful applicants and I am doing so again with this reply. The 59 projects to be assisted are as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the total number of applications received and the amount of money allocated under this fund? How were these allocations made? Did an independent committee analyse the applications and make decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee, an assessment committee, made the recommendations. Several hundred applications were made. I put on the record previously information on this and I can provide it to the Deputy again. Some 59 were selected from what I understand to have been approximately 200 applications in the first instance. Before the advertisements were placed, selection was based on a set of criteria and terms of reference which were set down for the bodies to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that the Ulster Unionist Party was responsible for the insertion in the Good Friday Agreement of the words &ldquo;recognition of diversity of tradition&rdquo;. Will the Taoiseach provide an example of how this diversity of tradition was recognised in the allocations to the groups concerned? Is he happy that none of the organisations awarded allocations under this scheme was in any way involved in sectarian activities or in activities opposed to the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The RNLI is one such body which reflects the diversity of interests. Others include the Journey of Reconciliation Trust, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Cork Lions Club and the organisation involved in the restoration of the cenotaph. Some applications were ruled out by the group because it could not be certain of their bona fides. I am not aware, however, of the involvement of any organisation that had a difficulty with the Good Friday Agreement; none was brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may recall that when this matter was last raised in the House I <Col N="792" /> brought to his attention that the hospital in Leopardstown, which was established to care for the victims of the first and second world wars, was excluded from consideration by this committee on the grounds that it had access to other sources of funding, namely, from the health board and the Department of Health and Children. An undertaking was given that the deficit in its capital programme &ndash; a small amount of money &ndash; by which it was debarred from applying to this fund, notwithstanding that it was perhaps the most eminently qualified, given the title of the trust, would be made up by the Department of Health and Children or the health board. Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate whether an additional allocation was made to it above and beyond the amount it would normally get from the health board or the Department of Health and Children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the representations and that Deputy Quinn raised the matter in the House. I undertook not to give a commitment on the deficit but to ask the Department of Health and Children to look at it and to ask the Minister to visit the hospital. He has done that. I do not know the conclusions of that visit but I asked him, based on what was said during the debate here, to meet the board's representatives to see what could be done because of their circumstances. I can follow up on that if the Deputy wishes. Perhaps he ought to put down a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and ask him to follow up on this matter. As Deputy Kenny has said, the Unionist party sought the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;the recognition of the diversity of tradition on this island&rdquo;. Most of the people who were patients in that hospital, but not all, had fought in two world wars, certainly in the last world war. Many of them would have been of a Unionist persuasion, though not all, and they certainly fall into that category. Now that the Government has more money than it had anticipated, and since this is a capital application rather than a current account application, would the Taoiseach undertake to come back to me and let me know the outcome of the Minister's visit to that hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited Russia from 14 to 16 September on the first official bilateral visit by a Taoiseach. My visit had two main objectives: to strengthen bilateral political relations between our two countries and to promote Irish exports and business contacts in Russia. The visit was highly successful in both respects.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, my visit to Russia coincided with the terrorist atrocities which resulted in such a large loss of life in the Moscow area and elsewhere in Russia. I took the opportunity of my visit to convey the condolences of the Irish Government and people on these attacks.</P>
      <P>As regards the political element of my visit to Russia, I met Prime Minister Putin on Wednesday, 15 September. I also met Governor Mukha of Novosibirsk. On Thursday, 16 September, I met Mr. Seleznyov, Speaker of the Duma, Mr. Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow, Mr. Stroyev, Chairman of the Federation Council, Mr. Yakovlev, Governor of St. Petersburg and Former Prime Minister Primakov. In addition to these meetings, I had a series of trade related meetings with the accompanying business delegation and their Russian business contacts. I was accompanied during my visit to Russia by a large delegation representing 28 Irish companies, drawn from the software, telecommunications, educational services and agri-food sectors. I also met members of the Irish business and expatriate community in Russia.</P>
      <P>I discussed a wide range of issues during my meeting with Prime Minister Putin on 15 September, including the economic progress Russia has been making, the growing political and economic relations between our two countries, EU-Russia relations, Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the Council of Europe and the Northern Ireland Peace Process. I also raised the continued purchase of Irish beef by Russia. The Prime Minister assured me that the Russian veterinary authorities will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.</P>
      <P>We discussed East Timor and the question of an urgent and appropriate response from the international community. Prime Minister Putin also highlighted the potential difficulties ahead for the 150,000 refugees from Kosovo and Eastern Slavonia currently in Serbia as winter approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following our meeting, Prime Minister Putin and I signed Agreements on Co-operation in <Col N="795" /> Combating Illegal Drug Trafficking and Fighting Crime. The agreements essentially provide for co-operation, information exchange and expertise sharing. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will submit them to the House shortly for approval. The Prime Minister and I also issued a joint statement on bilateral co-operation in the field of management training for Russians.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland is seeking election to non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council next year for the term 2001-2002. I am heartened by the broad support which our candidacy has been attracting among many UN member states. Russia as a permanent member of the Security Council does not declare its position until the vote takes place. However, I was encouraged by the approach of Prime Minister Putin to this matter who noted the close coincidence in approach between our two countries towards many international issues.</P>
    <P>I met President Arafat at Shannon on 21 September. He arrived in Shannon from Cairo and he briefed me on his meeting there with President Mubarak. We discussed the outlook for the Final Status Negotiations, which were launched on 14 September. He also briefed me on the recently concluded Sharm-El-Sheikh Memorandum which restarted the implementation of the Wye Agreement and assured me that Palestinian commitments would be complied with in full. The President expressed his thanks for the support of the EU in relation to Sharm-El-Sheikh and for the Middle East Peace Process in general. We had a discussion about settlements and he briefed me on progress on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks of the Middle East Peace Process. I was pleased to learn from him that there has been some progress towards the construction of a port in Gaza. We also discussed bilateral relations between Ireland and the Palestinian Authority, including the opening of our representative office in Ramallah, which we intend will take place before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I will attend the Special European Council on Justice and Home Affairs in Tampere, Finland on 15 and 16 October. I will meet President Prodi who will also be attending the summit. Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland wrote to me on 27 September, setting out the draft agenda for the meeting. It is structured around three themes &ndash; immigration and asylum policy, a European judicial area, including improving citizens access to justice, and the fight against organised crime. I met with Prime Minister Lipponen on Wednesday last, 29 September, as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the special European Council. We discussed the draft agenda for Tampere and Ireland's priorities in the justice and home affairs area.</P>
    <P>My Department is in constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies abroad in relation to developments on the EU agenda. As I outlined to the House previously, I <Col N="796" /> have established a Cabinet committee, which I chair, to co-ordinate EU business. Its core members are the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General. Other Ministers attend, as appropriate, on particular issues. The forum allows for the required focus to be given to important issues which are arising on the EU agenda. The committee's next meeting will take place immediately in advance of the Tampere European Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to informal telephone contacts, it is increasingly the case that on the eve of each European Council I meet with Prime Minister Blair to discuss both developments in Northern Ireland and the issues on the agenda of the relevant Council. Most recently I met him in advance of the Cologne European Council and I plan to meet him again on the evening before the Tampere European Council.</P>
    <P>In relation to my future travel programme, I hope to visit Hungary, Slovenia and our Defence Force personnel serving with KFOR in Kosovo from 2 to 4 November. I will also be attending an OSCE summit of Heads of State and Government in Istanbul on 18 and 19 November and the European Council in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December. During my bilateral visits, I have extended invitations to all my counterparts to pay reciprocal visits to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met with the East Timorese leader, Xanana Gusmao, and his colleague, José Ramos Horta, yesterday. We had a useful discussion about the current situation in East Timor, the work of the UN International Commission of Inquiry, headed by Mrs. Mary Robinson, and the humanitarian and political support which is still required. There are no other inward visits by Heads of State or Government in my diary for this year.</P>
    <P>While I have not written to President Prodi in the last three months, he has written to me on the occasion of the investiture of the new Commission.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, may I ask if he raised with the Russian Government the question of Chechnya, in particular the bombing there and the attempt to bring about a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>, rather like the Israelis have in the Lebanon? What view did the Taoiseach take of that in his discussions with the Russian leaders? Will the Taoiseach confirm that representatives of the Goodman group were among the agri-business and food representatives who accompanied him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed the situation in Chechnya, Dagestan and the surrounding regions at length with Mr. Putin. The bombing, of course, had not commenced at that stage. The bombings occurred in Russia during the week I was in Moscow. I met people from different parties and groupings, both in the Administration and the <Col N="797" /> opposition. There was a united view that the bombings were connected with Chechnya. The view was that the authorities would have to do something. They explained to me the difficulties of what was happening in Chechnya. It has a population of 2.1 million people and 42 different communities, practically every one of which has sub-groups as well. They emphasised the difficulties in enforcing any kind of order there, but it was quite clear that they would endeavour to do so. They also stressed that the difficulties emanating from Chechnya were creating problems for them in Dagestan. They all emphasised the barbarity perpetrated against the people in the region, particularly in Dagestan, where there had been fairly horrific events that week. While no action had taken place at that stage, it was quite clear that they did intend to do something.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's second question, the answer is yes. At least one representative of the Goodman meat company was on the delegation. They are the biggest exporter of beef to Russia at present and one of the company's representatives attended the meetings.</P>

      <P>How were the 28 Irish companies selected? Does the Taoiseach believe it was particularly diplomatic to include in that group a company that had been fined in this jurisdiction for the export of substandard meat to Russia under the European Union intervention programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach states that he had no involvement, which is quite extraordinary. However, accepting his word that he had no involvement in the selection of these 28 representatives of Irish business, did anyone in his Department or in the Department of Foreign Affairs raise questions about whether difficulties might occur in respect of representatives of this company going on that particular visit, the first of its kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody raised it and there was no difficulty. Normally on these trade missions the statutory agencies inform the companies they believe would be interested in sending representatives that there is a trade mission and those <Col N="798" /> companies then indicate their interest. In this instance the company involved probably exports more to Russia than most of the other companies involved. I had no difficulty about or objection to its involvement, nor did that involvement create any problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach departed for Russia, was it brought to his attention that in the 1980s, under the EU aid scheme, green beef &ndash; by that I do not mean Irish beef &ndash; was exported by this company to Russia? Was it calculated to serve the best interests of the State to include in the deputation led by the Prime Minister of this country to Russia a person representing that company? Was this matter raised with the Taoiseach by the Russian authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not raised with me. However, it is clear that the company concerned is very highly thought of and well known within the political and business spheres in Russia. Most of the key political players I met, including the governor of St. Petersburg, the mayor of Moscow and others, are familiar with the company. The mayor of Moscow imports an enormous amount of beef because he has responsibility for food supply in Moscow, which is a very big city, and the company in question is well known to him. As opposed to any critical remarks being made, many favourable remarks were made.</P>

      <P>Is it correct that the process of decision making in selecting 28 participating companies had nothing to do with the Taoiseach's office, that he was not consulted but was merely informed which ones had been selected, and that nobody in the Department of Foreign Affairs raised the possibility that there might have been a diplomatic difficulty, bearing in mind the past activities of the company in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the special summit on Third Pillar issues which will be held on 15 and 16 October, what attitude does the Taoiseach intend to take in respect of the Schengen Agreement and the issue of the free travel area versus the Schengen area? Does he agree it is incredible that Irish citizens travelling within the European Union must continue to show their passports while Icelandic or Norwegian citizens can, through the Schengen Agreement, gain access to the European Union without doing so? Does the Taoiseach intend to raise this issue? In relation to the question on the development of the EU agenda, with the appointment of Javier Solana as Minister of CFSP, does the Taoiseach agree it is clear the security and defence <Col N="799" /> policy, and perhaps even defence issues, will be more firmly on the agenda? Has the Taoiseach considered seeking the inclusion of the commitment under Article 5 of the Western European Union as a protocol rather than as a full treaty commitment in any future evolution of the European Union or merger of the European Union and the Western European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the second matter first, on the question of Mr. Solana and the fact that he has received the support of about ten countries for the Western European Union, I am sure that matter will be addressed in some form during the Council. The neutral countries have continued to indicate their lack of support for this. The question raised by Deputy Mitchell will become a major issue of the French Presidency. These matters may not be discussed at the next Intergovernmental Conference but they certainly will be discussed during the year 2000 and examination of them will be complete by the end of the French Presidency in December 2000. The French are pushing the agenda very much in line with what Deputy Mitchell stated. They want to see major change in the whole security operation; I think that will take some time to come through. As the Deputy is aware, we have taken the view that if the Western European Union integrates over time, that should exclude the Article 5 issues. There have not been any deliberations at this stage &ndash; I have not heard it mentioned nor is it in the papers for Tampere &ndash; on the Article 5 issues becoming a protocol. There is an active debate about how the other issues can be integrated and about what will happen to Article 5 issues. The view at the Cologne meeting was that the Article 5 issues should stay in the shell of the Western European Union and the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian and peacekeeping issues would come under the new body. That is where the matter rests as of now, but the Deputy is correct, I do not think it will rest there for long. There is effort on the part of a large group of countries &ndash; I believe ten &ndash; to ensure Mr. Solana is not only the CFSP host but also that the Western European Union will debate how this is dealt with. I am not sure whether it will be dealt with in Tampere or in Helsinki later in the year.</P>
      <P>I do not believe Schengen will come up in any major way but Tampere will be the first opportunity to start making use of the tools which are now at the disposal of the European Council following the Amsterdam Treaty. That allows us to co-operate in areas where it is difficult for individual states to move alone and they will seek ways to co-operate. The issue the Deputy raised may not form part of it but it is an ongoing agenda. If the Deputy is asking for my view, I would support anything that simplifies the system and eliminates unnecessary administrative burdens on people.</P>

      <P>On a separate matter, is the Taoiseach aware that in the proposed reorganisation of the Commission &ndash; in the senior posts other than those of Commissioner &ndash; Ireland does not have a Director General in the most recently published list? Has he raised this matter with President Prodi or did he at any stage instruct the Department of Foreign Affairs to raise this matter? Can we take it that, along with the European Central Bank, we have been relegated to second division in terms of having an Irish person at a top level in the administration of these bodies?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably the most powerful position. I do not have the record on this matter from Foreign Affairs but a number of Irish people have come through the system at various levels, not at the level the Deputy stated but in a number of positions. I do not know if the full list has been compiled; with people moving around it may not be completed, but Irish people have done fairly well in those areas and the Department of Foreign Affairs, like everybody else, is conscious of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Department of Foreign Affairs certainly was involved and I discussed these matters with Mr. Prodi earlier. He informed me about Mr. O'Sullivan at that meeting. We have a limited number of people in the Commission, that is true, and it is a pity we do not have more. The people who are there have done rather well in a number of areas and key positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I might travel a little further with the Taoiseach on the Third Pillar issue. Is the Taoiseach aware that during the reflection group and the Amsterdam Treaty intergovernmental process the previous Government negotiated and knocked in provisions under the Schengen free travel area, but because of our traditional position with Britain we have no choice but to remain within the common travel area for now? Will the Taoiseach raise at this summit meeting the possibility of Irish citizens being allowed to travel within the European Union on a lesser document than a passport, perhaps a driving licence or a social security document, without the necessity of introducing an identity card system here? This was raised by me and others and I think it would be possible if the Taoiseach were to give it a push. I am anxious that he should raise this matter because Irish citizens are concerned about this. It <Col N="801" /> is absurd that Icelandic and Norwegian citizens have greater ease of access than Irish citizens to the European Union and we have to find ways around that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development of the EU agenda and the Taoiseach's reference to the likelihood of the French Presidency putting the whole question of defence policy more firmly on the agenda, is this why he has had a change of heart on Partnership for Peace, so as to prepare us for participation in these looming tasks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the Deputy. The Schengen Agreement is not on the agenda for Tampere. I note what he has said for the future, but it is asylum and immigration policy, the judicial position of the future, co-ordination of policy. It will not come up on the agenda as drafted.</P>

What I am saying regarding the French position is what France is now indicating it will raise during its Presidency, which will be in the second half of next year. It has nothing to do with statements I have made over the past 12 months dealing with Partnership for Peace.</P>

        <b>:</b> In the Taoiseach's discussions with Mr. Gusmao of East Timor was the question of this Government's recognition of East Timor as an independent State raised? Why did the Government not take a bold step and formally recognise East Timor as soon as its people voted for independence, especially in view of the history of this country? Was the question of military supplies to Indonesia by Britain and the United States raised? Did the Taoiseach give any undertaking that he would use his close ties with the British Prime Minister and the American President to have the disgusting sale of military hardware and arms to Indonesia ended for all time? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to bring the Taoiseach back to his visit to Russia and the report he gave to the Dáil. He was widely quoted in the media here while he was there as promising every support to the Russian Government against terrorism. On reflection, in view of the fact that the Government and Prime Minister he was dealing with has 5 per cent popular support in the most recent opinion poll, was the Taoiseach wise in the confidence he was investing in that Government? While every right thinking person would obviously absolutely condemn the bombing outrage, is the Taoiseach aware that in the wake of the bombing a major witch hunt was launched against people of Cauca<Col N="802" /> sian origin in Moscow?

        <b>:</b> The Deputy will have to read a little bit about the history of international socialism; he will find I come from an entirely different tradition. To finish my question, the support the Taoiseach was giving Mr. Putin and the Government could be interpreted as supporting these attacks on civil rights. Also, the indiscriminate bombing of Chechen villages has just started again, killing innocent men, women and children. Does the Taoiseach now regret the blanket support he gave the Russian Government, which is, incidentally, alleged to be riddled with corruption apart from being responsible for these infringements of civil rights?</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, several hundred people were blown to pieces in their sleep in Moscow by people who were not concerned with humanitarianism. I talked to Prime Minister Putin for three hours. He is in Government but I also spoke to Mr. Luzhkov, Mr. Stroyev and Mr. Primakov, who are the three leaders of the opposition who have come together to fight the elections in December and next summer. Regardless of whom I spoke to, they sought co-operation from countries who could help them in the fight against all kinds of terrorism and they have already received commitments from both the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner to assist them. The ongoing issues will always be taken into account by the Department of Foreign Affairs as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to my meeting with the leaders of East Timor, we discussed those issues. If the Deputy puts down a Question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about how the international agreements were worked through he will get a reply. What happens in terms of recognition will have to be worked through diplomatically. The reason Mr. Gusmao came here was to thank this country and Irish people, and to ask for our co-operation in continuing to highlight their cause in the UN, on Mrs. Mary Robinson's investigative commission and in Europe. These are issues on which we have <Col N="803" /> close affiliation with the people of East Timor and I think we can assist them. We can keep up the campaign to get their people back from Java and from the camps in West Timor, with the assistance of the various aid agencies, and we will assist in that. I have no difficulty with what the Deputy said about armaments and I share his concern. We shall do all we can to highlight how people abuse arms and how the arms industry uses its power in abusive ways.</P>

This morning the Cabinet sanctioned additional troops for East Timor and the increasing demands on the Defence Forces to be in so many locations create huge problems in terms of human and equipment resources.

Does the Taoiseach agree that both matters are intrinsically linked given we cannot exercise independence in determining who should come into Ireland because of our agreement with Britain, an issue highlighted when a Japanese national was denied access here because she was denied access to Britain, and that the administration of our dealings with asylum seekers and our independence of action is adversely affected because of the application by immigration officials of the common travel area arrangement with Britain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still retained and will continue to be an issue as regards the opt-out clause, but it will not arise or change in the short-term. The issue in Tampere is to try to adopt a unified approach that will not exclude us or Britain agreeing to the conditions which we are trying to do as regards asylum and immigration issues. The broad context varies from country to country. How people are treated and cared for and understandings between countries are, quite frankly, all over the place and what is being attempted in Tampere is a unified approach. People have worked on this for a long time &ndash; it is the first meeting dealing with justice and home affairs issues and only the second time ever a European <Col N="804" /> Council meeting has been dedicated to a single issue. It is an effort to try to achieve some order in this area and the Schengen process will not prevent us in any way from dealing properly and equally with the countries of the EU on the asylum issue.</P>

The picture he painted in the media over the past 24 hours is of a country that is devastated. Most of the buildings of any benefit to them have been burnt and destroyed. Many of the people who will help to rebuild the country are in Java but they will also need outside help.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>the amount of land which has been serviced under the terms of the serviced land initiative; the number of sites for development which are provided on that serviced land; the numbers of housing units which have been constructed on that land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the serviced land initiative 166 schemes put forward by the local authorities have been approved to service in excess of 15,000 acres of land or more than 100,000 new house sites. Details of the schemes approved are set out in the reply to Question No. 605 on 29 September 1999. All qualifying schemes in the major urban areas and their transport catchments submitted to the Department were approved. Special funding has been provided for the initiative and local authorities, which are responsible for implementing the schemes, have been asked to progress approved projects as a priority.</P>
      <P>It is not possible from the returns submitted by the local authorities to indicate the number of new house starts to date that are directly related to the initiative. In all, 99 schemes are scheduled to get to construction this year which will produce in the region of 60,000 additional sites. A further 43 schemes, representing 35,000 more sites, will commence next year. Once a scheme is in progress, work on the related housing can start.</P>
      <P>The serviced land initiative is an addition to the schemes in my Department's main water services investment programme which is expanding water services infrastructure generally and increasing its capacity to facilitate new housing and other development. It is part of a comprehensive range of measures to accelerate the supply of housing to achieve balance in the housing market and to stabilise house prices.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has and is being made in increasing housing output. Last year's record level of more than 42,000 new house completions is likely to be bettered this year. This is impacting positively on house prices. For example, statistics for the June quarter show significant moderation in the trend of new house prices which are the lowest at any time since 1996. Substantial increases in the volume of planning permissions in the first half of the year also point to increased availability of serviced land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the schemes and associated sites he mentioned are additional to what would have been there in any event? How many of the 99 schemes which he expects to start this year will produce houses this year or next year? Does the Minister agree it is disingenuous to congratulate himself on the fact that the trend in the rate of increase in new house prices is at its lowest since 1996? The Minister is saying that since 1996 new house prices increased <Col N="807" /> at a considerable rate for three years on the trot and they are now increasing only slightly less quickly. The addition to the price of a new house for first time buyers in particular is still crippling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the serviced land initiative means increased output in the housing area. The measures are additional to the usual programme in the Department and they are carefully monitored by the Department. The serviced land initiative will provide over 41,000 extra sites in Dublin, almost 4,000 in Kildare, 4,244 in Meath and 4,190 in Wicklow. Cork and Galway will have almost 11,000 extra sites while Limerick will have almost 9,000 and Waterford over 3,000 extra sites. These are the major centres and many other sites will be made available in other areas of the country. I am satisfied that it is an extra provision. I am also satisfied that extra houses will be built this year on foot of the serviced land initiative.</P>
      <P>As I said, it is not possible from the returns submitted by local authorities to indicate the actual number of new houses but all the trends, including the increased number of planning permissions and house completions, indicate that the serviced land initiative in addition to all the other measures taken by the Government is having an effect on house prices.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I met with the Governor of the Central Bank on Thursday last, 30 September, regarding the issue of lending institutions' mortgage lending policies. I expressed my concern about recent publicity suggesting a loosening of credit standards in the mortgage lending area and the effect this could have on house price trends. My concern arises from the fact that any significant increase in mortgage credit could fuel renewed house price escalation and serve to undo the progress being made to restore balance to the housing market. Any relaxation of lending policies could also result in borrowers taking on commitments which they might not be able to meet in the event of an increase in mortgage interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governor confirmed that the Central Bank shares these concerns and assured me that the bank would continue to monitor lending practices closely to ensure that the highest standards continue to be observed. I understand that the Governor has written again to lending institutions <Col N="809" /> seeking assurances that their lending policies continue to reflect the highest prudential standards. It was agreed with the Governor that officials of my Department and the Central Bank will meet regularly to continue to assess all developments in the area of mortgage lending.</P>

      <P>The practice agreed by the banks themselves some time ago and used as a guideline by them up to recently was two and a half times the principal earner's income plus the subsidiary earner's income.

In his second report, Mr. Peter Bacon made it clear that the idea of changing the lending criteria should not be considered until the levels of supply and demand were more equal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is on his way to Maynooth to discuss this matter with the hierarchy. Why did he select just one church, the Roman Catholic Church, or does he wish to include other churches? Everybody is aware of the great demand for housing land, particularly for social housing. Can the Minister say, even at this preliminary stage, if he has in mind a scheme which would require the churches to give their lands <i>gratis</i> to the State or is he seeking a discount rate for local authorities or voluntary housing associations should they purchase such lands?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy got the information that I was travelling to Maynooth. I did not select any one church; we have been in contact with both the Catholic Church and the representative body of the Church of Ireland. I am unaware of any huge land holdings held by the smaller religions in this country so obviously we have not made contact with them in that regard. We are talking in the same context here as with regard to State lands, that is, land being made available as a first option to local authorities for purchase at reasonable rates and agreed valuations, not confiscation or providing land <i>gratis</i>.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it is hypocritical of the State to ask the church to produce land for houses given that the State is the largest landowner? I can offer two examples. The Army has bases throughout the country and much of its land is not utilised. CIE is another example; it has large land bases which are not being utilised. What unit in the Department is considering an audit of State owned land? The time has come for such a unit to discuss regularly with other Departments how non-utilised State lands can be given over for local authority housing.</P>

We are now well on the way <Col N="812" /> to putting a specific unit into the Department to co-ordinate not just this aspect of housing development but all efforts in the context of the serviced land initiative and so forth. That unit is being put in place. We have received huge co-operation from the Department of Defence which is probably the biggest landowner.

      <P>We are trying to establish, through the local authorities, the amount of land that is available, particularly in built up areas. I cannot say if one could call that a formal audit. I have met county managers and local authorities throughout the country and a number of other meetings are due to be held. We are emphasising this matter and they are providing information to my Department and to the Department of Finance about available land. It is important to have as much information as possible, particularly with regard to built up areas, and to have the first bite of the cherry, as it were, in securing the land. Initially there was a fear among State agencies, particularly State and semi-State bodies, that we had in mind confiscation of the land or taking it over without paying&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of the assessments of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last, indicate a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing compared with 27,427 in March 1996. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households <Col N="813" /> were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by more measures, including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes. Due to the importance of these assessment figures, I have released the results of the assessment today in advance of their normal publication in the Department's housing statistics bulletin later this year as was the practice with previous assessments. The tables and associated commentary are being placed in the Oireachtas Library today.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the increased level of social housing need and considerable priority is being afforded to tackling this need. The Government has already taken action in advance of the results of the assessment. Increased resources are being provided for the local authority housing programme with 4,500 house starts or purchases provided for in 1999. The first ever multi-annual local authority housing programme will commence next year and provide 22,000 houses over the next four years. I am also committed to expanding voluntary housing output to deliver up to 4,000 additional units per annum over coming years.</P>
      <P>I will shortly determine allocations to individual authorities for the multi-annual housing programme and I will take the results of the assessment into consideration. The early notification of the multi-annual allocations will enable authorities to produce a streamlined delivery of housing output over the next four years and provide a better and more effective mechanism of social housing delivery.</P>
      <P>I expect that the local authority housing programme, together with the output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable the housing needs of up to 10,000 households to be catered for in 1999 and that the increased social housing output over the next four years will meet the needs of more than 50,000 households.</P>

      <P>Do I understand correctly from the Minister's figures that between the 39,000 households on the list and the 6,000 for whom other measures are prescribed, there are 45,000 applicants in need of housing? Second, I put it to the Minister that the housing programme he has just indicated over a four year period will do no more than house half of that number. Third, since this assessment was carried out six months ago, housing lists have grown by between 20 per cent and 25 per cent in most local authority areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might wait until we produce the policy document. However, I wish to clarify the position in regard to the moratorium, which I have done previously. Prior to the last general election, we had a policy document which called for a moratorium on the deliberate release of GMOs. I have said previously that when I became Minister it was one of the first things that I tried to pursue, but I was advised strongly within the Department and by the Attorney General that it was not, and is not, possible to impose such a moratorium because of EU law.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I set up the national consultation debate on GMOs and the environment. That process is complete and will provide the basis for our policy document. The Deputy will be aware that an independent panel, comprising four people, listened to both sides of the debate and it has made recommendations, which, by and large, we have accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many international studies have been undertaken in relation to the incineration and thermal treatment of waste and considerable information in this regard is available through ENFO, the environmental information service operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>During 1998, two EU funded feasibility studies were carried out in Ireland on thermal treatment/recovery options as one element in an integrated approach towards the management of wastes. These studies examined the technical, environmental, financial and social advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment in two distinct rural regions &ndash; the north-east and mid-west &ndash; and in the greater Dublin region. The studies concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that waste combustion with energy recovery is a safe, tried and tested technology capable of meeting stringent environmental standards. They were undertaken to assist in informing the development and implementation of waste management plans by the local authorities in the regions concerned.</P>
      <P>Waste to energy incineration, carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, is regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries and further afield. Where technically and economically feasible, and subject to appropriate attention to materials recycling, incineration with energy recovery or other advanced thermal processes are among the treatment options which should be considered in an integrated waste management strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the integrated licensing and comprehensive environmental control of waste incineration facilities. High standards of environmental protection are applied in the context of licensing such facilities. The Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; is precluded from granting an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the <Col N="818" /> environment. At present, the agency has granted IPC licences in respect of ten hazardous and clinical waste incineration facilities.</P>

Are there any plans within the Department to utilise Objective One funding or funding under the new national plan to assist in building a structure to deal with that? An application has been made to Europe under the fifth programme for a licence. Is the Minister prepared to support that initiative which would deal with the serious situation which exists in the area, not just from an environmental point of view but also from a tourism point of view? The situation is also stalling the further extension of production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem in the Cavan-Monaghan area to which the Deputy refers. It is my understanding that the feasibility study for the north-east, which included Cavan-Monaghan, Louth and Meath, took this problem into account. Deliberations focused on the most feasible type of treatment of waste in the region. The particular problem to which the Deputy refers was given a great deal of consideration before any final recommendation was made.</P>
      <P>The Department is not directly responsible for the provision of these facilities. The regional authorities or local authorities in a region will make the final decision on waste management strategies and plans. It will be up to them to decide what mix of solutions will be utilised for waste management in their areas.

      <Quest>the provisions, if any, he has made for the disposal of sludge from waste water treatment plants in view of the fact that the EU landfill directive will prohibit the disposal of such sludge on landfill sites.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18764/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997 my Department appointed consultants to undertake additional work in the area of sludge management with the principal aim of refining existing policy in relation to the re-use of treated sludge and to provide a methodology for local authorities to prepare and implement sludge management plans. This policy had identified that the least desirable disposal method was landfilling and reflects the direction taken in the landfill directive which imposes strict conditions on, though does not prohibit, the disposal of sewage sludge to landfill. In June of this year, the resulting guidance document for the preparation of sludge management plans and a model plan were issued to county councils and county boroughs by my Department with an instruction to them to press ahead with the preparation of county, or if more appropriate, regional sludge management plans. Copies of these documents are available in the Oireachtas Library. Work is being finalised on the preparation of a code of practice for re-use of the treated sludge on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has also recently awarded the sludge disposal contract for sludge arising from the Ringsend treatment plant. As a consequence, dumping of sewage sludge at sea from Ringsend has now ceased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the new, stricter regulations come into force? I understood that sewage sludge was to be prohibited from landfill disposal. Are provisions in place to ensure that sludge does not get into the food chain? I would be concerned about land spreading. We have witnessed scares <Col N="820" /> in Europe recently. Will safeguards be put in place to ensure the security of our food supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The landfill directive imposes very strict conditions on the disposal of sewage sludge to landfill although it does not prohibit it. It is still an option, though not the optimum one. A sludge strategy study was carried out in 1993 at which time the Department asked local authorities to commence the groundwork for the preparation of sludge management plans either by themselves or on a regional basis. In the Waste Management Act, 1996, there was also a requirement of local authorities, within their waste management plans, to deal with the issue of sludge. The guidance document for the preparation of sludge management plans, which I mentioned, was an effort by the Department to provide more detailed guidance to local authorities on the preparation of plans and to specify the parameters and the issues to be taken into account in their preparation. It is my understanding that all the regions and local authorities will probably have their waste management plans in place and decided by the end of this year. Sludge management will form part of those general waste management plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is acceptable environmentally and healthwise. International practice supports the land-spreading of bio-solids, which is a waste water treatment derived sludge and can be beneficially recycled. With regard to the preparation of the sludge management plans, we have outlined a model plan based on the circumstances that might apply in particular counties and we are giving that information to the local authorities. A code of good practice is in place for the use of bio-solids. Deputies may have seen an article in one of last Saturday's newspapers relating to the £200 million sewage treatment plant. Spreading sludge on land is acceptable if it is properly treated and with these documents and the guidance given, we are trying to ensure that it will be properly treated and used properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 66 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 139 of 2 February 1999 and 31, 55 and 102 of 3 March 1999 in which I indicated that I was not lobbied directly by the US National Security Adviser, Mr. Sander Berger, in relation to genetically modified crops. However, during the Taoiseach's visit to the United States in March 1998 the issue of Ireland's attitude to genetically modified products on the EU market was raised in the margins of unrelated meetings by members of the US administration, including Mr. Berger. This was conveyed to me by the Taoiseach's office in the context of Ireland's position on four marketing proposals which were considered at a meeting of EU member states on 18 March 1999.</P>
      <P>I was not personally lobbied by representatives of any other Governments or by any commercial interests in connection with these four votes. However, a letter from the Canadian embassy to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in relation to one of the proposals, a genetically modified oilseed rape product, was passed on to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the reply of 3 March 1999 I also placed on the record of the House my meeting in Dublin with the US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Richard Rominger, on 26 March 1998 during which the issue of Ireland's position on the marketing notifications was also raised. This meeting was a courtesy call on foot of a request from the United States in the course of a short visit to this country by Mr. Rominger and his wife. We discussed developments in genetic engineering, <Col N="822" /> particularly in relation to environmental considerations. We did not discuss genetically modified foods specifically, as responsibility for legislation in this area rests with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>With regard to the four marketing notifications on which member states were invited to vote at the meeting on 18 March 1999, three related to genetically modified maize products and one to a herbicide tolerant oilseed rape product. The four notifications had been referred by the European Commission to the relevant EU scientific committees and there was no reason to believe that they would cause any adverse effects on human health or the environment. All four notifications received qualified majority support and marketing consent was approved. Ireland supported only one of the maize products, sponsored by AgroEvo France, and abstained on the other three. While Ireland had not previously voted to approve the release of a genetically modified maize product, we previously voted in favour of a number of other genetically modified products, including soya beans, chicory and oilseed rape. At the March 1998 vote my overall preference was to abstain in individual votes pending the completion of the national consultation process. However, in the case in question, particularly in view of the advice from the EU scientific committees, I took the view that it would be inappropriate that this preference should affect the wider Community position. Ireland was represented at the meeting by an official of my Department who acted on my instructions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the date on which the discussions took place between Mr. Berger and the Taoiseach was 17 March 1998, the day before the EU meeting on 18 March? Did the message conveyed to him from the Taoiseach's Department before the meeting on 18 March relate specifically to the maize plant in favour of which Ireland voted? On the Minister's statement that Ireland's voting position was taken on his direct instructions, did he instruct his officials attending the meeting to vote in favour of the maize plant to which he referred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that the discussion took place on or around 17 March. I do not have an exact date but I presume it took place on St. Patrick's Day, during the Taoiseach's visit to the United States in March 1998. The message I received did not refer to the specific product for which Ireland voted. It was a general message relating to the votes in the European Union and the importance that was attached to them. What was the Deputy's third question?</P>

      <P>This was not the first time Ireland voted approval for GMO products. Ireland voted to approve such products in 11 cases since 1991. We voted against approval in four cases and we abstained in five cases. The five cases in which we abstained were ones in which I was involved directly. There were approximately 20 cases and we voted for approval in 11 cases. The vote took place, if I recall rightly, on 18 March which was after I had a conversation with someone from the Taoiseach's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean this as a smart answer, but whether a person votes for something, against it or abstains, has an effect on the outcome. I have replied to the question I was asked. The only contact I had with Mr. Rominger was when he visited here on the 26th, a week after the vote took place in Europe. He was anxious to point out the importance of GM foods to the economy of the US and I was equally anxious to point out the serious concerns people of Ireland and of other members states of Europe had in relation to genetically modified foods. One could say the result of the meeting we had was that we agreed to disagree on the issue overall during the course of that conversation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question was put down before the issue of the planning guidelines on residential density in final form on Tuesday, 28 September, I assume the question is inquiring as to the difference between my Department's circular letter PD 4/98 on residential density, which issued on 15 May 1998, and the draft planning guidelines on residential density, which were issued for public consultation on 2 March 1999.</P>

      <P>Very shrewd, Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines on residential density were not issued by my Department prior to the issue of circular letter PD 4/98, which issued on foot of a recommendation contained in the first Bacon report, An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments. The circular letter, in a general way, provided advice to planning authorities in relation to promoting increased densities in appropriate locations, the safeguards required and the steps that should be taken, pending the preparation of detailed plan<Col N="825" /> ning guidelines on residential density by my Department.</P>
      <P>The draft planning guidelines on residential density, which issued in March 1999, set out in a detailed manner the locations appropriate for higher residential densities, the range of densities appropriate to various locations and the need to achieve a high quality of residential environment. For example, in relation to outer suburban greenfield sites, the guidelines recommend that development at densities of less than 20 dwellings per hectare &ndash; eight per acre &ndash; should generally be discouraged. On greenfield lands, which are proximate to existing or proposed public transport corridors, densities in excess of 50 dwellings per hectare &ndash; 20 per acre &ndash; are recommended.</P>
      <P>The draft guidelines, which were issued for public consultation, received general support. All comments received were considered in full in preparing the final guidelines. Most of the changes in the final guidelines are changes of emphasis or points of clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given all the qualifications the Minister has attached to the status and effect of these guidelines, will he agree that the guidelines, as they currently extend, do not refer to the issue of noise insulation, which is likely to be an important factor in higher density residential developments? Will he also agree that if these guidelines are to be put into practice, they will have to be accompanied by far more substantial measures than are currently in force to assist in good estate management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines deal with the density of dwellings per acre, not the density of the walls of those dwellings, which will be dealt with under the technical guidance documents and the building regulations. This point in relation to noise was raised previously and it will have to be taken on board in the new guidelines.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the Education (Welfare) Bill for the attention of this House. The Bill has been drafted to address the needs of those most at risk of suffering educational disadvantage. It represents a radical but necessary departure from the traditional approach to the problem of non-attendance. In a major new initiative, it proposes to put in place a supportive infrastructure to help every element of the system to make its own contribution to tackling school attendance difficulties.</P>
      <P>This Bill was initiated in the other House and has already been the subject of much constructive discussion there. A number of amendments have been made to the Bill on foot of that discussion. Since those discussions, the Minister and officials of the Department have continued an intensive process of consultation with the partners in education and, as recently as last week, the Minister attended a major consultative seminar on the Bill. The seminar brought together a wide range of individuals and groups concerned with school attendance and with the implementation of the Bill. All these consultations have proved immensely useful and have informed a number of amendments which we will be proposing on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> I would like, for the benefit of the House, to explain why this is both timely and necessary legislation. I would then like to outline some of the key provisions of the Bill. The Bill has two broad aims. First, it provides for greater clarity and certainty as regards each child's right to a minimum education, the right of parents to choose how that education is to be provided and the State's role in providing for an education for each child. Second, the Bill provides a structure to encourage and promote school attendance, up to leaving certificate level or its equivalent, and by so doing to give our students a solid educational basis for later life. I would like to consider each of those objectives.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution sets out a number of broad principles which underpin our education system. These principles strike a fine balance between the rights and duties of children, parents and the State. Deputies will appreciate that the Minister must work within this structure in framing legislation in this most important area. The legislation drafted must respect the balance between the rights of all the participants.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be familiar with the detail of these constitutional provisions. Of particular relevance here are the provisions relating to the role of the family as &ldquo;the primary and natural educator of the child&rdquo;, the State's guarantee &ldquo;to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children&rdquo;&ndash; Article 42.1 &ndash; and the right of parents &ldquo;to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State&rdquo;&ndash; Article 42.2. These provisions recognise the right of parents to educate their children while, at the same time, requiring the State &ldquo;as guardian of the common good, to require, in view of actual conditions, that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social&rdquo;&ndash; Article 42.3.2.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill has been drafted to reflect and respect these rights in a balanced and proportionate way. The starting point when considering rights is the right of the child to an education. Parents, too, have rights to determine the education of their children and the Bill protects those rights. It explicitly recognises that some parents will opt to have their children educated outside the recognised school system.</P>
    <P>The Bill must also take account of the Minister's duty to ensure that all children receive a minimum education. The Education Welfare Board, which I will discuss in more detail presently and which will be established in accordance with this Bill, will play a key role in this regard, in particular in so far as children receiving education outside the recognised school system are concerned. I accept that many dedicated parents provide a very high level of education to their children outside the school system. The Bill does not interfere with their rights in this regard. <Col N="840" /> However, when parents cannot provide a minimum education the board may have to intervene to secure the child's right to a minimum education. In these cases the board may require the parents of the child to comply with certain conditions to ensure that the child does receive a minimum education for the future. Alternatively, if the case warrants it, the board may ultimately require the parent to enrol the child at a recognised school.</P>
    <P>Let me be absolutely clear &ndash; the intention throughout is to respect the legitimate rights of parents in the education of their children. Deputies will appreciate that this is a delicate and sensitive area. Yet, it is also of fundamental importance that each child is given the educational opportunities to which he or she is entitled. I am firmly of the view that the legislation, as drafted, provides an appropriate and fair balance between the rights of all concerned, and respects each individual's constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to provide a structure to encourage and promote school attendance and, by so doing, to give our students a solid educational basis in later life. I know that Deputies will be aware of the strong evidence of a very close link between poor school attendance and social and economic disadvantage in later life. It has been shown that 90 per cent of households classified as poor are headed by an early school leaver and that people with low educational qualifications have less chances of employment than people with higher educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>The ESRI, in its identification of the national investment priorities for 2000 to 2006, also noted that research has found that the absence of any educational qualifications among many school leavers leaves them seriously at risk of spending much of their lives unemployed. The ESRI also warned that despite our economic success, those people who leave the educational system without qualifications will remain at a significant disadvantage in finding employment. They highlighted interventions for children who are currently not making it through the system as the first priority for investment in education over the period of the next national development plan.</P>
    <P>Over 10,000 teenagers each year leave the education system without any qualifications. We have said repeatedly that we must target interventions towards this group and in line with this the Government has launched a number of policy initiatives in this area over the last two years. These initiatives include the vital importance of linking families to schools, which has been recognised through the extension of the home school liaison service to every school classified as disadvantaged; special education needs, which have been targeted through the introduction of a needs-based system of supports and the extension of the remedial teaching service to every school <Col N="841" /> in the country, and the establishment of a new national educational psychological service which is already well under way.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently launched a £4.5 million stay in school initiative, aimed at keeping pupils in school to the end of the leaving certificate, through school-based plans, supported by generous financing.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister of State as it is not my intention to interrupt him. However, if his speech is to include statistical matter, it is important that we would have copies of it before we make our own contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have no control over this matter. My understanding was that copies would have been circulated by now. I agree with Deputy Higgins and fully accept his point but, unfortunately, there is nothing I can do here and now to secure his wishes.</P>
      <P>These new programmes are additional to a number of well established programmes which have the aim of retaining children and young people in the education system for sufficiently long to enable them to benefit to the maximum extent from the system. On the curriculum and programme side considerable progress has been made in curriculum developments at both first and second level. In the last month, the Minister launched the revised primary curriculum. We have also significantly expanded the resources allocated to the leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programme and the junior certificate schools programme.</P>
      <P>These changes need to be underpinned by a strong, up-to-date legislative framework. The current legislative framework for the administration of school attendance is still provided largely by the School Attendance Act, 1926. This Act, which reflects the era and environment in which it was drafted and enacted, is of limited usefulness in tackling the complex problems which we currently face in relation to school attendance. The Act was, essentially, a relatively simplistic mechanism to deal with what, at that time, appeared to be a very simple problem. Moreover, the Act was framed negatively, rather than positively. It focused on punishing offenders, rather than assessing the causes of school non-attendance with a view to tackling them. Finally, the Act expected schools and principals to take on the full brunt of promoting school attendance without adequately providing for the duty of the State to support schools in these endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is framed to provide for a completely new and structured approach to school attendance issues. The Bill recognises the complexity of the issues surrounding and determining school non-attendance and early school leaving, takes a proactive rather than reactive approach to deal with these issues and, in particular, creates a radical new support mechanism for children. The Bill also seeks to promote positive attitudes to school <Col N="842" /> attendance, rather than merely to sanction poor school attendance. In support of the changed focus, the Bill contains a number of specific positive elements, which combine to form an integrated and holistic approach to promoting school attendance. These include, for example, school attendance strategies which each school must prepare with the objective of promoting school attendance among pupils. Each school must also prepare a code of behaviour setting out the behaviour expected of pupils at that particular school.</P>
    <P>The aim throughout is to encourage young people to remain in the education system so that they may benefit as much as possible from the system and lay a solid foundation for future successful participation in their social and economic development and that of their community.</P>
    <P>The Bill must obviously contain provisions for tracking children through the education system, to stem the tide of children who simply disappear each year from the system. It must also contain provision for record keeping by schools and by others involved in the education system. I am aware that some groups have questioned the rationale for the record-keeping system proposed in place in the Bill. They have suggested that this will place too great an imposition on schools and unwarranted demands on their time, which will disrupt the normal operation of those schools. I want to take a moment to deal with that specific criticism. The existing framework for the administration of school attendance is contained in the School Attendance Act, 1926. This Act makes specific provision for a record-keeping system in each school. Each school principal must, according to section 15 of the Act:</P>
    <P>supply on demand in the prescribed form to any enforcing authority, the respective ages as stated in the school registers of all or any of the children attending such school and the prescribed particulars of the attendance at and absences from such school of all or any of those children who are children to whom this Act applies.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the limited school attendance service, no dedicated supports are currently provided to assist schools in tackling school non-attendance and promoting school attendance. I know that, today, most schools engage in effective recording of pupils' attendance and non-attendance, of monitoring individual absences and requiring consequent explanations, and of noting any longer-term patterns which indicate possible school attendance problems.</P>
    <P>The new legislation reflects this and, at the same time, updates the existing requirements already set out in the 1926 Act. However, unlike the earlier legislation, the new Bill introduces a radical new structure in the form of the national educational welfare board to, for the first time ever, provide dedicated support to schools to <Col N="843" /> combat the wider issues surrounding school non-attendance.</P>
    <P>Let me be clear. The Government considers that this legislation is among the most important which will be introduced in the area of education.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes to the heart of our commitments to enhance the life chances of all children through education. It does not seek to, nor do I believe does it, place a serious additional workload on schools in relation to this core educational objective. That is not to say that it does not have any resource implications. There are schools which experience significant levels of absenteeism and it is our intention that additional resources will be concentrated on them, through existing programmes and through future development of these and other programmes in the future.</P>
    <P>More generally, the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board will provide a supportive framework to assist schools and minimise the impact of compliance with the Bill's provisions. This is a very innovative development which I feel sure will be of considerable support to schools in the future.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the Bill will result in excessive reporting of trivial school attendance problems to the educational welfare officers. That is not the position. In the majority of instances, schools will deal with non-attendance at a local level. It is not the concern of this Bill, nor should it be, to deal with a child who misses three or four school days over the course of the school year. Such an event could quite conceivably occur in the case of many pupils. However, the Bill must make provision for the Minister to fulfil his duty to ensure that every child's right to a minimum education is vindicated. That is the sole aim of the record keeping and reporting proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As already stated, it is generally accepted, and supported by research, that there is a strong relationship between the amount of time a person spends in education and that person's ability to participate successfully in the economy and in society generally. The current school leaving age is 15; the legislation will raise this age to 16, with a capacity to change this in the future by order with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas if circumstances warrant it. It is clear, however, that it is not simply the period of time which is spent in the education system that determines future life chances. Some solid educational achievements must be gained if students are to be able to take their places in the economy and in society. Conscious of this, we have chosen to extend the duration of schooling in a constructive and innovative manner. Thus, the new requirement is not simply a blunt statement of a raised school leaving age; rather it is a statement that, in order to leave school, a student must both have reached the age of 16 and completed three years of post-primary education. A core element of supporting this extended period in school is the <Col N="844" /> expansion of curriculum options which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern that young people should benefit to the maximum extent from the education system does not stop when they reach school leaving age. We have made no secret of the fact that we are concerned to ensure that young people should continue to benefit from the education system until the age of 18 and beyond. This is why the Bill makes specific provision for young people aged 16 to 18 years who have left the education system. In dealing with this issue we have, again, sought to take an even handed approach. I am aware that many young people will wish to leave school as soon as possible to take up employment. I am also aware that, in many cases, this can be a challenging and rewarding step with the potential for career progression and mobility within the labour force. Many of the young people involved may, in fact, continue their education at a later stage through the many opportunities for second chance and adult education supported by my Department. However, I am also aware that in too many instances this can be a move into low pay, low skills jobs, with little prospect of progression in the future. Too often this first step into the labour force can keep young people in cycles of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to tackle this issue, the Bill will provide for a reinforcement of the provisions of the Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. The Bill will, however, go further. It will seek to ensure that young people who leave the mainstream education system will have an opportunity to continue their education while at the same time being in a position to take up paid employment. This is a radical and innovative concept which aims to provide a solution to the competing demands of short-term return against investment for longer-term success. The Bill, as drafted, makes certain provisions in this regard. However, it has been pointed out to me that the current draft, although its principles are widely supported, is deficient in some respects. The Minister has already indicated his intention to reconsider its provisions with a view addressing these matters. He proposes to introduce an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the most innovative elements of this Bill will be the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board. As I mentioned earlier, the board will play a key role in ensuring that each child receives a minimum education and will support and assist schools in promoting school attendance. This is a wholly new support mechanism for schools in an area where previously schools had, for the most part, been left to confront these issues alone.</P>
    <P>Non-school attendance and early school leaving is not simply an educational problem; it is usually a symptom of more wide ranging difficulties in a variety of areas, which cannot be addressed through the education system alone. Rather, the problem of non-school attendance must be <Col N="845" /> addressed in a multidisciplinary manner with the involvement of experts in a range of areas. This is reflected in the current draft of the Bill which makes provision for formal liaison between the board and a variety of agencies with expertise in the school attendance area.</P>
    <P>The current draft of the Bill also makes provision for the membership of the board to be decided following consultation with the main Ministers with responsibility in this and related areas. Finally, to ensure that the views of all concerned are reflected in the work of the board, the Bill makes further provision for the establishment of a committee, representative of the partners in education, to advise the board in relation to its functions. Some groups have argued that the membership of the board should include representatives of those involved in tackling school attendance issues on the ground, that is, in schools. It is the Minister's intention that all members of the board should have a deep insight into and awareness of the education system. He is also concerned to ensure that the membership of the board should not be so large as to inhibit it in carrying out its functions. However, the Minister has listened to the views expressed and we are considering whether we can expand the proposed membership of the board without interfering with the core principles of its being small and expert.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Welfare Board will carry out many of its functions through educational welfare officers. Our intention, in line with the changed focus since the 1926 Act, is that the educational welfare officers will act mainly in a positive, supportive role to children and schools. While the officers will obviously retain a role in relation to offences under the legislation, their focus, however, will be on assisting children, parents and schools to ensure that children receive their entitlement to a minimum education, whether inside or outside the formal school system.</P>
    <P>Particular roles which the educational welfare officers will play, under the aegis of the board, include assessing the education provided to children educated outside the mainstream school system; assisting schools in tracking students who stop attending one school but fail to register at another; assisting schools in dealing with problems of poor school attendance on the part of individual children; assisting schools in developing school attendance strategies and codes of behaviour, in line with guidelines to be developed by the board; where it proves impossible to enrol a child in a school, making arrangements to ensure that the child receives a prescribed minimum education and supporting young people who have left the mainstream school system in continuing their education.</P>
    <P>One of the main deficiencies in the present system is that school attendance officers are located only in a relatively small number of areas throughout the country. It is our intention, ultimately, to extend the system of educational wel<Col N="846" /> fare officers nationwide. While I appreciate that this objective may take some time to achieve, departmental officials have already begun to plan for the development and expansion of the service. This planning process will include consideration of the resource needs of the new system, as well as the training and development needs of existing school attendance officers who will transfer to the new system, and of new recruits to the service. It is important to realise that the service will not and should not be the same in all areas. It will obviously vary in its coverage depending on the extent of the non-attendance problem evident in the area. There will be no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach which would undermine the board's ability to effectively target its resources.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill sets out a somewhat adversarial role for the educational welfare officers <i>vis-à-vis</i> schools. Some schools would appear to be concerned that the new role envisaged for the officers might cause difficulties for them. This is not the intention. Rather, as I said earlier, it is intended that educational welfare officers will have as their main aim the support of children, their parents and the schools in ensuring that every child benefits to the maximum extent possible from the education system.</P>
    <P>I believe this is an important Bill which represents a new departure for school attendance policies in this country. I look forward to the constructive debate which I know will take place in this House.</P>
    <P>For his part the Minister has already said, and he asked me to repeat it here today, that he intends approaching discussions on Committee Stage in a positive and open-minded manner. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the last statement of the Minister. I hope a constructive approach will be taken to the Bill because it has fallen dramatically far short of what we would have expected in the most serious educational issue facing the State. Early school leaving is a serious problem. As many as one in six leaves school early. That corresponds closely to the figures, of which the Minister is well aware, which indicate that among 16 to 25 year olds, one in six is leaving school at the most basic level of literacy where functionally he or she is not capable of reading the back of an aspirin package. We have a serious problem that affects at least one in six of our student population and the Minister of State's contribution was studded with phrases like &ldquo;eventually we will do something although this will be a long time away&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is not to say that this Bill does not have resource implications&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about this issue it must have very serious resource implications. There is no point in creating a structure of this nature if resources are not allocated to help schools and individual pupils who have attendance problems. We know from studies in many deprived parts of <Col N="847" /> this city that as many as one in four pupils have serious problems that leave them absent from school for long periods. There is need for a much more radical approach to the needs of those schools and those pupils than is evident in the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In many ways this Bill is a move forward from the School Attendance Act. It recognises the much wider canvas on which issues must be addressed but it does not deliver the type of change we expected. That is why on Committee Stage, and right through the passage of the Bill, we will seek firm legal commitments to children who, for one reason or another, are being failed by our education system. As the debate goes on, it will not be good enough just to talk about resources becoming available in the long-term because, as John Maynard Keynes said, in the long-term we are all dead. The danger we face is that the long-term will be too long for many of our young people.</P>
    <P>We must remember the history of the Bill. It is the successor to the School Attendance Act of 1926 and the Department is culpable for its failure to deliver on that Act. That Act has fallen into total disuse. The Department has no idea of the level of absenteeism occurring in schools throughout the country. Despite its legal obligation under the 1926 Act to obtain that information from schools, it has consistently refused to do so. The Bill requires an enormous act of faith from pupils and those in the education system who are grappling with the issue of early school leaving, but history will record that such an act of faith is not worth making because when the Department previously produced legislation in this area, it manifestly failed to deliver on its obligations. There are issues about resourcing that we have to face up to and those issues were not addressed in the Minister of State's contribution.</P>
    <P>I have some misgivings about the whole approach to the school attendance and early school leaving issue and about creating a special agency to deal with it. It is a dangerous precedent to create a legislative structure where school attendance issues are different from school development issues. It runs the risk of perpetuating the marginalisation of people who are being served by this agency. It sends the message to schools that to deal with poor attenders requires a separate strategy, that it is not the mainstream concern of the school. The school should be all about the needs of that one in six, not having the notion of a separate strategy that has to be pulled together and sent off to this new agency. Facing up to the needs of those potential early school leavers should be integral to a school.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in its new manifestation the whole concept of regional education boards is now gone from the Bill. In its previous manifestation school attendance issues were put at the heart of a regional education strategy. It was an holistic approach by the State interfacing with the <Col N="848" /> school. Early school leaving and school attendance issues were part of the strategy of schools but this Bill creates its own agency with its own demands on schools. As the Minister said in his contribution, it will be the concern of some schools but not of others and that is a danger in the strategy behind the thinking in the Bill. Examining the issue of early school leaving should be central to a school plan. It is about the Department entering into a partnership with those schools to resource them to face those problems, not to tell them to fill out forms and send them off to some agency.</P>
    <P>Much of this appears to come from the Minister's preoccupation with maintaining centralism in the Department, his rejection of regionalisation or any sort of local education boards. He has the notion that there will be turf boundaries where school attendance will be an issue in certain areas and that there will be some other curriculum in others. That is not the way the interface with schools should occur. This national structure is not particularly well attuned to deal with an intensively local and community based issue &ndash; the issue of why children do not attend or drop out of school early. Much of it is to do with the environment and the support available in those communities. There is something a bit bizarre about lengthy sections in the Bill being given over to creating a liaison structure between 49 different specified bodies. The concept of integrated delivery is a very firm concept at the level of a family but the Minister is trying to create some sort of top-down integration where 49 different bodies will liaise with people. God knows what sort of talking shop will emerge from all of that.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the delivery to families. I am deeply sceptical about that and about the notion of 4,000 schools submitting their plans to an individual national agency. What will the agency do as these 4,000 plans come cascading into its offices by some due date? The attention given to them will be extremely suspect.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, the Bill has not offered any place for those people in the area based partnerships and the different community initiatives who have been trying to create initiatives to support early school leavers. Where is their role in this new approach to school attendance issues? They are not mentioned in the Bill. They are not given any recognition. There is not any local structure of which they will be a part and how they interface with this new structure is not mentioned. This represents a major weakness in the Bill and it betrays a problem at the heart of the Department. It is thinking centrally. The Minister said it will not be a case of &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo;, but the Department always thinks in terms of central models and expects the local community to fit into them. That thinking is antiquated.</P>
    <P>The biggest challenge facing the Bill is how to ensure a prescribed minimum education for every child. We all want to do that. We do not want early school leavers with literacy problems, but <Col N="849" /> the Bill is remarkably silent on that issue. What is it going to do about it apart from the record-keeping? Section 10 admittedly spells out some interesting and worthwhile functions, but they are extremely remote from delivering to the individual, family or school facing problems. Section 10 refers to conducting research, assessing strategies and advising on curriculum and teacher training and these are all worthwhile, but I want to see a framework within which the education welfare officers can work in partnership with communities and deliver services to children who will otherwise fall out of the school system. That is not mentioned in the Bill &ndash; there is no section dealing with what the education welfare officer will do when he or she finds a child who is persistently failing to attend. This is a hopeless gap in the Bill and it is hard to conceive how the Bill got through drafting without someone asking &ldquo;When we have the early warning bells and the red lights are flashing, what are we going to do about it?&rdquo;  What are the welfare officers going to do? The Bill does not say what they are going to do and we must spell that out in statute.</P>
    <P>There is no point in making the act of faith we have made with the 1926 Act, because it did not happen, so to speak. There is no point saying that education welfare officers are great people. They are great people &ndash; they struggle without resources and they will continue to struggle without resources until we write into the Bill what is expected of them and the level of resources that will be necessary to deliver it.</P>
    <P>The framework that has been developed is all about statutory duties that are almost exclusively put upon the schools and the parents. The school will have to inform the education welfare officer and the officer will have to serve notices on parents. These are the obligations involved, but where is the supportive action in the Bill? There is no indication of the support that will be available to help schools and children to deal with this. The craziest element of all is that the only point where the Bill starts to address what is to be done with children in this situation refers to when the child has been expelled &ndash; when the child has irrevocably severed all ties with the school system and is out on the street with nowhere to go. It is then that the Education (Welfare) Bill takes on a role. It will then look at finding an alternative to education for them and if they are over 15 it will look at personal education plans. That is far too late.</P>
    <P>There is no point waiting until the latent problem has become a crisis or goes beyond crisis point and the child is alienated and out of the system. It will probably be very difficult to retrieve such a child back into education. It is far too late then and if we want to make an impact with this Bill, we must talk about the early warning system and the response that follows on from that. The statute deals with this as a problem for the schools and once there is an early warning system the schools must do something about it. The schools must have a strategy and must have <Col N="850" /> it packed off in an envelope to the agency by the due date, but that will not do. We need a statutory framework stating what will be done to help the child who leaves school early, no matter what the reason. That is one amendment I will table.</P>
    <P>We should have a framework of practical support for schools &ndash; personal plans, case conferences, referrals to appropriate agencies that can help and budgets for innovation within the school for particular initiatives. There should be budgets for out-of-school agencies to support the needs of early school leavers, which is happening in many communities. There should be programmes to deliver support for primary-secondary transition, which is where many attendance problems emerge. There should be practical funding of integrated initiatives across the agencies that the Minister is trying to bring together. The Bill shows no appreciation of the partnership approach at local level that is needed to do something about this issue and that is the fatal flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The approach to transition to employment also reveals a very narrow concept of the needs of the early school leaver. For someone who has dropped out of school, taking up work will involve registration and certification and the employer will have to verify, on pain of committing a criminal offence, that certificates are present. That may be an excessive superstructure to impose, but the main question is what happens to children who are in school and who may be working until 2 or 3 a.m.? They come to school the following day like zombies. They learn nothing and this Bill will do nothing about that. This is a real problem and the Minister of State will know as well as I do that there are two officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment charged with inspecting children's working hours, but they only work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. There is no chance to deal with the problems of those whose work is interfering with their schooling. That is the concern &ndash; it is not about children who become alienated with the structure and look for work. We must support them in work.</P>
    <P>The registration may be excessive but why is employment being allowed to interfere with their schooling? I am a strong supporter of paying children, if necessary, to stay on in school rather than doing late night nixers and I have said so in the past. I am impressed with the experiment in Clondalkin, where a contract is made with pupils who stay on, do their homework and attend their classes diligently. That is having an impact and it would be much more practical than many other developments.</P>
    <P>I like the idea of a personal plan for young people who are out of school and searching for work, but again the statutory right to such a service is notably absent from the Bill. I would have thought a child centred Bill would have stated that a child out of school at 16 and looking for work had a right to certain services, such as a personal plan and support, but it is not there. The <Col N="851" /> board may do these things, but there is no right provided to the child. Given that 12,000 young people drop out of school each year, one is talking about 30,000 people from the outset who will need to have these personal education plans developed for them and the acid test will be in seeing whether there are resources for that to happen. There will be some scepticism about it.</P>
    <P>When publishing the Bill the Minister referred to new restrictions on employers. We do not want restrictions but we want to see amendments ensuring that employers are obliged to release people to train and to be involved in innovative partnerships between employers and educational training providers. We should not have further restrictions. We want to see further rights for the young people involved.</P>
    <P>Home educators see themselves as being wrongly included in the same section of this Bill as truants. The Minister will know from their correspondence with him of their many grievances. He does not plan to consult them on what a minimum education comprises and there are provisions for emotional assessments of children without parental consent and the observation of parents teaching, which are very intrusive by any standards. We must be conscious of striking a constitutional balance between the right of the parent as the natural educator and the right of the State to ensure a minimum standard is met. The model being quoted here is not the correct one. A better model operates in the Czech Republic, in which home educators register in the first instance with designated schools which provide support and liaison. It is the educator's obligation to register with a school and to provide progress reports on a regular basis, at least twice a year. The reports should include portfolios of work, standardised tests, and interviews with a person appointed by the school. This would ensure a standard is met. It is a localised relationship, where the parent has confidence in the school and has a great deal of discretion in what he or she does in the home. Only if that relationship breaks down will the intrusion of inspection arise; in other words, where adequate services were not being developed. There is much to be said for that and for having much stronger guidelines in the Bill as to how these new powers are to be used.</P>
    <P>There is a case for making amendments on Committee Stage to provide a more supportive environment for home education for those who choose it, while retaining the State's obligation not to allow a child's education opportunities fritter away if the home educator does not cut the mustard or has undertaken an obligation which he or she could not fulfil. We must tread carefully here but there is scope for a better drafting which would strike a fairer balance than the Bill does at present.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in the provision that where a child is expelled from school the education board will, for the first time, have a statu<Col N="852" /> tory obligation to provide a suitable alternative. Again, it is far too late to provide suitable alternatives after the child has left the school. There is much greater need for a safe retreat within the school, supported by the education welfare service, which might keep young people in the education system. That being said, it is right that the education welfare board should look to the alternatives when all else has failed and it is valuable that the board should have a statutory obligation to deliver such alternatives. What is surprising, however, is that these alternatives are not specified. This contrasts sharply with the provision for home educators, which mentions minimum standards. In this case the board, which is responsible for the minimum standards, becomes a provider in its own right and there is not any specification as to what the alternatives will be or a system for recognition of these alternatives.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister has Youthreach in mind in this case. I do not see why Youthreach cannot be given statutory recognition as an integral part of the services available to meet the needs of children who require education. Those who are in Youthreach would like their role to be recognised explicitly. They have always been the poor relation of education providers although in many ways they are dealing with the most challenging section of the education population. The schools have not been recognised as yet and do not have a clear remit or mandate, and this Bill is the ideal way to provide it. At some point we must deal with the conflict of interest between the obligation on the board to be a provider and also the invigilator of standards. It finds itself in the unusual position of having a legal obligation to provide education while also having to inspect and ensure a quality standard is being achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House, because it is on Committee Stage that we will deal with the substance of the Bill. It was drafted with the best of intentions in the Department but it has not sufficiently shaken off the shackles of the school attendance legislation. It is predominantly concerned with filling and collecting registers rather than delivering service to children at risk. That is the shift which must be made between now and the end of Committee Stage. The Bill needs a clear statement of commitment to serve the children affected, outlining what will happen when the early warning lights flash, what the board will do to help the schools in concrete terms, and what programmes we can expect to emerge from this. We do not need the legislation to spell out the chapter and verse, and it cannot do so, but it should contain the legal framework for developing those services. We have had the hard experience in that the Schools Attendance Act did not deliver &ndash; nothing came of it, albeit that it was in a narrow framework. We now have a structure which serves only a tiny proportion of our population, probably only one in six students has any education welfare service available to him or her. That is not going to change suddenly, it will be a long haul, according to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> He also spoke of minimum resource implications as a result of this Bill, but that will not do. We want this Bill to be genuinely child centred. If the State is to outline its obligations and commitments to children who leave early, why not give those young people and their parents a right of appeal, if they feel they are not getting appropriate placement or service? That seems to be foreign to the Minister and his drafters. He rejected it in the Education Act and does not provide for such mechanism here. I strongly support appointing an education ombudsman to whom people could apply if they felt they were not getting fair access to psychological assessment or other services. That idea is not supported in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My mark for the Bill would be &lsquo;five out of ten, more work needed'. However, I welcome the Minister's commitment, as his record shows, to see whether we can devise amendments on Committee Stage to broaden the Bill and meet the needs I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome those aspects of the Bill which seem to offer an opportunity to those I regard as lost children, those who are without an expectation of care and are vulnerable. However, it is curious that we should revise school attendance legislation 70 years after the introduction of a basic Act. Having said that, I will outline my attitude to the absent times in the preparatory stage of the legislation. There is a confusion in the Bill's assumptions concerning the nature of schooling and the distinction which must be made, if we are to take seriously legislation in this area, between schooling and education. Creativity is important to both, and central to the right of the child &ndash; referred to but indirectly in the Minister's speech &ndash; to develop his or her full personality in a creative way. This is not simply idealistic. It is important. Were I Minister for Education, I would have taken radical steps to advance such creativity, steps which some would have found difficult to accept. For example, beginning the school day in an atmosphere of tension, having had endless seminars about the problem of discipline, is much less useful than beginning it with music. If people begin the day in a state of relaxation, particularly younger children, the day can continue with information being imparted with greater success and unimpeded by stress. Everything should be derived from a fundamental and stated belief that creativity is defined socially rather than individually. This presumes one's need to manipulate symbols which are shared with others and are crucial to one's personal development. This should be a central aim of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have not heard the word &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; in any speech given by the Minister for Education and Science since he took office. Yes, I have great respect for his energy and the quantity and volume of it. There is, however, an enormous gap in its quality. There is an absence of <Col N="854" /> the &ldquo;vision thing&rdquo;, a cliché used by middle management and obviously, therefore, not a higher use of language. As regards this missing creativity, there seems to be an emphasis in the legislation on the delivery of children to school. The ones who have not been &ldquo;vacuumed up&rdquo; must be regulated to a point at which necessary distinctions are lost. I am moved by any Minister who makes proposals to include in the net of minimum education, a lost child on the street whose parents, relatives or those who have responsibility for the child do not have the capacity to look after him or her or whose own diminished capacity is being repeated inter-generationally. However, if one does that it is out of a duty of care. The points made by Deputy Bruton on linking other services to the wider reach of child provision are very important in this regard. In the 1926 Act, as is featured in a great deal of the literature, it was almost as if one was rounding up children &ndash; the attendance officers were at the corner and people ran and hid. There are many quasi-humorous accounts of that which are anything but humorous for the children in recollection.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that thinking has been abandoned in this Bill. For example, if that was the case, supposing I was entirely wrong and that a new and radical departure, as the Minister of State described it, was indeed being made, surely it would not have been beyond human intelligence to define minimum education. If one defined minimum education on the basis of the needs of the child, expressed creatively or whatever, this would lead to the automatic granting of recognition to forms of education which would not bring the Minister into collision with those who have the great opportunity &ndash; in some respects I envy them &ndash; of making provision for their children in what they feel are alternative spaces and forms to those which are available in a highly regulated and narrow setting.</P>
    <P>In Ireland in 1999 it may seem like heresy to say something else, the context of which I hope people will understand. As a spokesperson on education, I do not find it incumbent upon me to speak for ten minutes on how we have the finest education system in the world, followed by half an hour saying why we have the finest teachers in the world. I much prefer to get on with it. Our education system has some massive flaws. The huge number of people who leave school illiterate or innumerate is a reflection on the system. There is no other way of saying it. When people founder trying to make sense of this, they apparently blame everyone except the place where the alleged education is taking place and its personnel. This is a level of evasion which is absolutely intolerable. Frankly, we have some of the most wonderful teachers in the world and we also have some very seriously deficient teachers, for personal or other reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not like how in the education debate we can never get as far as what is happening in the school day. What happens in the school day? If I <Col N="855" /> mention, for example, what is being taught in one class period or another, I am referred to the curriculum review board and the group that is sitting on the teaching of this, that or the other. Then, when one is worn down with reading all the tomes there are still incredible problems with what is happening during the school day and in the school setting. Consultation with the partners in education is taking place in a glib manner &ndash; I know of many major exclusions. There are people who are interested in education whose opinions are never asked. There are many settings in education where the very last thing people want is a parent's opinion. Some outrageous decisions are taken as regards expulsion. Recently in my clinics I have been dealing with a range of children who have no options &ndash; for example, having made a mess of the leaving certificate they wish to repeat but are not accepted in their former school because they have a history of so-called disruption. I also know settings where a child with a bad name for disruption in year one must carry the burden of staff room prejudice through his or her schooling. There are no genuine appeal mechanisms as regards what a parent or child might say. There are no school councils which exist in so many European countries that would offer the student's opinion.</P>
    <P>Let me not be condemned as belonging to that band that rolls in behind the brass and reed saying &ldquo;the finest education system in the world &ndash; thump, thump, thump&rdquo;. There are many deficiencies in it. This raises the question of those who say they are asked to accept a regime in which people arrive at their door, seek entry and in circumstances that are not defined, not to speak of standards of minimum education which are not defined, they administer a test. They come back and ask to what scrutiny is the State subjected. I support the Minister of State, who has my whole-hearted support in his work on continuing education which includes some radical measures. I compliment him on that, but in mainstream education there are radical pro-child and pro-parent measures which are crying out to be implemented. We should not be asked to choose the advancement of the rights of the lost children, the children of the streets and those from incapable families at the cost of something else that is not causing a problem.</P>
    <P>For example, all the literature we have received on section 14 of the Bill could have been dispensed with, if an attempt was made to structure the Bill as an Education Bill by defining forms of education, the philosophy that lies behind it, its creative component and the various settings in which it may be attained. That would have meant that one would not be discussing, for example, the circumstances of those home educators who have taken the trouble to write to Deputies about truancy, which is an extraordinary concept anyway and pre-Roddy Doyle in its usage. It is an interesting word which is late Victorian in origin and has probably not been used among ordinary <Col N="856" /> people in Ireland since the 1920s. One would say one was &ldquo;mitching&rdquo; from school or whatever but one would have had a very rarefied existence to say &ldquo;I am a truant&rdquo;. People would wonder as to whether one was not already highly educated and on one's way to the races at the Curragh. I urge the Minister of State to look carefully at the way language is used in the Bill. The word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; occurs in the title and in at least one dozen sections. Why was such a word chosen rather than the word &ldquo;non-attendance&rdquo;? I will come back to this point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If there is a partnership, which seems to be much vaunted in our education system but whose better points I continually miss, then why not have a regime such as exists not just in the Czech Republic but also in Tasmania and many of the states of the United States where people could voluntarily register their alternative highly regulated options? One could then agree on a code of practice for the child. I am not defending that valuable kind of educational option at the cost of the children who are left with no option. I am horrified that in 1999 children are leaving school without qualifications or competencies in literacy and numeracy. I do not regret that because of the loss of economic benefit to themselves or their contribution to the economy but because of the loss to their personal development. I have met many young people who have been made to feel hopeless by a system that does not reach out to them or include them. I am sure many Deputies have met their parents at their clinics.</P>
    <P>A radical Minister for Education and Science might decide, for example, that every child born as a citizen is entitled to a body of rights or credits in education which they could combine and cash in at any time during their life from two to 82 years of age and that the purpose of educational provision, whether it is State, semi-State or private, is to enable them to combine their educational aspirations throughout their life. It is patently absurd that a person of 18 years of age may have lost their chance in formal education in relation to managing the transition from second to third level. I was a university teacher for 23 years and I was always of the opinion that people were too young going to third level education. I was familiar with and taught in systems where they went to third level education at an older age and in a better position to exercise intellectual choices. Why not make the system flexible? I support the Minister in addressing the issue of what he perceives to be the most vulnerable people who are lost to the system. My difficulty is he is not making critical the system to which he wants them restored.</P>
    <P>Many of the 10,000 children who leave school without qualifications have difficulties which have not been recognised. As regards the Department's history of recognising the needs of the dyslexic child or of those with other disorders, we, as spokespersons on education, have difficulty getting the Department to define what it regards as an educational disability. Many people have been <Col N="857" /> lost and brutalised by the system they have been through. The system must be looked at because everything is not rosy in this garden.</P>
    <P>In many cases a child whose parents are frequently told is disruptive, whose name is mentioned in the school staff room and who will be blackened for the rest of their life at the school is reacting to things which have nothing to do with pedagogical deficiency but to sarcasm and an inability to deal with the child's needs. I want to speak for these children whom I have met in my clinics. As a writer, I remember discussing with people reconstructions of their school days and the corrosive effect cynicism had on them and how it damaged their self-esteem. This must be critically reviewed within such a setting. There is no doubt that children in education today are probably influenced by the peer group rather than the family. The peer group is frequently violent, intolerant and rigid and has not taken its cultural forms from anything it learned in a gentle way from different generations but from the media. There are hidden cruelties within the system, both institutional and casual, which are important in the child's experience of life. I will deal with the other points made to me during representations on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have begun with a recognition of all educational options. It should have tested those educational options with the rights of the child regarding creativity as one of its central points. When I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I visited the Royal Hospital Kilmainham to view a display of children's work. When I asked a group of women from the north side of Dublin how often they got a letter from the school stating that their child might not be performing well academically but that he or she was a beautiful child in terms of their social skills and ability to laugh with others, they said they had not received one. In some parts of my constituency, where unemployment is 70 and 80 per cent, mothers have told me they get notes about every negative aspect of their child. Rearing children, sending them to school or deciding to educate them at home means making a significant sacrifice but it is an option which is available to few people. The hundreds of families who do so are making an incredible gesture towards the liberation and free activity of their children. However, we must also look after the thousands of children on the streets.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and Minister of State that the School Attendance Act, 1926, cannot handle the people who drop out of the system and who do not have the supports I described. It is important to begin by not saying that the school, uncriticised, is that to which we must relate. One will not get away without testing the school in terms of the quality of its experience throughout the day. When one has done that, one will be able to say what the child is missing. At the end of a leaving certificate year, after the big debate about whether people should drink Fanta or alcohol <Col N="858" /> and where they should go when the results are announced, dozens of children in every town and city who have not performed well slink back to their homes. One might say that VTOS and post-leaving certificate courses are available for these children. However, they are all totally under resourced and if the Bill works properly, none of those children should be lost. No child who performs badly in the leaving certificate should be abandoned, where the story they must tell at home is that they did not do well and they have disappointed their parents. Such children are often from homes where the parents are disappointed with their own expectations and have made a huge investment in their children. It is at this most vulnerable point that such a child cannot be regarded as an ex-pupil of the school. The successful ones will all be back, but such children will be around the place, standing outside bars, playing video machines or standing smoking cigarettes wondering what they should do with their lives. These are the circumstances where there is no connection between all the advice services available for the welfare of the child and guidance facilities within the school.</P>
    <P>The capital &ldquo;P&rdquo; should be removed from the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; and partnership made to work. There is a real need to listen to what parents are saying and to those who no longer have children in school but who remember their experiences. Perhaps one of the reasons I may never be the Minister for Education and Science and I have disqualified myself, is that I believe the changes which are needed are so radical, not only in terms of quantity and the reach of education, but in its content, quality and absence of flexibility. I do not suggest people are not doing wonderful things. I read about the changed way of teaching geography where people are brought to discover the origin of a river and to look at all the industrial history associated with the water. I applaud such changes but there is a real need to develop these creative innovations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the specific representations we received from those who provide an educational option for their children at home. Their point is fair. Their option is not another version of truancy. It is sad that they are driven to assert their constitutional rights to exercise an option which is legitimate in relation to the teaching of the child. They are also right to seek definitions where definitions are in danger of being used arbitrarily and without consultation in relation to the minima of education. The testing of a child who is receiving an alternative option in terms of intellectual, emotional or physical development cannot be handled in the way suggested in the Bill. I remember well, from a medical point of view, the terror with which the inspectors were regarded in the 1950s. The inspectors arrived to inspect the hygiene of children and it was a good threat to a child that he or she would be taken behind the board to be almost physically examined there and then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> I wish I could say that fear was gone from the educational system. Sadly, it is not gone and it has never been boldly and bravely rejected as a principle and something which defeats every principle of pedagogy and genuine education. It is as if this institution was obtained somewhere or another from the 19th century through many collusions with power interests, particularly those who ran the managerial system and who undemocratically called themselves patrons. However, they still have no constitutional or legal right to call themselves patrons except on the basis of what was once termed by the former Minister for Education, Mr. Cooney, as the principle of continuity. In other words, they had got away with it for ages and they should continue to get away with it. The whole point is that if one wanted to do something radical and make the educational system democratic, one would start challenging that situation.</P>
    <P>I wish the welfare officers well and the gift of co-operation with others who are operating the services. However, it will not work until school is made an exciting place. The Minister's proposals in the Bill will have my support if he intends to address the needs of those who are lost through deficiency in legislation or the provision of welfare officers at present. However, as a spokesperson on education, I cannot say that there is a garden of excellence to which those who have not appreciated its finer points are being returned. In addition, its administration is not flexible in terms of what is required.</P>
    <P>I must deal with the real world, which is that children are expelled. The Bill states that one must be offered an option, but it should be put on the record that the current procedures are arbitrary and uncertain and they offend natural justice. The child is often humiliated in front of the parent and the teacher. It is said that either the teacher is a liar or the child is a liar and his or her parents are backing up him or her. The rigmarole goes on and on and this is supposed to be justice within education. It is not justice and if people favour the rights of the child as established in the charter, they should be displayed in every classroom. There should be in-service courses on the rights of the child and parents and the relationship between education and communities. There should be no speeches for a year about education being useful to the economy and speeches instead about education being a component of citizenship and a value for people who want to live responsibly with each other. Then one would be radical and there would be no need to say that one got another wad of money from the Minister for Finance. Good luck to any Minister who does so, but it is not the whole story because the debate about the content, purpose and ethics of education, how to change it, make it exciting and give recognition to all its forms, options and different places in terms of whether it is in the highly regulated State sector or home or other settings is neglected and missing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> I pay tribute to the Minister in relation to second chance education and I ask him to consider my proposal on a number of credits accruing to each citizen as of right. The people who had such credits should be able to go to any educational institution and ask to be served. We should speak about education in terms of it being ultimately aimed at how we can ethically and creatively deal with each other with respect. If we pass these 10,000 children standing around, smoking cigarettes outside places because they got a bad leaving certificate and have nowhere else to go, at the same time as Ireland and Finland are regarded as the model for the world in relation to the economy, we will have seriously failed not only our children but our version of a republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the analysis of Deputy Higgins. I do not disagree with much of what he said but I do not pretend that I can treat the House to the same insights the Deputy gave. Before I deal with the Bill, I wish to mention a couple of points which struck me. There are two interesting items in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, one of which is the outcome of the Foróige Challenge 2000 survey where a significant number of young people were asked for their views. As other speakers noted, it is significant that many of them suffer from poor self-esteem and a lack of self-confidence. They do not feel able to face the world despite the fact that Ireland appears to have the best education system in western Europe.</P>
      <P>Another thought struck me yesterday when the Tánaiste spoke at the launch of the national youth parliament, at which President McAleese was also present. I wondered why so many young people feel turned away from systems generally and, for example, are not attracted to voting. We are concerned about low turnouts at elections. It strikes me &ndash; perhaps it is also the case with this Bill because sometimes we are the worst offenders &ndash; that at times we do not listen to young people as much as we ought to. Sometimes what they say is abrasive, disruptive and annoying, but we must learn to listen to them.</P>
      <P>I was at a meeting this morning of the Ballymun drugs task force, which is currently preparing an action plan for the next couple of years. Many things have been done in Ballymun and in other drugs task force areas but many of the projects are fire brigade type activities. The debate this morning included professionals from across the board &ndash; the probation and welfare service, the health board, local authority officials and local representatives &ndash; and much of what was said could as easily have been part of this debate. It addressed the need for a greater inter-agency approach to dealing with problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a teacher for over 30 years. I started teaching large classes of boys in the early 1960s. The school attendance officer called each week. I will not mention his name but he was a lovable guy. I believe he was a retired garda and he called to each classroom for the names of the most reg<Col N="861" /> ular absentees. Invariably, one realised at the end of the first term that the list was always composed of the same families. I would give my right arm to be able to introduce this Bill. I have some minor reservations but it is a good Bill. Provided the necessary resources are committed, it will address many of the issues regarding early school leaving, absenteeism and the provision of a minimum education. One could say that the Bill is being introduced for people who live in working class areas. There is a connection between high unemployment levels and poor quality housing and early school leaving and disenchantment with education. I can identify the relevant areas in this city, and other Deputies would have no difficulty in identifying their counterparts in rural areas and other cities.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good attempt to identify the problems, focus resources on them and move forward. The Minister is taking the right approach in targeting the underlying causes of non-attendance rather than opting for sanctions for truancy. For my sins, I once served on a school attendance committee in Dublin. When I was elected in 1985, I was enthusiastic to become a member of the committee, although I do not think the committees meet any longer. After a few meetings, I discovered it was largely a waste of time. We invited parents to come before the committee, the ultimate sanction available under the 1926 School Attendance Act. The committee brought poor, unfortunate mothers before it &ndash; I cannot remember a father ever attending. The mothers usually had to drag four or five children with them, a couple of them in buggies, and did their level best to explain why they could not cope with the five, six or 12 year old who was unable to fit into the school system.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Act did not work and we know why. However, I am the first to give great credit to the school attendance officers, particularly those who were recently appointed. They have done a good job in Dublin and have done some of the inter-agency work envisaged in the Bill. If the health board, the local authority and the education services do not network together, we can throw our hats at this issue because the current figure of 10,000 early school leavers will increase incrementally.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the concept of sanctions and I compliment the Minister for departing from it. According to a submission on early school leaving made by the Secretary General of the Department to an Oireachtas committee some months ago, those who leave school early are most likely to swell the ranks of the unemployed. We are, unfortunately, well aware of that. Addressing the reasons for early school leaving is paramount. This Bill goes a long way towards achieving that. It tries, fairly faithfully, to address the needs of children who are on the margins and for whom the mainstream approaches simply do not work and have not worked. Most of the Members present are involved in the teaching profession in some shape or form and we know <Col N="862" /> the type of family, child or student who are simply unable to benefit, regardless of whether they are in third class, junior certificate or a postleaving certificate class. We all know them.</P>
    <P>The drop-out level is unacceptable &ndash; the Minister of State mentioned a figure of 10,000. How did we manage to accumulate such a substantial figure? One of the reasons is that there is no structured arrangement whereby children can transfer easily from primary to post-primary school, certainly in Dublin. In my constituency, a substantial number of children fall through the net. They clock out of sixth class in primary school on 30 June &ndash; many probably leave at the beginning of the last term &ndash; and do not seem to turn up in the post-primary school.</P>
    <P>A woman came to my clinic yesterday to see if I could get her son into one of the local post-primary schools. She was not aware that she was supposed to make some attempt to get him into a post-primary school. I have been dealing with various members of this family for many years. I will not be able to get the woman's son into a post-primary school. I will try, as other Members would, but I do not believe it will be possible. There is a cadre of students who simply drop out.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill to try to track students between primary and post-primary school. Senator Ormonde mentioned this problem when she spoke on the Bill in the Seanad. It is particularly prevalent in Dublin's inner city and I assume it is prevalent elsewhere also. In that regard, the Bill is taking the right direction.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926, has been put on the back burner and has not been enforced to a great extent. The energies of the officials in the Department are now taken up with trying to find places for excluded students, an issue I will return to later. The general aim of the Bill is to provide a minimum standard of education. I do not pretend to know what a minimum standard of education ought to be. One would like to think it was a reasonable competence in reading, writing and arithmetic, but given our poor literacy levels, I sometimes wonder. This was brought to my attention by the correspondence we received from people who are educating their children at home. I must declare a certain level of prejudice. Coming from a teaching background, one has an almost inbuilt feeling that nobody else can provide education as well as teachers.</P>
    <P>I respect the notion that many parents can provide a good quality education. I also acknowledge that some teachers do not provide a good quality education. Much of that is due to the fact that until now, there was little in-service training available for teachers. I received one day's in-service training in my first 12 years of teaching and that was on how to run a school library. That was the level of in-service training so I do not blame teachers. However, I acknowledge that there are teachers who, with the best will in the world, simply are no longer up to the task.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what difference raising the school leaving age to 16 will make. It might encourage <Col N="863" /> some students to remain in the system. If, however, initiatives such as Youthreach and community training workshops are not networked in this area, it will make no difference what is the school leaving age. Many initiatives, such as the early school leaving programme and Youthreach, have been extremely good and worthwhile, as has been the experience in Ballymun. I hope FÁS does not become too greedy by taking away the autonomy of community training workshops, but that is another argument.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to understand why the Department has not approved further youth encounter projects. It approved four in the early 1970s but has reduced that number to two. Such projects were probably the best interventions in providing an option for youngsters who were not able to settle into the normal school system. They were funded much more generously than other educational initiatives at a time when money was scarce and were underpinned by the Van Leer Foundation, Holland. It was an enlightened intervention, but when Van Leer pulled out the Department's enthusiasm waned. Regrettably, it has almost run down youth encounter projects but perhaps the eight to 15 year old initiative might replace them.</P>
    <P>If there is not effective co-ordination of all the services directed at children with truancy and poor school attendance records and their families, we are wasting our time &ndash; I have first hand experience of this. If one tries to undertake a psychological assessment of a ten year old child, it is difficult to get the family doctor involved, even though the situation is better than it was. The local health centre, public health nurse and other agencies are supposed to get involved but they need to be pooled. It is proposed to appoint welfare officers who will bring all those agencies together and I am happy with that because they would assist the schools in early identification of poor school attendance. If the problem is not identified early it will never be dealt with properly. A wide range of measures and early interventions are needed and I compliment the Minister and Minister of State for their work in this area.</P>
    <P>Over the past two or three years some of these initiatives have been linked to the youth services and facilities fund by the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Trade and Recreation, Deputy Flood, and the adult education budget by the Minister of State. However, a criticism is that they probably are project-led and we should try to mainstream them. There are many initiatives in disadvantaged areas, but a similar range of initiatives is not available in non-disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>A long-term phenomenon in Dublin is that children from non-disadvantaged areas tend to attend schools outside their locality where they do not have the same positive supports that they would have in their own areas. I compliment the early start programme and the home-school liai<Col N="864" /> son service which does remarkable work in many areas. Increased remedial services, which were introduced earlier this year will make a difference, but not overnight. When I worked in Trinity College, sociologists said that it would take seven years for an effective intervention to have a real impact. I do not know whether it would take longer than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many schools are extremely proactive in terms of early school leaving by adopting a positive approach to building up children's self-confidence, including rewarding them for good attendance. The school in which I worked always operated on the basis that if one provided an incentive at the end of the school year, such as a weekend away, it was possible using the carrot on a stick approach to encourage even the most reluctant school attendee and he or she benefited reasonably from the system.</P>
      <P>I compliment schools which adopt such an approach but I do not know why other schools seem to find it easy to exclude pupils at a young age. It is <i>ad hoc</i>, arbitrary and unjust and I agree with Deputy Higgins that a huge amount of time is taken up with the Minister's staff traipsing from one school to another trying to find a place for students who are excluded. The time wasted in litigation etc. involving such students is simply inexcusable and I have a difficulty with schools that seem to have too ready an approach to excluding them. However, there are times when schools have no option but to exclude such a student and one must balance the right of the rest of his or her class to receive a good quality education in a positive atmosphere without disruption against the rights of the student, no matter how dysfunctional he or she is, to an education.</P>
      <P>Sections 19 and 20 relate to admissions policy and some of those difficulties may be overcome. Very often students and their parents do not know what is the ethos of a school or what are its expectations and this is more relevant to post-primary schools. Sometimes students enter a school and an objective outsider could say that they patently will not fit in with the ethos of the school because it does not have an active outdoor pursuits programme or varied curriculum and there is no point in them attending the school. An admissions policy agreed with parents and students in advance is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to exclusion and expulsions and we are going some way down the right road in that regard. I refer to the issue of early school leavers in the context of a booming economy. I was amazed when I visited supermarkets and other <Col N="865" /> retail outlets in my constituency at the beginning of the school year to find children working in them. A large number of young people must be choosing to take up low paid jobs and I worry about that. In the 1970s significant numbers of young men in my school opted to work as van helpers for the local bakery and dairy, which soaked up many of those who wanted to opt out of school early. The Bill includes a provision whereby employers must register with the welfare board to ensure that a further education option is available to those who opt out of school early and this might be a safety net. I welcome the Minister's initiative and look forward to implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate on a long overdue Bill. The foundations of the Bill are the outdated school attendance Acts of 1926 and 1963. The real emphasis of the Bill is to ensure that young people receive an adequate education in order that they will not find themselves alienated in an ever-changing workforce, an aim which is commendable.</P>
      <P>This legislation is set against the background of recent reports which reveal that 25 per cent of the adult population display serious literacy problems. Many of these people are unable to read or comprehend the information on the back of a box of paracetamol. With an estimated 5,000 students dropping out of school prior to completing their junior certificate and with up to 10,000 people dropping out prior to completion of their leaving certificate, these alarming statistics are limiting the overall economic and social progress of this country.</P>
      <P>The link between educational attainment and personal and national economic benefit is well established. One need only have listened to Marian Finucane's programme on Radio One this morning, in which she interviewed young women in the new women's prison at Mountjoy, to realise the clear link between low levels of educational attainment and criminal activity. Many of these women are retraining and up-skilling in the hope of entering the workforce and leaving their pasts behind them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increased accountability of schools in regard to children who are at risk of becoming early school leavers. This measure will hopefully enable the Department of Education and Science to track children and their progress through the system and to ensure they receive a minimum standard of education. However, to date, the Department has failed to investigate the extent of truancy or compile statistics on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to break the cycle of poverty and tackle disadvantage is through the provision of adequate funding to ensure all students have equal access to all levels of education. The Bill imposes statutory duties on schools to adopt a more proactive approach to the issue of truancy and to provide a mechanism for co-ordinating the activities of various publicly funded agencies in <Col N="866" /> regard to matters relating to school attendance. This is a very welcome move.</P>
    <P>The evidence heard by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science reveals that many young people are currently falling through the net in the transfer from primary to secondary school due to the lack of any follow-up procedures between school principals. The reporting system set out in the previous Acts were haphazard for a number of reasons. Some schools did not have sufficient time to report the figures and quite often did not bother reporting them as they wished to keep attendance records high for a variety of reasons. I am not suggesting that this applied in every case but it was not unheard of.</P>
    <P>Truancy eventually leads to early school leaving. The two go hand in hand. Research carried out by Bolton in 1994 suggests that issues such as poor study facilities at home, inadequate and poor housing and health issues are included in the decision of a young person as to whether he or she will remain in school. While the Minister speaks about the co-ordination of the activities of various publicly funded agencies, I do not believe we will see this in practice. For example, the Department of Education and Science has failed over many years to co-ordinate the speech therapy service with the Department of Health and Children. How will it ensure co-ordination on a multi-agency level when it cannot ensure it with another Government Department? </P>
    <P>While it is difficult to assess the extent of truancy here, a recent survey carried out in County Roscommon, which questioned school principals on pupils who were absent from school for 40 days or more in the preceding 12 month period, revealed that the reasons for absenteeism include illness, family problems and emotional problems. However, respondents stated that the reason for absenteeism in 41 per cent of pupils absent for 40 days or more was unknown. The survey revealed that one pupil was continually absent as the child had &ldquo;a long distance to travel with no reliable means of transport&rdquo;. That is an unbelievable situation in this day and age. In two other cases, absenteeism was blamed on a lack of interest and/or discipline on the part of parents. These were just two specific cases which the principals were able to note. The survey was a useful one and I would urge the Minister to have a look at it. Although the survey does not go into great detail, it gives some idea of the level of absenteeism. The absenteeism in this instance was calculated on a 40-day standard. The levels in this survey were quite low but they would certainly be magnified dramatically in many urban areas.</P>
    <P>Up to 12 per cent of children leaving primary school have little or no literacy or numeracy skills. All schools now have access to a remedial service. However, the service is a token one in many schools at present and the Minister is only paying lip service to the provision of remedial teachers throughout the country. The survey carried out in County Roscommon reveals that a <Col N="867" /> remedial teacher is available to an average school for approximately five days per month. Some 58 per cent of schools share a remedial teacher with at least five other schools. A proper remedial service at primary school level can reap major benefits for children who receive that extra tuition and attention and can ensure they are not alienated from our education system. The Minister must provide funding for a real service and ensure funds are available for the provision of a proper classroom environment for remedial teachers, rather than forcing them into cloakrooms, as is the case at present. Unless a proper service is provided and teachers are taken out of the broom cupboards, this service will fail to meet the needs of the children who require it most.</P>
    <P>The schools' psychological service is another area of neglect. I recently became aware of a case in which parents were obliged to pay £200 for an educational and psychological assessment of their child which would enable the child to qualify for certain essential educational services. The psychological service provided by the Department of Education and Science was unable to cope with the demand for it. While there have been improvements recently, psychologists can still only spend a limited amount of time in schools which are fortunate enough to have a psychological service. Many counties, including County Roscommon, are still without any psychological service. It is unacceptable that parents should have to pay £200 for a psychological assessment which is essential for their child's educational needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about ensuring that young people under 18 years of age who leave school early are identified. Once identified, the National Education Welfare Board will assist them in accessing continued education and training. The current school curriculum is too driven by the points system to allow education for all our children. Alternative curriculum models such as the NCVA and the leaving certificate applied problems, though excellent, are difficult to implement because of restricted staffing resources and because young people who choose this route become labelled. It is unfortunate that this labelling occurs but it is a fact of life. New approaches to these models are required if we are to overcome this kind of stigmatism and ensure that resources are put in place to allow all schools to provide these courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also highlighted the need for employers to become involved in the education system to ensure that early school leavers continue to participate in education, a commendable ideal. As a result of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, it is to be welcomed that young people of school-going age can no longer wander from the school to the workplace without an authorised certificate.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about placing the onus on the employer to provide a young person with ongoing education and training. This is a noble <Col N="868" /> objective but the legislation does not impose obligations on the employer to either provide the training or ensure the release of employees to access this training.</P>
    <P>The lack of a concrete commitment to expand Youthreach, post-leaving certificate courses and VTOS on a part-time basis or to develop support services such as child care and guidance illustrates the lack of commitment to ensure lifelong learning. When 97 per cent of small firms are experiencing serious recruitment difficulties, employers must take a new approach to the continuing education of their workforce. Two thirds of companies state that the lack of basic skills such as literacy, numeracy and interpersonal skills is the main reason they cannot fill vacancies in the workforce. This problem is not limited to employers. Both FÁS and Teagasc are finding increasing literacy problems among apprentices and must run basic literacy education along with their mainstream courses. Without basic literacy skills unemployed people can neither get jobs nor access FÁS or CERT training programmes.</P>
    <P>There is complacency in Government and economic circles about the enormous issue of poverty and literacy, a specific problem requiring urgent attention. Statistics show that young people who leave school without the necessary qualifications will spend their lives on the poverty threshold. ESRI research has shown that 94 per cent of households in poverty are headed by an early school leaver. Of these, 75 per cent have no qualification whatsoever and 19 per cent have only a junior certificate. Failure to adequately tackle the problem in the coming decade will not only constitute a serious injustice but will place a large burden on the future economic growth of the country. The Minister must ensure that anyone who has not stayed at school after junior certificate level should be offered a chance to participate in adult education free of charge. VTOS and back to education schemes should be extended to certain part-time courses to facilitate participation by those with family commitments. We should also encourage employers and trade union bodies to develop workplace training partnerships, with emphasis on workers with literacy problems, and appoint full-time education co-ordinators to promote adult education in disadvantaged areas. Deputy Carey referred to the question of disadvantage. He is lucky resources are being provided in his and other urban constituencies. Five schools in County Roscommon have been designated disadvantaged while 21 primary schools in the county do not have hot running water.</P>
    <P>This legislation will place an added burden of paperwork on principals, particularly teaching principals. One wonders where teaching principals will find the time to deal with the paperwork connected with this legislation as well as the enormous amount required for other departmental grant applications. I have had to encourage school principals to make applications for funding for various initiatives but they simply do not have <Col N="869" /> the time to make submissions to the Department. In County Roscommon 98 per cent of all primary schools have teaching principals. Are these teachers to do this paperwork after school hours or should they leave their pupils unsupervised while they do so during the school day? It will defeat the purpose of the legislation if a teacher must leave a class to work, or perhaps not work, on its own while he completes a report on truancy. The question of providing the resources needed to make this legislation succeed must be examined closely but, sadly, the Minister said this evening that the legislation has no resource implications. We must provide a proper remedial service for primary schools. Some 12 per cent of young people leaving primary school cannot read, write or add properly. This unacceptable situation leads directly to truancy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the strong emphasis in the Bill on the importance of obtaining the written agreement of parents of children before action is taken. Sadly, many such parents are the products of a system which has failed them and will be incapable of reading any notice they may receive in the post. Some 25 per cent of the adult population do not have basic literacy skills. How will they know the contents of a letter. They will be unable to ask their son or daughter for help because they will not have been in school. The Minister has provided resources for a home-school liaison scheme but he must provide more because the scheme is an invaluable resource. If we are to co-ordinate State bodies, as the Minister hopes, people must be appointed to liaise with the various services. If this is not done, many young people will slip through the net and will not be helped. Unless we are prepared to provide resources to implement this legislation properly we are wasting our time discussing it.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies have received correspondence from parents who teach their children at home. I know the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Science have received large amounts of correspondence from these parents. Concerns have been raised regarding this legislation and amendments have been suggested. I hope we can discuss these matters in detail on Committee Stage and come to a solution which is acceptable to all. We must ensure that our young people do not drop out of school at the age of 14 or 15. We see from statistics that 5,000 leave school even before the junior certificate. I commend the Minister for increasing the minimum school leaving age to 16 years. If I had my way I would increase it further to 18 years or until pupils have completed the junior certificate, whichever is sooner. Many young people who have reached the age of 16 have not received an education and there is no point keeping them in the education system if we do not provide the resources necessary to teach them to read and write and to give them the basic skills necessary to gain employment or take advantage of training opportunities which will enable them to progress to further employment in the future. The ques<Col N="870" /> tion of resources is the most important one to be raised as we discuss this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minster on bringing this Bill before the House. This is indicative of his concern about this issue and the Bill is timely but long overdue. I speak for a number of Dublin Deputies when I say this is an area that has been neglected over the years, particularly in the more disadvantaged communities in my constituency in Tallaght. There is a pressing need for this legislation and my constituents have pressed for the early introduction of this initiative. Large disadvantaged communities are not sharing in the enormous wealth that has been created by our successful economy.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is determined to address the issue of school attendance. We have a Minister who listens. Deputy Naughten will appreciate the Minister's indication in his speech to the Seanad on this Bill that he is prepared to consider changes on foot of suggestions put forward by the other side of the House which are helpful and positive and would enhance and improve the Bill. I am sure such suggestions will be forthcoming and the Minister, Deputy Martin, will seriously entertain those suggestions.</P>
      <P>The link between education and societal and economic opportunity and achievement is well documented. It should not fall to me tonight to point up the evidence which is obvious and well documented at this stage, of the link between educational attainment and job opportunities and success in life. Let us not be afraid to describe those who opt into the world of work and decide to make the best of things for themselves and their families as successful people. These are the people we want to encourage. Unfortunately, our economy has produced a certain class of people who have not shared in the benefits of education. It is one of the hallmarks of our successful economy that a strategic decision was taken 25 to 30 years ago to invest in education right through from the 1960s onwards. It is the hallmark of all parties in this House, Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil &ndash; all the different parties who participated in Government &ndash; that they have invested in education and in the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the 1980s I worked with the inner London education authority during which time Mrs. Thatcher began a campaign for the abolition of that authority. It is no exaggeration to say that during the 1980s in London major damage was done to the fabric of British society because of her initiation &ndash; based on her faith and ideology &ndash; of a full frontal attack on teachers who she viewed as some sort of left wing commissars. It was wholly wrong and unjustified and led to a decline in the standards of education available to the ordinary British citizen and to the many immigrants who flocked to that country because of its colonial past. We should be mindful of that as society presses ahead. We must always renew our faith in education, our commitment to the <Col N="871" /> teaching profession and to those educationalists who are fighting a good case, particularly in disadvantages areas, to try to get the necessary resources, extra teachers and the attention of society to focus on education and educational issues.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome Bill. I hope the new board will establish its credibility fast and focus on disadvantaged areas. There is an ongoing debate in ministerial and educational circles on whether the benefits should be shared across all schools or should be focused more on disadvantaged schools. I consider myself part of the lobby group that would say we should focus a good deal more of our energies and resources on disadvantaged schools. It is wrong to suggest that this or any other Bill introduced by the Minister during the next four years will produce an immediate short-term response or reaction in terms of improvements in attainment levels in certain disadvantaged areas. That will not be attainable. It will be perhaps eight years, before we get to grips with the problem of adult illiteracy and dysfunctional family set ups which lead to low educational achievement. It will be a long hard road, but addressing these problems demands of this and other Governments that the necessary resources be ploughed into disadvantaged schools. I know this causes problems in schools that are serving more affluent areas which do not have disadvantaged status. The Minister is reviewing the allocation of resources in respect of schools with disadvantaged status. A phenomenon in my constituency and, I suspect, in many other urban areas is the flight of children from an area because their parents opt to send them to other schools that have the perception of being more advantaged. That causes problems down the line because those schools do not have the resources to deal the intake of students from disadvantaged areas, yet the schools in disadvantaged areas that have the resources and the full complement of teachers cannot attract enough parents in the area to send their children to school there.</P>
    <P>I was struck by Deputy Naughten's reference to Marian Finucane's show this morning during which a number of female prisoners in the new women's prison in Mountjoy made the point that they hoped to get the chance of an education through the prison system. It is appalling that it takes that level of indictment and referral to prison before people discover fully the benefits of education. Many of the women prisoners suggested that if they had adequate access to education earlier, perhaps they would not have turned out the way they did. It is popular to blame parents, but some of those women were most anxious to point out that their being in prison was not their parent's fault and that they were the only persons in their families who had gone down the wrong route. It is impossible to design a system to prevent everyone from sliding into criminality and wrongdoing, but this Bill will go some way towards achieving that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Deputy Carey made a good point about rewards. In regard to all of these early and pre-school interventions that we are making, there must be a reward system built in for the pupils. They must feel it is a good thing to go to school. It is not enough to proselytise on this point, there needs to be a system of rewards for pupils and for parents who send their children to school so that we can encourage compliance in this area.</P>
    <P>Another issue prominent in this matter is that the Bill talks about tracking pupils. I hope the board in which the Minister is investing so much attention will have the necessary resources to intervene effectively to encourage pupils to go to school. When I visit schools in my constituency I am struck, as I sure is Deputy Hayes, by the extent to which the schools that enjoy disadvantaged status are improving all the time precisely because they involve parents. A key point that must be rammed home to the Minister and to everybody involved in education is that if a school gets disadvantaged status and engages itself in a genuine partnership with the parents involving them in adult education programmes which may lead some parents to return to school to do their leaving certificate or to take up another training course, that has a huge effect.</P>
    <P>I remember visiting a school in Tymon in my constituency and I was very struck that 20 women there who, perhaps, did not have the opportunity of an education and were beginning to feel the lack of it in terms of their advancement in the booming economy and their access to job opportunities felt strongly that they had missed out and they did not want that to happen to their children. To avoid that they became involved not only in the life of the school and its management but in learning and they had taken up courses. That is why I want to come to the issue the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea addresses in his Green Paper, which will soon become a White Paper that will deal with the issue of adult education and literacy. Deputy Naughten made the point about the three key indicators being literacy, numeracy and interpersonal skills. Despite our major advances, the so-called fabled &ndash; and I call it that deliberately &ndash; information revolution has not led to a corresponding increase in literacy, numeracy and the development of interpersonal skills among children in schools. That is the case across the board, not just in disadvantaged areas. This is a vital issue to consider not only in the context of adult education but in the schools. It is not enough for children go to school. There are basic levels of attainment that must be achieved, particularly in relation to literacy, numeracy and scientific and technology type issues.</P>
    <P>I note that IBEC is developing a policy on business links in education. This is very important in disadvantaged areas. One must understand that we are talking, in some cases, of an intergenerational lack of achievement in education and lack of opportunity or access to a job. In these areas it is vital that we see, what I might term, &ldquo;the com<Col N="873" /> mercial interest&rdquo; engaging with the school in a meaningful way so that there is link set up between employment and education to ensure people at an early age see the benefit of that and see the workplace not as a place where their parents and grandparents never went, but as a place in which they too can take part. That is very important. This is often a very much neglected area in our education system. Some school children never see the real world of work. I do not intend to criticise the teaching profession, but teachers suffer from a deficit in this regard in that they do not realise the pressing, commercial reality of society.</P>
    <P>That concludes my contribution.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the fact that waiting lists for local authority housing have increased by over 50 per cent in two years, that many such applications have been outstanding for lengthy periods, deplores the hardship evidenced by these facts and calls on the Government to:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important ways in which the State can make a difference to the quality of people's lives can be tested in the number and quality of homes which are currently being provided to people on low incomes. Historically, the State has a proud record in its ability to provide low cost housing to thousands of citizens. Since local authorities were first established, in excess of 330,000 dwellings have been built, over 90 per cent of which were later sold off to tenant purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the rental market in Ireland, both in the private and public sectors, is relatively smaller than in other European Union countries, we have, nonetheless, in difficult financial times provided various housing options to meet the needs of a large variety of income groups. Shelter and <Col N="874" /> housing were regarded by the majority of citizens as fundamental rights within our society, but this is no longer the case. Ask any Member of this House to state the issue which has become the most pressing issue in recent times and they would all agree that the most problematic issue that confronts politicians at local and national level is the housing crisis. We are all demoralised at seeing the continuous stream of constituents who find themselves, frequently with a small family, waiting to be offered a house from a local authority. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the problem of domestic overcrowding is worse today than it was in the Ireland of the 1950s. None of us should underestimate the long-term damage that is being caused to families who frequently share a three bedroom house with an extended family of sometimes seven or eight adults. The obvious tension this produces cannot be underestimated.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the tradition of investing resources in the provision of social housing has been completely overturned by the actions of the Government. While everyday we read the latest report on the housing crisis, it seems that very little attention is given to the untold misery of people who are waiting for local authorities to provide them with a home. That misery can best be seen in the dramatic escalation in the number of applicants looking for housing from their respective local authority. Because the housing market is out of control in excess of 100,000 men, women and children are paralysed on a waiting list, with little chance of being housed. If commentators want to see the real testimony of the Government's failure, it definitely can be seen in the massive increase in the number of people who require social housing.</P>
    <P>The motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party clearly signals that we are not building the requisite number of local authority houses to meet the huge demand that exists. Yesterday we heard from the Department of Finance that the current budget surplus this year is likely to exceed £1.8 billion, excluding the Government's privatisation programme plans. Is it not, therefore, a disgrace that in this year when so much has been created in our economy about 5,000 new homes will be built to cater for the 45,000 applicants in need of housing. Fine Gael believes that we have the resources to massively expand the national house building programme and that such a programme should now be prioritised by the Government.</P>
    <P>Our motion also mandates the Government to undertake an audit of all land in the ownership of the State for the purposes of making more land available for social housing projects. Virtually no work has taken place in this area at interdepartmental level, and that was clearly expressed to me today during Question Time. As a result, a large number of local authorities have a deficient land bank and are looking for housing land to build various housing schemes. They are unable to do that at the moment because the land is not available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> Today the Minister of State with responsibility for housing revealed the best kept secret in his Department, namely, that more than 45,000 applicants are in need of social housing. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has been negligent in not allowing an emergency assessment, as Fine Gael proposed last year, to help his negotiations with the Minister for Finance. Last year Fine Gael proposed that an emergency assessment should be done in this area. By delaying publication of the national housing assessment by six months, the Minister of State has helped to delay the inevitable expenditure of additional moneys for the national house building programme. It is most interesting to learn that the figures announced by the Minister of State today are virtually identical to those which Fine Gael published last year when it undertook an assessment on its own behalf, and it was the only political party to do so. The figures it produced last year are identical to the figures produced by the Minister of State today, and he refused on that occasion to concede to an emergency assessment, which he has the power to do under the 1990 Housing Act. Twelve months ago I asked him to do that but he refused and he is negligent in his position as Minister of State with responsibility for housing.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem is well known but an emergency assessment last year would have helped the Minister in negotiating a much larger package of funding from the Department of Finance. Why did it take over six months to have the official national housing assessment published? The inertia and paralysis shown by the Minister with responsibility for housing on this issue has ensured that an emergency response from Government to the problem was long-fingered. I ask the Government to consider the introduction of a yearly housing assessment which could, in conjunction with every local housing authority, monitor current trends and demands. It is ridiculous, given the extent of the housing crisis, that we must wait for three yearly intervals before obtaining the necessary data to provoke any Government to reply with additional resources.</P>
    <P>After two years in office, the Government has finally woken up to the scale of the national housing list, so much so that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, decided to tell his party's conference earlier this year that his Department would provide an additional 22,000 new housing starts over the next four years. Last May he informed me in a written reply that local authorities had been requested to set in train the necessary preparatory work in identifying schemes for inclusion in a four year housing programme. On 1 June I was informed that the multi-annual local housing building programme that the Minister announced had a price tag of £2 billion and that the precise funding requirement had still to be determined by the Department of Finance. Will the Minister inform us of his progress to date in instructing local authorities to <Col N="876" /> present his Department with their building programme and in finalising the exact cost of such a programme over the next four years with his colleague, the Minister for Finance? It is time to move this debate on from the pious promises and cheap public relations stunts which are a feature of the Government's response to the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>Despite the Bacon reports and a series of high profile announcements, the Government's housing policy is falling apart at the seams. The Taoiseach should directly intervene to deliver one of the most straightforward obligations a State can offer &ndash; the obligation to provide shelter for its people. As the number of homeless persons has doubled over the past three years and the number of people looking for council houses has also increased, there is a real sense that a generation of people will never obtain security of tenure. It is obvious that the problems of house price inflation is having a hugely detrimental effect on the ability of young people to buy a home. Throughout this debate, we have spent little time dealing with the problems associated with our national housing list which, as I said, has rapidly increased in recent times. The Government is spending less on the provision of social housing than the Government which Fine Gael led only three years ago. Indeed, a dwindling output of houses in the social sector has been a persistent policy and feature of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Governments. In addition, as has happened recently, there has been a massive increase in the numbers seeking social housing. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is led by the market, incessantly believes in the notion of supply and does not address the issue of affordability. Given this, is it surprising that more than 100,000 men, women and children are seeking local authority houses?</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that available resources are considerably greater in 1999 than was the case in 1995, 1996 or even 1997, I cannot understand why the Government is spending just 6.9 per cent of its total capital expenditure on the provision of public housing. I have said repeatedly over the summer that this is the lowest investment in the capital programme announced by any Government in recent times. The Government, and especially the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, stands indicted for this. The lowest level of expenditure in this area by a Fine Gael led Government amounted to 8 per cent of total capital expenditure while over 9 per cent was reached in 1995. Times are much better now and there is no excuse for directing a smaller percentage of capital expenditure towards providing public housing for people on council housing lists. It is a public disgrace that real expenditure has reduced at a time when the need for social housing has increased so dramatically.</P>
    <P>The amount of public expenditure on the provision of social housing is one thing, but I was amazed to discover recently that fewer local auth<Col N="877" /> ority homes were purchased or built in 1998 than was the case in any of the three previous years. Last year the State purchased or built only 3,504 houses in the local authority sector despite the fact that a massive 45,000 applicants are now on the housing list. How can the Government claim to be spending more money on the public housing programme when there are 3 per cent fewer starts and acquisitions than was the case in the previous year?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has a tendency to attempt to shift the blame for the failure to provide more housing to the local authority sector, especially to local authority housing departments. If he has criticisms of individual housing authorities who are not pulling their weight, he should name them in public. Moreover, if he feels they are unable to deliver their building programme he should take steps to ask another body to do the job.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at areas of the country where there is an especially high demand for social housing provision. Taking the example of Dublin, with four housing authorities, is it possible to co-ordinate and streamline their ability to increase housing output and, by extension, to reduce unnecessary bureaucratic bottlenecks? If we are not getting the required volume of social housing output from our local authorities we may have to look at another form of response at local level. While we all supported the break-up of the old Dublin County Council into three new dynamic areas which would deliver local services to the public in a much more coherent way, would it not be better, given the housing needs in the city and county, to have one housing authority for the entire region to deal with specific problems? Undoubtedly, bureaucratic problems stand in the way of producing additional housing stock. I look forward to the views of the Minister of State on this proposal.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the output from the voluntary housing sector has plummeted. I am aware of the Minister of State's decision to increase the limits of assistance available under the capital assistance scheme, but the initiative by itself cannot allow the voluntary housing sector to increase its output unless a sufficient supply of land is provided. Last year saw the lowest output ever &ndash; 500 houses &ndash; from this very small sector, yet at a time when there were much fewer resources available it produced 1,000 houses annually. We should support this sector. The Minister of State's initiative on the capital assistance programme will do nothing unless land is made available by local authorities to voluntary associations.</P>
    <P>While we hear many congratulatory statements on behalf of the Government concerning the housing output in the private sector, the percentage of completions for social housing units continues to fall. It is inevitable that the gap between the public and private housing schemes will continue to grow unless new funding is introduced. It is the intention of my party, in the utilisation of our time in this debate tonight and tomorrow <Col N="878" /> night, to put this issue centre stage and to demand an additional 40,000 social housing units for the next four years, at the rate of 10,000 starts each year.</P>
    <P>If the Government cannot co-ordinate a simple requirement to build additional housing for the people who are stuck on a local authority housing list it should not be in office. Having spent two years blaming the previous Administration, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, must begin to take responsibility for this area of policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 18 years since I was first elected to this House I have seen the wheel come full circle on local authority housing. In 1981 and for a couple of years after it was one of the most pressing preoccupations of any Member of this House or of a local authority. Indeed, I recall an occasion when, following the allocation of some 40 houses in a part of my constituency, there was a demonstration in the streets by people who were not among those to whom they were allocated. The situation was very difficult.</P>
      <P>In the years between 1982 and 1987 we managed, at a time of great difficulty, to find the resources to gradually expand the local authority house building programme. Progress was maintained for some years afterwards and I was delighted to see this. We got to the point &ndash; most Members of the House will know what I am talking about &ndash; where, from being a major preoccupation in a Deputy's weekly life in dealing with constituents, housing had gone down the list. That was the case in the early part of the 1990s. However, for the past two years, it has gone up the list, at an accelerating rate, of the preoccupations of all our constituents. There has been increasing pressure on local authorities and local authority waiting lists increase inexorably month after month, quarter after quarter.</P>
      <P>It has taken months of argument and a Fine Gael Private Members' motion to awaken the Government from its apparent indifference to the misery represented by the current level of waiting lists for local authority housing. Until today the Government, especially the Minister of State, has indulged in endless prolix, voluble self-congratulation about its own inadequate action. I am sorry it has taken that long because it has meant a great deal of suffering for a great many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, today, after months of denial and smug self-congratulation, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, finally admitted to the extent of the waiting list problem. Today he suddenly announced new local authority house construction targets for the next four years. To hear on 5 October that there is a new target for local authority housing completions for this year leaves me less than convinced. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever but that when we come back here after the Christmas recess, if indeed this Dáil reassembles after the Christmas recess, and we get the final figures for the year, the local authority housing starts for 1999 will not match up to <Col N="879" /> the figure the Minister announced today on Question Time.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, finally admitted that almost 40,000 applicants are judged to be in need of housing by local authorities and that, in addition, a further 6,600 applicants are judged to be in need of rent supplementation in order to assist them in affording private rented accommodation. There are almost 40,000 applications on the waiting list for housing by local authorities. This means that in the region of 100,000 people are seeking accommodation by local authorities and, in the words of the Minister of State, are judged to be in need of housing by local authorities. These are not frivolous applications, they are not people who can make other provision for themselves, they are people who are judged to be in need of housing by local authorities &ndash; perhaps 100,000 people. Among these applicants are people in all circumstances, traditional families, lone parents, people in other relationships and so on. These people have one thing in common, they are judged to be in need of housing by a local authority. This means they are living in fairly bad, very bad or utterly inadequate conditions and many of them are homeless under the statutory definitions that exist. Many of these applicants are living in over-crowded conditions, perhaps with the parents of one of the applicant couple or with the parents of a lone parent and other members of that person's family. I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, ever considers this or ever talks to these people, but listening to applicants in that situation describe the circumstances of their daily lives indicates that this is very often a picture of misery.</P>
    <P>I am not very impressed by the way in which the Minister of State is dealing with these issues. I received an answer from him today on another issue which showed absolutely no sympathy for the plight of people on low incomes. He would do well to reflect on the position of the people I have described in light of the experience of the Tánaiste during the last general election when she proposed, in an incredibly heartless way, to increase and perpetuate over-crowding in housing by issuing one of her famous soundbites that promptly turned around and bit her. The Minister of State is showing the same lack of understanding and concern. The numbers of people on local authority waiting lists have increased in the past two years more than anyone would have expected because there are large numbers of people on these waiting lists who up to three years ago would have been able to afford to buy their own house. However, the fact that the prices of starter homes have gone so far out of reach of the average person means that more and more people who would have previously afforded their own homes are now on local authority housing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It gives me a shudder down my spine to hear the Minister of State say today that things are <Col N="880" /> improving, that the rate of increase in house prices is going down when what he is actually saying is that in the most recent period for which he has data, house prices increased by only 16 per cent whereas in the previous comparable period they had increased by 25 per cent. This means that over the total of these two periods there has been an increase of more than 40 per cent in house prices. The Minister of State comes in here, congratulates himself and expects us to participate in the cheers and jubilations when he says the rate of increase in house prices is decreasing. House prices are still increasing inexorably and going further and further beyond the reach of the average couple, putting more and more people on local authority housing waiting lists. It has taken two years of argument to get the Minister of State to accept what this means in practical terms.</P>
    <P>The figures issued by the Minister of State today show that 6,600 applicants are judged to be in need of rent supplementation. This indicates that as a result of the shortage of local authority accommodation 16,000 people are forced to pay rents they cannot afford for private rented accommodation, much of which is in appallingly bad condition. Everyone in this House knows what I am talking about when I say that people are receiving rent supplements from the health boards to live in private rented accommodation that ought to be condemned and in which people should not be asked to live. I will not draw the pictures because everyone here knows what I am talking about &ndash; they meet these cases every week. There are approximately 16,000 people in those circumstances. In some cases these people are paying substantial amounts of rent and health boards are paying out substantial amounts of public money to subsidise and assist them because there is nowhere else for them to go. These people have been on a local authority waiting list for God knows how long. They cannot stay where they are, they are forced out into the private rented sector, they get into very bad accommodation for which they pay substantial rents and must be supplemented by the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's acceptance of the figures is far too late. I wish I could feel confident that in accepting the figures today he was saying that he understands what lies behind them, the hardship, misery and difficulty for family relationships. If he did, he would take the opportunity to do more than he has proposed. I do not believe he will do what he proposes for this year and I have not much confidence that what he proposes for next year will be done. Some 130,000 people are hoping that he means what he says and if he lets them down, he will be judged very harshly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time of great economic gain and tax receipts of £1 billion ahead of targets, we have created a nation of haves and have nots in terms of a place to live or a roof over the heads of the citizens of this State. The number of have nots has grown considerably. Since assuming <Col N="881" /> office the Government has presided over a local authority housing list which has grown by over 50 per cent. Many of these people never dreamt they would find themselves in this position, a position where they are dependent on the State to provide them and their families with somewhere to live. The lack of affordable housing has created a new type of local authority applicant, people on average incomes who cannot possibly afford to buy a house near their place of work. The State has not recognised the real hardship many of these families face. The State is slow in the business of building and it builds as it pleases. It chose to purchase fewer local authority houses in 1998 than in any of the previous years. This does not make sense. Why has the Government been so slow to react to the growing numbers who cannot afford to buy their own homes?</P>
      <P>This problem has existed for some time and there has been much rhetoric about the increased funding available for local authority housing. However, the reality is that house prices and building prices have increased. Fewer local authority houses are being built this year than in previous years. House prices have risen and continue to do so. They are at such levels that they now prohibit low to middle income earners from purchasing their own homes. There is a nationwide shortage of suitable building sites for affordable housing. I strongly support the motion which calls on the Government to immediately complete an audit of all State property with a view to increasing the supply of land for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>How else can the Government initiate the development of 45,000 new homes, which is the number required to address the needs of citizens, unless we know the extent of the land available to build upon? The Minister of State must be seen to drive this important element of the State's house building programme and carry out this vital assessment. It is not just a matter for local authorities; it is also a matter for the Minister of State himself. The shortage of suitable land in many local authority areas &ndash; particularly the large urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick &ndash; is impacting severely on the ability of local authorities to match their increasing housing needs. Therefore, they will have to become more innovative and look outside their own boundaries in accessing suitable sites to meet developing housing needs.</P>
      <P>Over many years, tenant purchasing schemes have depleted local authority housing stock and the increasing demand is not being addressed in a satisfactory fashion. It is not being addressed by a suitable building programme nor by the fact that there has been a decrease in local authority acquisitions in recent years. So, at a time when we have increased demand for social housing, the sad reality is that the rate of production is not only failing to match demand but is also decreasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of shared-ownership schemes is also showing a downward trend. Because of the increasing cost of housing many people still can<Col N="882" /> not afford to buy a house even when assisted to do so. The rate of take up of local authority loans is also falling and I am not surprised because, with a limit of £50,000, there are not many houses available at that price around the country. In 1993, for instance, a local authority mortgage covered approximately 65 per cent of the average house price, today it amounts to 45 per cent or less. The local authority mortgage scheme &ndash; one of the main planks which enabled those on middle or low incomes to purchase their own homes &ndash; is slowly fading out and is no longer available to such people. People who cannot buy their own homes are faced with the inevitable local authority waiting list. They must approach the local housing officer as well as visiting politicians' clinics to ask them to make representations on their behalf. They never know where they stand nor when, or if, they will be housed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned his 18 years in politics. I was elected to the House two years ago. Following my election I visited the local city manager and his officials to introduce myself. One of the first things the city manager said was that if I wanted to make representations his staff would be happy to deal with me. However, on the issue of housing they would not be able to give any response whatsoever because they simply could not cope with the applications from those seeking accommodation and with representations from politicians. That was my introduction to the housing crisis and at every weekly clinic I have held since, people attend who are faced with the problem of not having a house and not knowing when they will be housed. It is a difficult situation because one has no answer for them. One can contact the corporation or local county council but in one's heart and soul one knows they will not be housed this year or next. Based on the figures the Minister of State has released today, such housing will certainly not be available in the foreseeable future either. That is the sad reality.</P>
    <P>Housing is one of the main social problems and the lack of affordable housing is really affecting people. At a time of economic boom when money is available to the Government which was not predicted last year, why are so many citizens deprived of housing units? I support the motion and I hope we will see investment and innovative measures from the Government to try to address the serious housing problem facing many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>No other problem demands so much time of public representatives, whether as local authority members or Members of the Oireachtas, as housing. This is the Minister of State's second coming in the housing area. He was previously Minister for the Environment and monuments still remain in some places to his endeavours at that time. In the Minister of State's own constituency, houses without chimneys were built in Rahoon. That is what he is best known for during that period. Those houses were later demolished and have been replaced by proper <Col N="883" /> housing. The Minister of State should take the initiative now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to take the initiative to provide housing of a quality and variety in which people can live. Over the years the Department of the Environment provided housing that was dull and unimaginative. In many cases small ghettos were created which people quickly wanted to abandon. Hence we now have housing stock in local authority estates that are partially abandoned and very often windows and doors are blocked up. The answer lies in avoiding such examples. The Minister of State needs to radicalise housing but I am afraid that we have seen nothing from his two years in office. We have not seen any adequate housing design. Over the next couple of years, 40,000 housing units will have to be provided, but when will the Minister of State make a start? The Minister of State should co-ordinate the planning and housing endeavours within his own Department.</P>
      <P>In rural County Galway we see examples where people are not allowed to build affordable housing. Planners will say that it is ribbon development. Unless second family dwellings are involved, people cannot build a house in the rural area in which they wish to live. We could build affordable housing in such areas. Sites will become available with the decline in agriculture because many farmers will sell part of their holdings to supplement their income and tide them over a bleak period. Why can the Minister of State not respond by asking planners to release housing land banks in certain areas? </P>
      <P>Today we have seen a consultants' report for Galway city and county which said housing will be brought into Tuam as the focus point outside Galway city. Is that the direction in which we are going? Will we denude rural Ireland by moving, in County Galway's case, into Tuam where something like 4,000 additional houses are planned over the next five years? </P>
      <P>We will never solve the problem in that way but we will denude rural areas. If the Minister of State is to be remembered for anything, it is time he opened the opportunities for rural Ireland to become an area where we can provide housing at affordable prices for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the increase in the level of local authority housing needs and welcomes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;the Government's commitment to an expanded housing programme by local auth<Col N="884" /> orities and the voluntary housing sector and the significantly increased financial resources provided by the Government for these programmes in 1999:</P>
    <P>&ndash;the action being taken by the Government to increase and accelerate the supply of land for housing including social and affordable housing;</P>
    <P>and commends the introduction by the Government of the first ever multiannual programme for the provision of local authority housing to run for the coming four years and to deliver an additional 22,000 local authority dwellings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's social housing strategy and to ask the House to support the measures being taken by the Government in this vitally important area.</P>
    <P>It is well said that those who don't learn from mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them. I wonder how much thought the proponents of this motion have given to the implications of their demands for 10,000 new houses to be built each year by local authorities for the next four years. I know that I will be putting local authorities to the pin of their collar to deliver 22,000 new local authority rented dwellings over the next four years, together with a greatly expanded voluntary housing programme, as well as securing greatly increased output under the affordable housing scheme and the range of other social and affordable housing measures already in train.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside, however, the practical constraints, the effect of the suggested crash programme of local authority house building would inevitably see a return to the provision of large, soulless, peripheral local authority housing estates remote from good public transport, amenities or jobs. This is not a policy which the Government will countenance and I will return to these aspects later. However, first, I want to speak about the Government's overall housing policy.</P>
    <P>The Government has a credible and coherent housing strategy which is designed to increase housing supply, to improve access to housing for lower income groups and to improve the housing conditions of local authority tenants and other key groups such as the elderly, homeless persons and the disabled. In its action programme, the Government set out its key housing priorities, including a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups, refurbishment of existing inadequate housing, improvement and extension of social housing schemes, maximum co-ordination of housing policy under my Department and local authorities developing serviced sites to accelerate the supply of new houses to meet the rising demands of those who need housing. Since the Government took office we have made remarkable progress, particularly in tackling escalating <Col N="885" /> house prices, increasing housing output and in widening and strengthening social housing measures.</P>
    <P>I have published today the results of the assessments of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last. These indicate that a total of 39,176 households were in need of local authority housing compared with 27,427 in March 1996. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by other housing options, including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes, compared to a total of 6,047 households similarly assessed in 1996.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the needs in county council and county borough areas were found to have increased by about 50 per cent on average while the level of increase in urban district council areas averaged 23 per cent. However, 20 authorities, and these were mostly urban district councils, recorded a reduction in the numbers on their waiting lists. The spatial variation of the changing need profile throughout the country reveals particularly large increases in the Dublin area, Limerick County Council, Mayo, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognises that there is an increased need for local authority housing as evidenced by the results of the assessments. Because of the importance of these assessments, my Department has devoted considerable effort to collating the results from all local authorities to bring together the overall picture of total local authority housing needs and I was pleased to be in a position to release the overall findings earlier today. This is considerably earlier than was the case with the 1996 assessment where results were not published until the middle of December.</P>
    <P>The 1999 assessment also identifies, separately, households consisting of one adult and one or more children. This category accounts for about 17,000 households, or 43 per cent of the entire net need and approximately 11,000 of these households consist of one adult and one child. The assessment identifies 622 traveller households in need of permanent accommodation in residential caravan parks and halting sites. This is in addition to the 1,406 traveller households assessed as seeking local authority housing. A more comprehensive survey of homelessness utilising the broader definition of homeless persons, which includes those who have no accommodation as well as those in hostels and in health board accommodation, was undertaken on this occasion and the results indicate that on this basis there are some 5,200 homeless persons. The number in 1996 was 2,500 but this is not directly comparable with the recent findings.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the large waiting lists that now exist in many local authority areas and I accept there is a real need for an expanded local authority housing programme. However, the programme which I have set out is appropriate to needs and is, above all, achievable without <Col N="886" /> serious adverse consequences for the tenants. Before I move on from the matter of housing needs assessments I believe it is useful to go behind these assessments a little further to obtain a better understanding of how long people are on waiting lists and how long people spend on the waiting lists before they are housed by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In general, the recent assessments, indicate that over 60 per cent of households are less than two years on waiting lists and this proportion is just slightly up on the position in 1996. It is, of course, accepted that there are now more households on waiting lists. In a recent sample survey of lettings of houses by five different local authorities carried out by my Department it was found that 56 per cent of the households that were housed in the first six months of this year were less than one year on the waiting lists, 22 per cent were between one and two years, 10 per cent were between two and three years and only 7 per cent of those housed during the period were more than four years on the lists. This gives one a slightly different perspective on waiting lists and how long it takes for people to secure housing from their local authority. Local authorities will make over 7,000 new lettings this year. This means that those in the greatest need of housing have a very good prospect of receiving local authority housing within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>Demand has increased dramatically in all housing sectors, exceeding all earlier predictions. Availability of land for housing is critical to increasing the supply of housing, which is the cornerstone of the Government's strategy to meeting demand. It is essential to bring forward serviced land for housing more quickly, to deal effectively with infrastructural constraints or delays to development and to maximise the potential of available land. This applies as much to land for local authority housing as it does to land for private housing.</P>
    <P>We are addressing the land issue in a number of ways. One of these is to identify any land in State ownership that may be surplus to requirements and see if it can be made available quickly to local authorities for the provision of social and affordable housing. However, the extent to which use of State lands can contribute to meeting total social and affordable housing needs must be kept in perspective. While it does not offer the prospect of a quick fix to the issue of land supply, I am anxious to ensure that whatever potential exists in this area is fully exploited.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in areas where pressure on land supply is greatest have a key role, in the first instance, in identifying sites currently owned by public bodies which would have potential for development of social or affordable housing. Where such land is identified, my Department will do everything possible to facilitate the securing of such lands for housing purposes through liaison with the relevant Government Departments. We are, indeed, taking a proactive role in <Col N="887" /> this regard. For example, my Department has been in contact with the Department of Defence regarding the potential use of sites in former Army barracks. We have met a very positive response from the Department of Defence and a number of promising sites have been identified. There are certain issues to be resolved in relation to some of these so it would not be appropriate for me to go into further detail at this stage. However, I am optimistic that they will yield results.</P>
    <P>One point I must make clear is that there is no question of expecting the bodies concerned to give up lands at bargain basement rates. They must operate on the basis of getting good value for any assets they dispose of and any lands provided will have to be purchased at mutually acceptable prices. The key issue is to ensure that local authorities get the opportunity to secure suitable sites on acceptable terms.</P>
    <P>The Churches, as holders of quite significant amounts of serviced land in built up areas, can also make a worthwhile contribution to increasing housing supply in areas where need is most acute and where housing can be developed relatively quickly. I want to acknowledge generously that over the years the Churches and religious orders have made many sites available cheaply or free of charge for the provision of sheltered and other forms of housing for the socially disadvantaged. It is because of their record in doing so that I feel confident that we will have a very co-operative response from the Churches to the current need for social and affordable housing which we are now experiencing. I recognise that the Churches have responsibilities to observe in making decisions about their property assets. Hence, the public authorities realise that they will have to pay a fair price for any Church lands or property made available for social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>Of course, the use of State or institutional land is just one of the avenues being pursued in the drive to maximise and accelerate the availability of land for housing. Within a few months of coming into office the Government launched the serviced land initiative. Funding for this initiative was substantially augmented last year to a total of £39 million Exchequer funding. This, in conjunction with local development levies, will mean a total investment of some £100 million. The serviced land initiative will yield around 100,000 additional housing sites by the end of 2000. This will have a major impact in increasing the supply of land useable for housing, whether local authority, social or private. I expect that 99 schemes will commence construction in 1999, producing over 60,000 serviced sites. An important point is that, in general, once these schemes are in progress, construction work on houses can start and run in parallel with land servicing. Consequently, the serviced land initiative will have an impact in terms of housing output in the short term as well as in the more medium term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> My Department took a further important initiative earlier this year to address possible infrastructural constraints on housing development by requesting local authorities to permit, where appropriate and subject to necessary environmental safeguards, the use of temporary water treatment facilities. This provides an effective and acceptable means of allowing development to proceed in any instance where housing would otherwise be delayed while awaiting the completion of major water and sewerage infrastructures.</P>
    <P>The housing supply provisions in the recently published Planning and Development Bill, 1999, will play a major role in underpinning the future supply of social and affordable housing. The Bill provides for the formulation of comprehensive local authority housing strategies. On the basis of these strategies, the development plans must indicate that up to 20 per cent of land zoned for housing is to be made available for social or affordable housing at its existing use value. These proposals are designed to meet a clearly identified concern of public policy and the common good. The measures are well targeted and clearly defined and will have regard to the prevailing and anticipated housing situation in any area. The impact of the measures is proportionate to the issue being addressed and they have been prepared having regard to the constitutional principles of fairness, equality and proportionality.</P>
    <P>The inclusion for the first time of housing in the forthcoming National Development Plan reflects the Government's commitment to addressing housing needs. Provision will be made for the increased level of the local authority housing programme as well as greatly increased social and affordable housing in the lifetime of the plan. Provision of housing-related infrastructural investment is also an important element both to alleviate existing bottlenecks on housing development and to underpin provision for housing needs in the medium and long term through integrated infrastructural investment.</P>
    <P>Increased availability of land for housing needs is to be accompanied by optimal use of that scarce resource. Increased residential density is crucial in this regard in promoting sustainable development, helping to prevent further urban sprawl and promoting greater efficiency in public transport and other public services. Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála were asked to implement the Planning Guidelines on Housing Densities when these were issued in draft form earlier this year. They will now be required under law to have regard to the definitive guidelines which were published last week following a process of public consultation.</P>
    <P>Increased residential densities have an important role to play in supporting the provision of affordable housing. The local authority affordable housing scheme, which I launched last March, is an important new initiative to help bridge the affordability gap for aspiring house purchasers. It is directly linked to the delivery of <Col N="889" /> additional new houses by local authorities and, therefore, will not adversely affect house prices. A substantial number of these houses are already in the pipeline and some will be ready later this year. I expect that some 1,400 homes will be provided under the scheme by the end of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Capital investment in the local authority housing programme is at its highest ever level. This allocation was significantly increased by the Government well in advance of the needs assessment being undertaken. The £230 million being provided for the local authority housing programme this year represents an increase of almost £35 million on the 1998 provision. The capital provision for this programme is now four times greater than that provided in 1993 and I have secured increases of 18 per cent in each of the past two years. The high level of funding will enable local authorities to meet commitments in their ongoing programmes and to fund the enhanced programme of 4,500 new starts in 1999, the highest number in 13 years. The substantially increased capital provision for this year is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to local authority housing as the mainstay of the overall response to social housing needs. Lest anyone be in doubt that £230 million is the extent of the Government's investment in housing, the total investment by Government in all the housing programmes is £520 million this year alone.</P>
    <P>The Government has advanced further in this regard and I have introduced a new multi-annual local authority housing programme of 22,000 houses over the next four years. This is clearly an ambitious programme but one which is designed to deliver quality housing in a good environment suited to the needs of tenants.</P>
    <P>At my request local authorities have already set in train the necessary forward planning process and have started making preparations for their multi-annual programmes. This includes the assembly of necessary land banks to meet their needs over the coming years. It is open to local authorities to acquire lands by way of compulsory purchase order if this is what is required to secure lands. My Department has also held a series of regional workshops recently with key personnel in local authorities to emphasise the need to accelerate local authority housing output over the next four years.</P>
    <P>What all this means is that I will, this month, allocate starts for the next four years and it will then be a matter for each authority to proceed with their four year programme which will be agreed with the Department. The funding profile agreed with the Department will secure the necessary financial commitment for each authority's programme. I am confident the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with output from the complementary social and affordable housing measures, including voluntary housing, along with vacancies occurring in existing houses, will provide accommodation <Col N="890" /> for over 50,000 households during the coming four years.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme also plays an important part in the regeneration of urban areas. The most prominent example is Ballymun where the development of new housing is central to the social and economic regeneration of the area as a whole. The funding which has been provided this year to get the redevelopment under way is concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to improve the housing and economic prospects of an area in Dublin that has regrettably been neglected over the years. The previous Government provided no funding whatever for this major redevelopment. It may have approved the proposal in principle but it did not provide funding. The Government is committed to providing £350 million for the regeneration of Ballymun over the coming years. This clearly marks out our commitment to a project that is unique in terms of Irish social housing and in terms of the comprehensive scale and level of funding. The lessons of the past have showed that a planned and integrated development is essential to the success of a regeneration project and I look forward to advancing the comprehensive redevelopment of Ballymun.</P>
    <P>We are also determined to maintain maximum progress under the remedial works programme throughout the country which continues to provide practical assistance to local authorities to improve the standards of inadequate housing and assist in the rehabilitation of run down estates.</P>
    <P>Although local authorities have traditionally been the dominant force in social housing provision, the voluntary housing sector has made an important contribution to alleviate social housing need. However, the increased cost of construction experienced in recent years put output under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme at serious risk. On becoming Minister, I was determined to ensure increased social housing provision and my commitment to this scheme has been demonstrated in practice through increasing the limits of assistance twice within a one year period. Since the inception of the scheme these represented the most significant increase &ndash; up to 67 per cent &ndash; in the level of funding. These increases have arrested the decline in voluntary housing output and I am glad to note at this stage it appears likely that voluntary housing output in 1999 will be around 50 per cent higher than output last year.</P>

      <P>I recognise that more financial supports for the development of the voluntary housing sector are necessary. I have received detailed proposals from the Irish Council for Social Housing and the National Association of Building Co-operatives for the planned expansion of the voluntary housing sector. This sector has the capacity, with proper support, to add significantly to its current contribution to meet social <Col N="891" /> housing needs, particularly special housing needs which the sector has catered for so admirably. My efforts will be directed towards facilitating the voluntary housing sector in increasing its output over the coming years. I have also reminded local authorities to renew their efforts to respond to housing needs in their own areas by developing to the full the potential of the range of social and voluntary housing measures now available to them to supplement their local authority housing programmes. I am confident local authorities will respond positively.</P>
      <P>The Government has also taken the initiative of establishing a cross-Department team on homelessness with the remit of preparing an integrated response to the issues which affect homeless people, including accommodation, health, education and employment. Submissions from a cross-section of the statutory and voluntary agencies involved, including local authorities and health boards, have been received and I expect that the cross-Department team will finalise its report in the near future.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is not just about a lack of accommodation. We must provide the necessary support services to enable homeless people to get out of the cycle of homelessness. Increasingly, voluntary bodies are providing settlement services, with funding provided by the Government, to assist homeless people to move into and adjust to an independent lifestyle. This is an objective I strongly support and I would point out that in this year's budget we provided for the very first &lsquo;foyer' for homeless persons. Foyers are specially designed to provide accommodation and training opportunities for young homeless persons and are an important element in the comprehensive response to homelessness.</P>
      <P>The local authority housing programme I am promoting is fundamentally different in character from that of previous decades. A key policy consideration is to provide housing in a manner which does not contribute to or reinforce social segregation. Local authorities are providing housing in small, well-designed schemes, often on infill sites and without recourse, as in the past, to building large estates on greenfield sites at the edges of our cities and towns. This approach is crucial in redeveloping rundown areas of our towns and cities and providing a quality environment for residents, especially older or disabled people.</P>
      <P>I said that a significant proportion of the households on waiting lists were one parent households and 17,000 households consist of one adult and one or more children; approximately 11,000 of those households consist of one adult and one child only. Bearing this in mind, it is of crucial importance to ensure that new housing by local authorities is fully integrated into the full range of social and community supports and backup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined some of the actions being taken by the Government across the social housing <Col N="892" /> spectrum. Of course I acknowledge that problems exist. However, the Government has taken real and positive steps to address these problems and will continue to do so over the coming years. A range of factors including rapid economic growth, growth in employment and in immigration together with social and demographic changes have placed our entire housing system under extraordinary and unprecedented pressure. Relative to our population we are building more new houses and at a faster rate than any other European country.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that we continue at this high level and that the needs of the weakest sectors of our community are adequately addressed through our local authority and social housing programmes. I commend the Government amendment of the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the names of the Members of the Labour Party states:</P>
      <P>In the first paragraph, after the words &ldquo;calls on the Government to:&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;commence a front-loaded social and local authority house building programme for 50,000 dwellings and that this programme be reviewed annually;</P>
      <P>&ndash;authorise each local authority to assemble a land bank, by compulsory purchase order if necessary, which would be sufficient to meet the need for building land for local authority housing, voluntary sector housing and affordable private housing;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal finally published the national housing figures, six months after the assessment was completed, and published today only because of parliamentary questions this afternoon and this debate tonight. Tomorrow's headlines, carefully spun by the Minister of State's media handlers, who have been more successful in building his reputation and that of his colleague, Deputy Dempsey, than they have been in building houses, will probably tell the nation that there are 39,000 on the housing waiting lists. The Minister's reply to my questions in the House this afternoon tells us there are an additional 6,000 considered suitable for other social housing measures, bringing the figure to 45,000, but if we look more closely at the document issued by the Minister, we find that the real figure is even higher again. In fact, taking all housing needs together, the total figure of those on local authority housing lists in March 1999 was 50,715. There it is, at the bottom of table 1. It is not 39,000 at all; it is 50,715, the number included in <Col N="893" /> the assessment &ndash; that is the total, including the number suited to social housing, the number suited to social welfare supplementary allowance, the numbers resident in overcrowded and materially unsuitable local authority housing, the number included in other local authority housing assessment, the number of travellers suited to caravan parks and the net approved need. That is the total &ndash; 50,715, not the deducted figure the Minister quoted today in the House.</P>
    <P>If anything, this huge, unprecedented figure is an understatement of the overall housing need because the figures are now six months old and in that six month period the picture has worsened. I know, for example, that in my local authority area of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, the current number on the housing list is approximately 400 more than last March and if that pattern is repeated throughout the country, the figures published today may be understating the real size of the housing waiting list by as much as 20 per cent. However, officially the list stands at 50,715 on local authority waiting lists. At a time of unprecedented prosperity, this is a cause of shame for the Government. That the number of homeless should have doubled in the lifetime of this Government with the enormous financial resources available to the State is a cause for scandal.</P>
    <P>These are the worst housing figures in living memory, but they are only figures. Behind every one of those 50,000 there is a story of human need &ndash; the young couple living in the tiny box room of his mother's council home with three children aged under five and space so scarce that the week old baby has to sleep on the floor; the woman who is evicted from her private flat after 13 years tenancy and who has to turn to the local authority for housing; the man who suffers from a serious heart problem and whose two daughters, each with her own two children, are sharing the three bedroomed family home with parents, an adult brother and an adult sister; the families who are paying huge rent for private accommodation in which they have no security of tenure, etc., and I could go on.</P>
    <P>Everybody on the housing list has a real and pressing need for housing. They cannot afford to buy and they cannot afford to continue to live as they are. They need to be housed. The response from this Government, however, is not only inadequate but is cruel and deceptive. The Minister of State's speech was particularly unhelpful and unsympathetic to those on the housing lists. The speech refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem. It is a speech about downplaying the problem and downplaying the numbers on the housing lists. It is playing up the Government's so-called initiatives and rubbishing the idea that 10,000 houses are required each year. Then, in a disingenuous aside one could only expect from a Minister of State whose party leader told single parents they should stay at home with their parents, he twice drew attention to the number of lone parents on the local authority housing lists <Col N="894" /> as if to imply that somehow they do not have a real housing need.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government has failed those on the housing lists. This is the Government whose present Tánaiste told the people during the last general election that single parents should be living at home with their mothers. She has been true to her word because her Government and her Minister of State have done nothing to house them independently. This is the Government which, up to the beginning of this year, was insisting there was no housing crisis at all, just as they would now have us believe that the crisis is now under control.</P>
    <P>House prices are stabilising we are told, even though house prices will rise by approximately 25 per cent in 1999. The new planning Bill will provide land for social housing we are told, even though it will not take effect for at least three years. Today, the Minister of State proclaims there will be increased social housing output over the next four years which will meet the needs of over 50,000 households, but if we look a little closer at his programme we find his aspiration is empty.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's plan is to provide 4,500 houses this year. This is a pathetic contribution against a list of 50,000 applicants. In any event, the 4,500 target will not be achieved. In each of the past five years, the actual supply of local authority houses has fallen far short of the allocation originally announced. Last year, for example, only 2,778 local authority houses were completed, even though the announcement for house starts was approximately 3,500.</P>

      <P>When we were in Government there were half as many people on the local authority housing waiting list, people could afford to buy a home and we did not have the housing crisis we have now. The worst thing to happen to people on the housing list was the change of Government in June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only 485 voluntary sector houses were completed last year. The Minister says he intends to increase this to 4,000 <i>per annum</i> over the coming years but so far he has not told us how he is going to achieve this. The reality is that, at best, only half of the 50,000 people on the housing list will have their needs met under the Minister of State's plans. The Labour Party has studied the housing crisis and produced the only comprehensive analysis of the problem in its totality, in the report of the housing commission chaired by Professor P. J. Drudy of Trinity College, Dublin. The only way to meet the housing needs of the 50,000 on the waiting list is to build and provide 50,000 social and local authority houses, and the Minister of State and the Government should now decide to provide those additional homes. Local authorities should be empowered to acquire the necessary land, by compulsory purchase if neces<Col N="895" /> sary, to begin designing the housing schemes, to prepare the tender documents and to start construction. Building homes takes time, from conception to construction. Why wait to begin the work of designing and building the 50,000 homes which we already know are needed to meet the requirements of the 50,000 on the housing list? I agree with one aspect of the Minister of State's approach to the housing problem, namely, the need to change to a multi-annual housing programme. However, he is making a mistake in delaying the introduction of this programme until next year, and the 22,000 he intends to provide through it is less than half the number required.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State took issue with the desirability of local authorities providing 10,000 new homes in each of the next four years. The approach suggested by the Labour Party is justified by the numbers on the housing list. It is also justified by an article by Dr. Tony Fahy of the ESRI in the current issue of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i>. Dr. Fahy points out that local authority house building has always been a major feature of Irish housing provision. To date, local authorities have built some 330,000 dwellings, 30 per cent of the present housing stock. Since 1987, social housing construction has consistently fallen below 10 per cent of total new housing construction, in contrast with levels in the range of 20 to 30 per cent, which were the long-term norms in the decades prior to the late 1980s. He concludes that we will need a four-fold increase in social housing output over the next decade compared to the past decade.</P>
    <P>Dr. Fahy draws attention to the implicit rule of thumb in Irish housing policy over most of the past century, that between one quarter and one third of new households require accommodation provided by local authorities or through some form of social housing. There is no reason to believe that this need has lessened. The current state of house prices suggests the proportion might now be higher. Young professionals such as teachers were always able to buy their own homes until now. If we are to apply the home loan criteria explained to us by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey &ndash; two and a half times the principal earnings plus the subsidiary earnings &ndash; two teachers on salaries of £25,000 and £20,000 respectively would be unable to buy a starter home in the greater Dublin area at present. The logic of this position is that there must be a phenomenal increase in the provision of public and social housing. The price of the Government's failure will have to be paid in huge increases in public expenditure to provide public and social housing.</P>
    <P>The increased housing output to which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, so often refers may be meeting demand from those with the spare cash to buy an extra apartment in downtown Dublin or a seaside holiday home in Kilkee, but it is clearly not meeting the housing need of those currently frozen out of the market. Last <Col N="896" /> year, for example, total housing output was over 42,000 but only slightly more than 3,000 housing units, less than 8 per cent of the total, was made up of local authority and voluntary housing, a far cry from the 25 to 30 per cent which Dr. Fahy estimates is required.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, the ESRI estimates that 500,000 new dwellings will be needed in Ireland over the next ten years or so. If 25 to 30 per cent of these will need to be provided for young families who will be unable to buy, then between 125,000 and 150,000 social and local authority housing units will be needed over the next decade. Set against this enormous requirement, a major kick-start must be given to the social and public housing programme. The Labour Party says we must start a programme to build 50,000 houses. Local authorities must be empowered to secure the land on which to build these houses.</P>
    <P>If necessary, our housing structures and the system of administering and managing our public housing programme may have to be reformed to deliver on this requirement. Responsibility for delivering our housing needs will have to be met by a specially established national housing authority and the housing services currently provided by local authorities and health boards, which are currently unco-ordinated, must be drawn together into local housing authorities, extending responsibility not only for the building and provision of the social and public housing programme, but also for the supervision of the private rented sector and the acquisition and delivery of land for private sector housing to be built at an affordable price.</P>
    <P>The need to provide additional local authority housing is only part of the solution to this problem, which must be examined in its totality. There is a need to provide not only additional social and public housing but protection for tenants in private rented accommodation. There has been an increase in the number of people meeting their housing needs by renting privately. Unfortunately, this is the only country in Europe where a landlord is free to put up the rent as often as he likes, whenever he likes, to whatever level he likes, on accommodation in which the tenant has no security of tenure. We need legislation to provide protection for tenants in the private rented sector and to regulate the relationship between landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>We also need to ensure the continuing escalation of house prices is brought under control. So far, the Government has failed to do this. The measures announced are not succeeding. The Bacon measures did not succeed &ndash; there was a temporary respite from investment buying in the private housing market but it only lasted for a few months. The proposals in the planning Bill, which we will debate later this year, will not meet requirements because they will not kick in for at least three years. We need from this Government a comprehensive national housing strategy, something we have not had to date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> However, we will get that only if the Government accepts that we have a serious housing crisis which will not be met by market means alone and that talking up the Minister's actions and talking down the problem will not resolve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the most pressing social issue in Irish society. I am aware of the importance of local authority housing because in the late 1950's and early 1960's my family was lucky enough to be housed by Westmeath County Council. All my political life I have campaigned solidly and fearlessly for a significant increase in the building of local authority houses. I remember &ndash; there are some people here who may have forgotten &ndash; the dark days of the 1980s when hundreds of people were on the housing list in Westmeath and thousands were on housing lists across the country. Those people were victims of the savage cutbacks in public expenditure. We know now there may have been other reasons for the cutbacks, but I unashamedly championed the cause of those people who were condemned to live in mobile homes, caravans and other forms of dangerous accommodation. People with six and eight children were living in mobile homes. I pledged that when the Labour Party returned to Government &ndash; I was delighted when it did, in coalition with Fianna Fáil &ndash; it would restore a commitment to build local authority housing, which was forgotten about in the rush to satisfy other vested interests in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>In the past two years house prices have increased. Local authority housing waiting lists and rents in the private sector have spiralled out of control. The Government response to this crisis, which is causing untold hardship to thousands of families, as has been documented by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, has been partial and ineffective. I have no doubt that a central plank in achieving a sustained decrease in local housing lists is a strong commitment to public expenditure. It worries me that the commitment may well be only half-hearted. It comes down to pounds, shillings and pence. In this time of plenty there is no excuse, other than a lack of commitment, for failure to ensure that people are awarded their constitutional right to decent accommodation. It is the duty, responsibility and obligation of the Government to ensure sufficient funding is given to local authorities to build a significant number of local authority houses. In the first instance they should be given money to acquire a significant land bank and service sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The serviced land initiative was all right for the private sectors, but the same commitment needs to be given to local authorities so they can service available land. They should be given power to sell those sites, perhaps at a subsidised rate, to some of those on the housing list. There is a new poor on housing lists. Once, those on housing lists were people like my family, county council workers, the unemployed and those on disability benefit. Now teachers are thinking about going on the <Col N="898" /> housing list because, as Deputy Gilmore accurately pointed out, they cannot afford to purchase a house for the first time. The same applies to couples on what, five or six years ago, we would have called comfortable salaries.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the Government's failure to tackle the housing crisis is that it sees the issue as purely economic. The two major reports from Dr. Peter Bacon highlight this &ndash; both are entitled An Economic Assessment of the Housing Market. Housing is more than a matter of economics and any political response to the housing crisis must recognise this. Housing is a social and political right because without housing a citizen cannot vindicate his or her other rights enshrined in the Constitution. Without decent housing people cannot raise their families in security. The Labour Party's housing commission report recognises this fact. I compliment Deputy Gilmore for the trojan work he and his colleagues have undertaken in the past year in publishing one of the most progressive, far-reaching and profound reports on housing that has ever been produced.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party firmly believes that local authority housing must play a central role in the current housing crisis. During the 1980s and early 1990s the local authority house building programme practically ground to a halt. It is now apparent that while social investment programmes were severely cut back, some of the wealthiest were salting their money away in foreign accounts with the intention of evading their social obligation to pay the tax they owed. When this money is recovered, I hope whatever Government is in power will ensure that those who paid most for those cutbacks will be the first to gain. Ensuring significant investment in public housing is one of the best ways of achieving this goal.</P>
    <P>With every new public housing initiative we should learn from the mistakes of the past. Too often public housing units have been built in isolation. Sometimes we have not given proper thought to providing the facilities and services a community needs. We must never repeat these mistakes. In fairness, this has been grasped by local authorities in building new houses. Recreational facilities, green spaces, decent public transport and well resourced estate management initiatives are as important to the success of local authority houses as the bricks and mortar used in their construction.</P>
    <P>Some people used to look at local authority houses as a second rate form of housing. However, that was often because no services were provided. I am delighted the houses being built by local authorities now are some of the best in the country. However, we should ensure that when we build social housing units, they are the basis of real community life.</P>
    <P>In common with every other local authority, the housing list in Westmeath County Council continues to grow each month, with more than 500 on the list. However, throughout Westmeath <Col N="899" /> derelict cottages and houses litter the landscape. I know many young couples who cannot afford to buy a home of their own. I cannot understand why an initiative which would encourage the renovation of derelict houses has not been established so young couples will be given the opportunity to raise their families in the locality where they grew up. This is an important point to which I have a strong and profound commitment. Depopulation is threatening the future of dozens of rural communities while at the same time urban areas are chock-a-block and there are deficits in services, transport and other infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There are houses scattered throughout rural areas. As I previously suggested, a £15,000 grant should be introduced which would not be for the wealthy or those fat cats who did not pay their taxes but for ordinary people who could purchase these houses. They would have to commit to living in an area for a minimum of seven years. If they left before than time, a proportional amount of the grant would have to be repaid. All grant applicants would be subject to income qualifying criteria to assess whether they had a genuine need for grant assistance and a maximum income of £25,000 would apply. The rural areas which would benefit from such a targeted scheme would be clearly identified by examining the decrease in population experienced between the 1991 and 1996 census of population. An imaginative renovation grant scheme would introduce new housing stock for the market, add new lifeblood to rural Ireland and remove the eyesore of derelict buildings from the landscape. This is not the first time I have raised this matter in the House and I have yet to receive a positive response.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention a category of people who no one seems to mention as regards housing. These are middle-aged people from 35 to 50 years who for whatever reason live alone. They often have to live in the worst private rented accommodation available. Their names are on the housing list but in reality there is no chance of them being provided with housing.</P>

      <P>During the summer all major community projects and many major jobs initiatives were faced with the unilateral prospect of their numbers being cut by almost 5,000 by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, without any discussion with the social partners or reference to the standing committee on employment under Partnership 2000. A clear effort was made to reduce the resources available for measures to assist the unemployed to get sustainable jobs. It is clear the Minister was <Col N="900" /> taking advantage of the current jobs climate to implement the Deloitte &amp; Touche report which advocated the reduction of community employment places to less than 30,000, to increase the age eligibility and to restructure the programme in such a way that many of those who now avail of the scheme would be disadvantaged. When thousands of community employment workers marched past Dáil Éireann in recent weeks they were angry at the arrogant behaviour of the Minister and her Department.</P>
      <P>It cannot be denied that the growth of the social economy has been facilitated and sustained by community employment over the past ten to 12 years. The initiative began in the mid 1980s when Deputy Quinn introduced SES. Many important local groups, such as development centres, small enterprise centres and unemployment centres, panicked when they were faced with the major difficulty of carrying on the valuable work they have done for our community over the past decade. Many primary and secondary schools were faced with great uncertainty, particularly in relation to school secretaries and other part-time workers such as caretakers and school assistants. It was difficult for principals to plan the programmes they would adopt in the 1999-2000 school year. However, none of this was heeded by the Minister. Despite a promise of 5,000 jobs during the discussions on the national development plan, consultation did not take place until last week when the Minister realised this issue would be raised in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As a director of an unemployment centre and a development centre, which employs more than 100 community employment workers at different times and has a good record in the northside partnership area of Dublin of placing those workers in long-term sustainable employment, I agree that the progression rates and individual development plans for those workers is an important aspect of the programme's development in the future and for advancing specific skills training and increasing the range of employment foundation courses. The Minister was ill advised in unilaterally reducing this programme.</P>
      <P>A few weeks before the Dáil broke for the summer, Deputy Deenihan and I spoke about the future of the partnership companies. We wanted to know what would happen to the community developments after 1 January 2000. Workers played an important role in these developments through training or community employment. We felt the prospect for these projects was bleak as many of the senior staff who had implemented the programmes at local level were moving to different areas of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently met a delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and backed down on the worst aspects of her plan. I suggest that if she wants to develop this programme and look at ways in which it can be more closely linked with an active labour market programme, she should consult the workers, their representatives in the trade union movement and their <Col N="901" /> employers and sponsorship groups. The Minister has behaved in a disgraceful and unilateral way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss in the House the restructuring of community employment and to provide further clarification of the changes approved by the Government last July on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. The programme was introduced in 1994 to replace a range of then existing initiatives. At its height, it operated at a level of approximately 40,000 participants.</P>
      <P>In a tightening labour market, continuation of an active labour market programme at this level had to be examined and the Government took a decision in July 1997 which led to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on community employment which was published in September 1998. The main recommendations of that report were to reduce the number of places, improve targeting and progression, limit rollover by participants, review the participation level by lone parents and discontinue community employment within the State sector because of poor progression rates. The key considerations behind these proposals were poor labour market assimilation following community employment, poor targeting notwithstanding recent reforms, excessive carouselling, poor links to the open labour market and increasing numbers of lone parents not progressing from community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended cuts of between 6,000 and 8,000 places in community employment and this figure was the basis of discussions with the social partners on restructuring the community employment programme. The details of the restructuring should be restated so that there is no confusion in the House. The eligibility age has been raised from 21 to 25 with the exception of discretionary referrals under the employment action programme; the waiting period for individuals repeating a one year term is increased from six months to one year; lifetime participation in community employment by an individual is capped at three years; the numbers on community employment will be reduced from 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 over a period of five years through transferring the resources for 5,000 places to the dedicated social economy programme and by reducing the numbers of places otherwise on the programme by 4,500; and eligibility has been extended to additional categories, namely, qualified adults and widows and widowers, subject to a qualifying period for eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> In tandem with these changes, the Government has also approved the phasing in of a dedicated social economy programme with effect from 1999 and the establishment of a national monitoring committee to oversee the operation of this programme. The primary focus of this programme will be on the development and regeneration of disadvantaged communities and it arose from consultations with the social partners. The national monitoring committee is currently being established to oversee this programme.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the community employment programme will effectively refocus the programme on older persons and those most removed from the labour market and diminish the extent to which community employment might be seen as competing with the open labour market for employees who are job ready. The shift must be taken in tandem with budgetary changes announced earlier this year which saw 11,000 new places introduced costing £22.85 million and covering a range of topics from specific skills training through enhanced jobs clubs provision to an additional 800 flexible training places for lone parents.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of community employment also opens up access in their own right to additional categories of disadvantaged persons in the State, that is, qualified adults who are long-term employed, and removes the anomaly whereby widows and widowers who want to return to work could not avail of community employment to facilitate a return to the jobs market. Community employment will remain a substantial active labour market initiative, albeit more focused on the most needy and hardest to place in the labour market. The programme will continue to support the community and statutory sector, if at a reduced level. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently met representatives of the INOU and ICTU and already provided full clarification of the restructuring along these lines.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the details of the Government decision and the reasoning behind it, the House must contextualise it. Unemployment has fallen from 179,000 in 1996 to 95,000, that is, from 11.8 per cent to 5.9 per cent. Long-term unemployment has fallen in the same period from 103,000 to 44,000, that is, from 6.8 per cent to 2.6 per cent. In that period 29,400 additional net places directed at the socially excluded have been provided in employment, training and educational programmes. The Government has fulfilled by a factor of three the commitment in paragraph 4.24 of Partnership 2000 to provide 10,000 additional active labour market places. The ratio of community employment places to long-term unemployment has dropped from 2.6:1 in 1996 to 1.1:1 today.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the restructuring of community employment has been well thought out and the Government's decision has been taken in the best interests of the most needy <Col N="903" /> groups in society. I commend the Government decision to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to this debate. For over ten years, the south Galway drainage action committee of the IFA has campaigned vigorously to have this problem resolved. It has had umpteen meetings with various Ministers of respective Governments, all to no avail, with one exception. The time for delaying tactics is over.</P>
      <P>There were long delays following the bad flooding of 1991, which was repeated in 1994 and 1995 and which resulted in the commissioning by the Office of Public Works of a report on the flooding of south Galway undertaken by Dr. Peech. Further delays were caused by the requirement of a cost benefit analysis immediately afterwards. Despite all these delays, the Minister has made no commitments in the last two and a half years. On 20 May last, the Minister met a committee representing the action group and the public representatives from east Galway. He gave undertakings then that he would investigate through the Office of Public Works certain minor remedial schemes that could be undertaken at very low cost.</P>
      <P>We saw the commitment of the previous Government in the provision of funding for a low cost scheme which had tremendous positive results in the area of Kilterrnan. The committee pointed out to the Minister that such other remedial works could be undertaken at a very low cost. However, the Minister has sat on the report and all the information available to him and done nothing. There are four Ministers of State from County Galway in the Government but where is the Government's commitment to the people of south Galway if the four Ministers of State cannot ask the Minister of State to deliver remedial drainage and flood alleviation plans at a very low cost?</P>
      <P>The problem which recurred after only 48 hours of heavy rain a fortnight ago is another indication of how serious the problem is becoming. The problem does not only have natural causes. It has been exacerbated by reafforestation which has recreated drainage on the mountains and allowed water to flow freely down into the area, particularly around Kilchreest and Roxborough. Refurbishment of a half mile stretch and the removal of rock along 50 to 100 metres would divide the water of the Roxborough river, sending part of it down to what is known locally at The Seven Eye Bridge and the rest into the Aggard river. This would not involve an insurmountable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Termon, the Minister gave undertakings to the committee on the day they met that he would get the Office of Public Works to investigate the possibility of diverting the flood waters away to Kilmacdough. I do not know what is <Col N="904" /> available to the Minister in terms of information because he has kept it to himself. When the Minister visited south Galway last June, he was accompanied by the Minister of State from east Galway who was seeking election to the European Parliament and turning his back on the people of south Galway. Alas, he is still a Member of the House and must face the music. He failed the people once more by failing to get away.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to name a date on which he will authorise the start of these flood alleviation works or will he condemn indefinitely the people of south Galway to hardship? The only solution that has come forward is resettlement in this area, which could create a paradise for botanists and ecologists in the region. If the Minister wants to preside over such a situation, he should say so; otherwise, he should state how much money he will provide for these remedial drainage works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for giving me this opportunity to inform the House of the up to date position regarding the three minor schemes, namely Termon flood alleviation scheme, Mannin Cross flood alleviation scheme and the Culvert Sites. As the Deputy said, earlier this year I visited south Galway and saw the areas in question at first hand. Before progressing further it is appropriate to recap briefly on what has happened to date regarding the flooding problems in south Galway since late 1994/early 1995 when the heavy flooding occurred.</P>
      <P>In August 1995 the Government commissioned a major multi-disciplinary study of the problem with the following objectives: to define the current flooding problem; to define the hydrological/hydrogeological processes; to assess the effects of climate change; to quantitatively define the flood hazard in terms of land inundated for specific return periods, economic value and social implications; to quantify and rank the environmental importance and economic value of the various wetlands; to propose engineering solutions in terms of relative alleviation of risk and evaluate their economic costs and social and environmental implications and to evaluate the economic and social impacts of non-technical issues/proposals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the final report was published at the end of May 1998 and it was discussed at a public meeting in Gort in July 1998 which was attended by the various experts who helped to compile it and also by officials of the Office of Public Works. I responded to a similar Adjournment Debate on this subject on 3 June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the main recommendations derived from the conclusions of the study and contained in the final report are that detailed studies should be carried out with regard to the implementation of peripheral engineering schemes at the Culvert Sites, Mannin Cross and Termon; rainfall and river flows, turloughs and groundwater levels <Col N="905" /> should be monitored for a further three year period to clarify the value of currently used rainfall and flood return periods for engineering design and to increase confidence of model calibration and validation and that the design and calibration of all models should be updated and refined with further inputs and the models used to study the effects of floods of differing magnitudes.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, the report indicated that three small peripheral engineering schemes at the Culvert Sites, Mannin Cross and Termon could be implemented if detailed, environmental and economic assessments confirmed viability. I gave assurances, and issued instructions accordingly, that every effort should be made to assess the viability of these three schemes as soon as was practicable. That was part of the reason I visited south Galway a few months ago. In March this year the Commissioners of Public Works appointed consulting engineers to examine again in detail the three areas outlined. The reports have recently been finalised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Culvert construction and clearance works, the consultants concluded that &ldquo;as no housing, industrial or commercial developments of any value lay within the floodplain area to benefit from the proposed works at these sites, the economic benefits arising following project implementation would be limited to the maintenance of existing agricultural development.&rdquo;  In essence, the capital costs of the scheme works would far outweigh any benefits to be derived.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mannin Cross, the consultants found that using standard accepted methods of economic assessment and the estimated return periods for the flooding, the costs of the works would again far outweigh the benefits to be derived from the works. It was found that the 1994-95 flood, which the experts estimated as a one in 35 year event, would have to become a more frequent occurrence in order to justify this scheme on economic grounds.</P>
    <P>The consultants, having examined proposals for alleviation of flooding in the Termon area, considered that on balance it was not possible to definitively promote a scheme which only had a neutral cost benefit analysis and which had particular negative environmental impacts. The Deputy is aware of these.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the examination, as I stated in response to Parliamentary Question No. 409 on Wednesday last week, shows that there is not a cost beneficial solution in any of the cases regardless of environmental considerations based on a flood return period of one in 35 years.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the south Galway flood study, arrangements are in place to monitor closely all water levels at key locations within the study area to increase the confidence of model calibration and validation. If this continued, monitoring should demonstrate changes in the climate cycle or in the return period of the flood event of 1994-95, the assumptions which <Col N="906" /> underpin the model and its cost benefit analysis can be revisited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge receipt of information sought in my Parliamentary Question No. 401 of 29 September which I received from the Minister for Finance, dated 4 October 1999. I thank the Minister for Finance and the Secretary General of his Department for the assistance, co-operation and courtesy they afforded me with respect to this matter. They have acted with the utmost probity at all times.</P>
      <P>However, having examined the information supplied and various correspondence on the matter, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would address the following points with respect to the file outlining the facts surrounding the disposal of 93 Merrion Square to the Irish Intercontinental Bank in 1987. In a letter to the Minister for Finance from the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, dated 4 October 1999, Deputy Cullen states in the second paragraph;</P>
      <P>I am entirely satisfied that I and my office acted with propriety at all stages. No verbal or written communication was issued to anyone outside appropriate official contacts.</P>
      <P>Does this include or exclude the <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> journalist, Mairead Carey, who visited the Office of Public Works at 51, St. Stephen's Green on the afternoon of Friday, 1 October 1999 to read the file on 93 Merrion Square in the presence of two Office of Public Works officials and what definition does the Minister of State's Department give to &ldquo;appropriate official contacts&ldquo;? Was there a requirement for Ms Carey, under the Freedom of Information Act, to apply for the information in writing and, if so, was this done and at what time?</P>
      <P>With respect to the other matters raised in the correspondence, what was the extent of the information brought to the attention of the Taoiseach's office? Was the relevant file or parts thereof sent to the Taoiseach's office? If so, when was it sent and how long did it remain there? To whom in the Taoiseach's office was the information addressed? How was it delivered and by whom and to whom was it delivered? Who made the media queries to the Department of the Taoiseach? How were these queries made? Who responded to them? Could the Minister of State give the name of the official who responded to them? What was contained in the response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most importantly, did the person who gave the briefing feel it necessary, at a later date, to tell that person or persons briefed to go to the Office of Public Works to look at information that they may already have seen somewhere in the Taoiseach's office in order to cover their tracks? Who in the Taoiseach's office was aware of the information? Why was the information involved in this parliamentary question sent to an official who was unfamiliar with the procedure of parliamen<Col N="907" /> tary questions, as stated by the Taoiseach on today's Order of Business?</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State cannot answer all my queries this evening, I would be grateful if he would furnish me with the answers at a later date. Does the Minister of State's Department and the Government intend to issue a directive to Members of the Oireachtas and journalists outlining the circumstances when they can have immediate access to Department files and what procedures need to be followed?</P>
    <P>I simply wish to get to the truth of this sordid affair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for raising this matter and I welcome the opportunity to deal with it directly in the House. The Deputy raised a number of questions outside the specific question he put down this evening but I will try to deal with them. However, I will answer the specific question first.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers asked the Minister for Finance if his Department disposed of any assets or property with a value of or greater than £200,000 between 1987 and 1992 inclusive, without going to public tender; if so, if the Minister would give details and circumstances of these sales and the reason for the decision not to go to tender.</P>
      <P>The reply required information on property and assets. Property information was a matter for the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works provided draft material to the Department of Finance which stated that 14 properties with a value in excess of £200,000 had been disposed of by it in the relevant period. All but three of these had been disposed of to other State bodies in accordance with the normal procedures governing disposals between State organisations. These were Chantilly Lands, which was a direct sale to the county council for road development relating to the Shankhill to Bray by-pass and south east motorway, and 73 Lower Baggot Street, a direct sale to the Health Research Board who had been the occupiers of the premises for the previous 20 years.</P>
      <P>The remaining disposal was of 93 Merrion Square to the Irish Intercontinental Bank following an approach to the Department of Finance by the bank, which owned the adjoining properties and wished to expand its business with a consequential increase in employment. Having regard to, first, the fact that the bank's offer of £250,000 for the property was £30,000 to £35,000 above our estimation of its market value and, second, the job creating aspect of the proposed acquisition by the bank, Department of Finance sanction was obtained. The material on file shows that the then Minister, Deputy John Bruton, took advice from officials when he decided to allow the sale of the building without it going through the normal tender procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, information on property was a matter for the Office of Public Works. Infor<Col N="908" /> mation on assets was a matter for the Department of Finance. That information could not be assembled in time on 29 September. The Department of Finance decided in the circumstances to issue an interim reply to the parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record that, as I have already stated, both I and the Office of Public Works acted with propriety in handling the reply to Deputy Timmins's parliamentary question. The reply was processed in my office in the normal way. The material was approved, unaltered by me, and sent to the Department of Finance for inclusion in the composite reply. Neither I nor the Office of Public Works was involved in any way in the decision to issue a holding reply.</P>
    <P>I will deal with Deputy Timmins's comments. I would have appreciated if he had acknowledged that the Office of Public Works prepared the question. It was ready for issue last week and had been sent for issue. There was no reticence on the part of the Office of Public Works. We issued the question to the Department and that should be acknowledged in the good faith in which it was sent in to the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing this scheme. Over the past decade, the success of various urban renewal and seaside resort schemes in our larger towns has been evident. Obviously, there is a gap in the market for smaller towns. I was greatly interested in the Minister of State's proposals over the past 12 months for townscape schemes, which have been expanded in a similar way to urban renewal schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to their introduction throughout the country because they will work wonders for smaller towns. They will generate economic activity and create more jobs, but, most importantly, will preserve the finest aspects of many medium and small sized towns. I wish the Minister of State well in bringing the scheme to fruition. I was happy that the closing date for the scheme was put back to 31 December. The earlier deadline was causing difficulty at local authority <Col N="910" /> level. It was wise and fitting to extend it because it gives all of us who are involved in local authorities extra time to get our houses in order.</P>
    <P>My query relates to the number of towns in County Cork which are eligible for submission under the scheme. I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter last week and in his reply the Minister of State indicated that a formula was used to determine the number of towns which would be eligible in each county. According to that formula, most counties can submit up to 50 per cent of its eligible towns, but, unfortunately, County Cork can only submit approximately 33 per cent of its eligible towns. It is the only county with more than 20 eligible towns and I ask the Minister of State to consider allowing at least ten or possibly 12 towns to be included. The 33 per cent limit, as it applies to County Cork, is not good enough. Just because we have had recent success in the sporting field does not mean we will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Many of the county's towns would benefit tremendously from inclusion under this scheme. Seven towns is not enough for the largest county in Ireland. As 25 towns are eligible, it would be only fair and proper that ten to 12 towns be included by the Department. I do not ask the Minister of State to change the scheme or the formula used in it. I ask him to recognise that since Cork is the only county with more than 20 eligible towns, it should be allowed to submit more than seven towns for consideration as prescribed in his earlier document. He has shown flexibility with the deadline date and I ask him for extra flexibility for Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for allowing me to share time with him and I reiterate what he said. If County Cork were split in two, at least ten towns would be eligible for inclusion in the scheme and 15 towns would be disappointed. The scheme is worthwhile and I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing it. It will put the heart and soul back into small towns and improve their ambience and appearance. While I would like to see more towns included, I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on County Cork. Perhaps he will look at this issue again and not give us a definite &ldquo;no&rdquo; tonight. We would be happy if he agreed to re-examine the case for County Cork with a view to increasing the number of eligible towns to ten or 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to outline the background to the issue raised by Deputy Bradford. Last July I published detailed guidelines for the new town renewal scheme circulated to local authorities. These guidelines, which were intended to assist county councils in preparing town renewal plans, TRPs, for the purposes of the new scheme, identify more than 200 towns with a population of between 500 and 6,000. These are the population limits governing eligibility to participate in the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> The guidelines contain a formula which determines a number of towns which can be considered for designation during the first phase of the new scheme. Counties with fewer than six eligible towns can submit TRPs for a maximum of three, those with between six and ten can submit TRPs for four towns, those with between 11 and 20 can submit TRPs for five and those with more than 20 towns can submit TRPs for seven towns.</P>
    <P>County councils have been asked to submit plans to my Department on this basis. Cork is the only county with more than 20 eligible towns and, consequently, under the formula used in the guidelines, is the only county with an entitlement to submit seven plans. I am aware of the controversy which this proposal has created in County Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford and other public representatives have been arguing that Cork should have been given a higher allocation having regard to the limits set for other counties. However, in determining the number of towns per county for which plans were to be prepared, every effort was made to strike a balance between keeping the TRP process manageable while at the same time allowing councils to submit a reasonable number of plans for the first phase of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would stress that it is a phased scheme. Many of the towns in County Cork not selected initially <Col N="912" /> will be able to avail of the scheme in later phases. It will be the most widely spread urban renewal scheme ever introduced in this country, with in excess of 100 towns benefiting initially. It is also the first time that the Irish small town will have a chance to benefit from the tax incentive based approach which has transformed so many of the core areas of our larger urban areas.</P>
    <P>The drawing up of these plans places an onerous task on county councils and the councils will also have the job of promoting and implementing tax incentive schemes in the towns selected. This will be a sizeable undertaking for the councils. It would be undesirable to spread tax incentives too widely in the initial phase. Experience has shown that such schemes work most effectively when they are carefully targeted and when considerable effort is invested by the implementing agency which, in this case, is the county council. In the circumstances, I do not propose to alter the guidelines for the scheme.</P>
    <P>My main priority now is to get this much needed scheme up and running rather than get involved in a numbers game. We should now focus all our energies on getting this initial phase off to a successful start. We can review the situation following the receipt of plans by 31 December this year.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.12 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 October 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the overall EU commitment to stabilise CO2 emissions in the Union as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000, Ireland's CO2 Abatement Strategy of 1993 was based on the objective of limiting the growth in emissions to 20 per cent above 1990 levels in the year 2000. Recently prepared data from the EPA for 1997 indicate that CO2 emissions were 19.7 per cent over 1990 levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol, within the overall EU reduction target of 8 per cent, is to limit the net increase in emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-12. Revised data prepared by the EPA indicate that our net emissions of these gases reached the Kyoto level in 1997. EPA projections derived from official data suggest that under a business as usual scenario, emissions could increase by 26 per cent to 29.5 per cent by 2010.</P>
    <P>However, member states' targets were developed on the basis that they would represent a substantial reduction on business as usual scenarios, reflecting the emphasis across the EU on decoupling economic from emissions growth as the only realistic response to the threat of climate change.</P>
    <P>The Government will be taking the necessary action to ensure that Ireland meets the Kyoto target. A number of measures are already in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors. These are outlined in detail in Ireland's second national communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there have been a number of further policy developments which, <i>inter alia, </i>address climate change.</P>
    <P>For purposes of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet Ireland's Kyoto target, a consultancy study on the limitation and reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland was published by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise last year, and provided a basis for public consultation. Copies of the second national communication and the consultancy study are available in the Oireachtas Library. I have also established a consultation group on greenhouse gas emissions trading to assess the scope for domestic emissions trading and the implications for Ireland of an international trading regime. I understand that the group will be reporting shortly.</P>
    <P>The national strategy, now at an advanced stage of preparation having regard to public consultation, the evolution of negotiations on key elements of the protocol and continuing economic growth will provide a framework for achieving Ireland's Kyoto target. It will build on existing measures and identify additional policies and measures for implementation in all sectors in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner. Measures at national level will be complemented by further common and co-ordinated policies and measures across the EU.</P>

      <QRef>[18661/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency's report on Water Quality in Ireland 1995-97 states that the overall water quality situation in Lough Mask and Lough Corrib is satisfactory at present. This is based on the findings of monitoring programmes summarised in the EPA report and the preliminary results of detailed research projects. The report indicates that the status of Loughs Mask and Corrib has varied since 1976 between oligotrophic, unpol<Col N="916" /> luted, and mesotrophic, low probability of pollution, with only slight variations in quality over the periods 1995-97 compared to 1991-94. Both water quality classifications are regarded by the EPA as satisfactory and suitable for salmonid fisheries, abstractions for water supply and other pollution-sensitive uses. Loughs Corrib and Mask would also fall within the highest quality classification for lakes in the proposed EU framework directive on water policy.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated strategy to tackle all sources of nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication. This is already beginning to show evidence of some improvements in water quality at a number of locations. The strategy is underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which were made in July 1998. The regulations set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes within a ten year timeframe.</P>
      <P>The strategy is being supported by my own Department's major £1.5 billion programme of investment in sewage infrastructure facilities throughout the country in the ten year period to 2005. This programme lays particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where a need is indicated. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has substantial initiatives under way to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the new control of farm pollution scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department wishes to promote and support the making of bye-laws by local authorities under section 21 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1990 to control and/or prohibit certain agricultural activities in the interests of avoiding water pollution. The powers of local authorities to make such bye-laws were extended and strengthened by the Local Government Act, 1994 (Bye-Laws) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 78 of 1999). While it is open to Galway and Mayo County Councils to act under these regulations, I will keep the need for further legislative initiatives under continuing review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>Environment in Focus was published by the Environmental Protection Agency as a discussion document in the context of the agency's work on the development of key national environmental indicators. It does not constitute the annual report of the agency, which I am awaiting in respect of 1998.</P>
      <P>Environment in Focus is a welcome contribution to public understanding of the relationship between economic activity and environmental quality. Indicators like those included in this publication play an important part in informing the review of public policies and in the modification of behaviour in society so that the growth we need to maintain is not at the expense of our environmental and natural resource base.</P>
      <P>I have developed and will continue to put in place a wide range of policy, legislative and other measures to address environmental pressures and ensure that development is sustainable. These include strengthened protection of water and air quality, a new waste management policy framework and substantially increased investment in environmental infrastructure. A comprehensive new Planning and Development Bill has been published, a climate change abatement strategy is now in preparation and we are embarking on a new national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>I expect that the measurement of appropriate indicators by the EPA will enable us to assess the relevance and success of our policies and continue to target our responses to environmental problems as effectively as possible. However, sustainable development cannot be achieved without the active support and participation of the public. In this regard, I will shortly be initiating a major campaign to promote greater awareness on critical aspects of behaviour including waste prevention, personal transport choices, water conservation and litter control.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>On 8 April 1999 all housing authorities were requested to assess the extent to which the new affordable housing scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which should be brought to construction at the earliest possible date. Responsibility for inviting, processing and approving applications under the scheme rests with individual housing authorities and, accordingly, I have no function in this regard.</P>
      <P>The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land and the planning and construction of houses does, of necessity, require some time to arrange. Nevertheless the new scheme is progressing satisfactorily and the first houses under the scheme will be completed by the end of this year. There are projects under the scheme at planning stage throughout the country and construction of a substantial number of dwellings will be under way by early 2000. I envisage that some 1400 houses will be provided under the scheme by the end of 2000.</P>

In addition, as the scheme is not included in the 1999 water services investment programme it comes within the terms of my Department's circular L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority list will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The report of the 1999 assessment of homelessness in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, was prepared for the homeless initiative by the Economic and Social Research Institute and has been recently published. The report indicates that there was a total of 3,890 homeless people consisting of 2,900 adults and 990 dependent children in the area during the week of the survey. This survey differed from previous surveys in that it was carried out over a seven day period and is therefore more comprehensive. The survey formed part of the national assessment of homelessness carried out by local authorities on 31 March 1999 and the results of this assessment are being released today. This will indicate that there was a total of 5,234 homeless people in the country as a whole, of whom 3,992 were adults and 1,242 dependent children.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned in co-operation with the other statutory and voluntary agencies to formulate responses to meet the accommodation and welfare needs of homeless people in their areas. For my part, my Department will continue to afford priority to measures to meet the accommodation needs of homeless persons. In particular, the cross-departmental team on homelessness which was established under the aegis of my Department will have regard to the extent of homelessness recently assessed by both the ESRI report and by local authorities in preparing an integrated response to homelessness across a range of issues facing homeless persons. The issues to be addressed include matters relating to emergency and permanent accommodation as well as health, education and welfare matters. I expect that the cross-departmental team will finalise its report in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Greater Dublin Water Supply Strategic Study published in 1996 shows that there is only 332 metres of lead mains in the greater Dublin area out of a total mains length of over 5.8 million metres. The study estimates that about 92,000 properties or 26 per cent of the total properties in the greater Dublin area have lead service pipes, which are normally the responsibility of the property owner, connecting the property to the public water mains. In the case of Cork city, an estimated 20,000 properties or 44 per cent of properties in the city have lead service pipes. No breakdown is available for either location as between domestic and non-domestic properties. Information in relation to lead piping in other parts of the country will be supplemented by information gathered under the national water study which is due to be completed early in 2000.</P>
      <P>The new drinking water directive has tightened the parametric value for lead from 50 micrograms per litre to 10 micrograms per litre. A 15 year timeframe to the end of 2015 is specified for achieving compliance with the new standard with an interim value of 25 micrograms per litre to be achieved by the end of 2005. Compliance with the interim standard will generally be achieved through the provision of appropriate treatment at water treatment plants while compliance with the 10 micrograms per litre standard could involve replacement of lead services as appropriate. Full assessment of the cost implications of meeting the new lead standard must await determination of a recommended sampling method for lead. Proposals in this regard are expected from the EU Commission before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Some 99,000 applicants are at present awaiting driving tests. Of these, approximately 33,000 have been given test appointments and a further 13,000 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. The average waiting time for a driving test is at present some 28 weeks; the average longest waiting period per test centre is some 34 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments: about 25 per cent of applicants are tested within 15 weeks. Average waiting times have not been compiled for each test centre due to limitations in the IT systems involved.</P>
      <P>Applications for driving tests are now running at more than a third above earlier levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. In 1998 an all time record of nearly 150,000 test applications were made to my Department. In 1999 test applications have so far increased by a further 2.5 per cent over 1998.</P>
      <P>Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to some 202,000 tests annually.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in replies to previous questions, I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvement to the quality of driving test service provided to the public and in particular to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times. On the basis of the measures now taken, a maximum waiting period of 10 weeks is being targeted by the end of next year.</P>

These included advance notice of the holding of the local elections in conjunction with the European elections; the establishment of a Referendum Commission and a publicity campaign on voter registration. There was also a vigorous campaign by political parties and candidates and a high level of informed media coverage.</P>
    <P>In response to some of the difficulties encountered at the June polls, the Government agreed to, and my Department is currently undertaking, a review of the provision of information at referenda.</P>
    <P>A review of the electoral system itself is currently being undertaken by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in the context of its examination of the institutions of the State and I would hope that their report, when it is available, will provide a basis for an informed public debate on our electoral system and the scope for reform.</P>

      <P>The information in my Department is not such as to enable me to give the detailed information in the form requested. However, at the end of 1998 my Department carried out an assessment of housing lands availability in the greater Dublin, Cork and Galway areas, the most critical areas in terms of housing supply. The results of this survey were published in The Housing Market: An Economic Review and Assessment by Peter Bacon and Associates in March 1999. A follow-up survey by my Department in July this year has shown substantial increases in the current levels of zoned and serviced land in the Dublin and Galway areas since then. I am circulating with the official report a table setting out these figures. The projected levels are set to increase further in the period to 2003. The 29 per cent overall increase between the 1998 and 1999 surveys is attributable to the effect of increasing house densities resulting from the draft housing density guidelines published by my Department in March, the rezoning of additional land and the serviced land initiative.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that around 500,000 additional houses will be required over the next ten years. The actual amount of land required to meet this housing need is a function of location, densities, house types and sizes, etc. and it is difficult to see that an estimate of the area of land required over the whole country would be very meaningful in practice. However, under the Planning and Development Bill, 1999 each local authority will be required to prepare and incorporate in its development plan a strategy to meet the housing needs of their current and future population. The strategy must be prepared within one year of the Act coming into force and should result in a better match between housing and residential zoning.</P>

      <P>The need to accelerate the improvement of urban roads and footpaths has been a particular emphasis of non-national road grant allocations in 1999. Urban road authorities will receive almost £22 million in non-national road grants in the current year, an increase of 33 per cent over the 1998 grant payment figure and an increase of 90 per cent over the 1997 figure of £11.5 million.</P>
      <P>The total allocation to urbans in 1999 includes £13.9 million by way of discretionary or block grants. These grants will be available to meet the cost of maintenance and improvement works on non-national roads and for a programme of footpath and carriageway repairs. A new feature of the 1999 programme is the assignment of £4.2 million of the block grant for urbans for use specifically on restoration works on carriageways and footpaths.</P>
      <P>I intend that urban road authorities will continue to receive a fair share of the funds available for non-national roads, so that urban road needs can be systematically addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum mortgage loan which it would be appropriate to advance in any instance can be determined only by reference to the particular borrower's circumstances including the level and nature of income, outgoings generally, and likely ability to meet repayments in the event of a change in circumstances. It is incumbent on lenders to carry out rigorous assessment of these, and any other relevant factors, in each case. Obviously, borrowers should also exercise great care in ensuring that they do not take on commitments that they might not be able to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Mortgage lending institutions in Ireland have traditionally applied a maximum loan to income ratio of two and a half times the principal income plus once the second income. I would be very concerned about any general relaxation in mortgage lending standards at this time. This would have adverse effects on house prices and set back the progress being made with the Government's measures to achieve balance in the housing market and house price stabilisation.</P>
    <P>Survey data in my Department indicate that, in the first eight months of 1999, around 15 per cent of new houses and 20 per cent of second-hand houses in Dublin were purchased for £95,000 or less. Typically, these would have been starter homes purchased by first-time buyers, and would be affordable by persons on the incomes quoted.</P>

It is the Government's intention that it be enacted by Easter of next year, although this is dependent on the co-operation of all parties in both Houses, so that the proposals in this radical and necessary legislation can be implemented as quickly as possible. I intend to make the necessary commencement orders immediately on enactment of the Bill and planning regulations will also be made promptly. Regulations under Part V of the Bill relating to the supply of housing are subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 has set out a range of policies and measures designed to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20 per cent by 2002 relative to 1997.</P>
      <P>The first progress report of the high level group on road safety was published in July 1999 and details progress with implementing the strategy. Copies of that report have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report notes good progress towards the primary strategy target in the first year: 3 per cent less people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997; 12 per cent less people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997: this represents the lowest number of serious injuries for this decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target of at least 20 per cent reduction.</P>
      <P>Progress towards the supporting targets of the strategy has also been made. Car and truck speeds were slightly down; there were less fatal accidents in the nighttime hours, commonly drink related; and engineering measures to reduce accidents have been implemented at 93 national road locations.</P>
      <P>The report also describes progress on key strategy actions scheduled for 1998 and 1999. The use of automatic speed detection systems has been extended and fixed speed cameras are about to be commissioned; evidential breath testing for drink driving will commence in October 1999; on-the-spot fines have been extended to non-wearing of seat belts and a range of other road safety related offences; and the heads of a Bill are currently in preparation in my Department to provide for a penalty points system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The DTI strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructure projects such as LUAS, the Dublin Port Tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-Ring; other improvements in public transport such as quality bus corridors; and traffic and parking management measures. Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructural projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the DART extensions and the Southern Cross motorway, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green links of the LUAS and to the south-eastern and northern motorways.</P>
      <P>The DTO Short-Term Action Plan, published in September 1998, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. Detailed objectives include completion of 12 QBCs and 180 kms of cycle tracks by end 2000, provision by end 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus at a cost of £26 million, additional rolling stock for DART, lengthening of outer suburban and key DART station platforms, and upgrading by end 2000 of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the short-term action plan. For example, the programme of platform lengthening has commenced; contracts have been entered into for the additional DART rolling stock; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the QBC network with three QBCs now in operation; and 105 of the new buses have already been delivered, 84 of which are in service. Moreover, the increased bus capacity now available is enabling the provision of significantly <Col N="934" /> enhanced bus services along the three QBC routes; this capacity will be further augmented as more buses become available in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the development of quality bus corridors is an important element within the framework of the DTI Strategy and the DTO Short-Term Action Plan. Three QBCs have already been completed and results from the Lucan and Malahide QBCs, which have been in operation for some time now indicate an overall increase in total person trips, a considerable reduction in bus journey times, and an increase in bus passengers of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent on the routes.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the short-term action plan, the Minister for Finance has also announced the removal of benefit in kind taxation from public transport passes provided by employers for their employees, tax incentives to promote park and ride facilities, and a review of the potential for benefit in kind taxation of workplace parking.</P>
    <P>I recently published guidelines on the development of park and ride facilities setting out criteria and requirements in order for developers to avail of the tax incentives provided in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>A Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 has recently been published by DTO to assist the preparation of the new National Development Plan: this proposes a range of investment in the Dublin area to a cost of more than £2 billion over the period 2000-2006. For the longer term, the DTO are currently updating the original DTI strategy; this will lead to the publication by end 1999 of an updated strategy for the period 2000-2016.</P>

      <P>An estimated 371,000 provisional licences were current as at 31 December, 1998.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to attain this longer term goal, the short-term priority must be to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. I <Col N="935" /> have already outlined, in the reply to Question No. 80 on today's Order Paper, the significant additional resources now being made available to support this process.</P>
    <P>Measures have been in place for some years, and will be maintained, to restrict the indefinite holding of provisional licences. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, is developing recommendations for improving access to motor insurance for young people. The possibility of affording greater credit for the holding of a full driver licence may arise in this context.</P>

      <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly, which is operated by health boards, administers an emergency aid programme to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. Typically, aid is available under the scheme for repairs which would make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant. Given the nature of the scheme and the purpose for which it is intended, the installation of central heating systems would not come within its scope.</P>
      <P>However, in cases where heating is deficient, some form of heating can be provided under the scheme. Certain works such as the installation of an additional radiator, upgrading a range, repairing a chimney or fire-place, provision of storage heaters or oil-filled radiators could be undertaken.</P>
      <P>In addition there are a number of options currently available to local authorities to assist older people in securing necessary improvement works to their housing including the provision of heating facilities. These include the disabled persons grant scheme, the scheme of improvement works in-lieu of local authority housing and local authority house improvement loans.</P>

      <P>The level of fixed interest rate charged on local authority tenant purchase schemes is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The present fixed rate is 6.75 per <Col N="937" /> cent and is currently being reviewed by the agency.</P>
      <P>Fixed interest rates on loans are related to the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans are advanced and are fixed for the life of the loan. The costs of reducing the fixed rates on existing tenant purchase loans would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>However, any person with a fixed rate local authority loan is free to redeem without penalty and refinance, if necessary, in the private sector at the lower rates currently available. This is a significant concession which would not be available in respect of fixed rate loans from commercial lending agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Rules of conduct for officers of local authorities were issued in 1960. These rules contain a provision that a local authority officer should not ask for or accept any gift or reward of any kind for any help or information given to the public on official matters. This applies to hospitality as well as to actual gifts.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are reminded regularly of the need to ensure that officers are aware of the requirement for integrity in the performance of their duties and of the prohibition on a local authority office holder from engaging in any other gainful occupation which might conflict with the interests of the local authority or be inconsistent with the discharge of the duties of their office.</P>
      <P>Particulars of office for local authority officers include a provision to the effect that holders of local authority offices shall pay to the local authority any fees or other moneys, other than inclusive salary, payable to or received by them by virtue of their office or in respect of services which they are required by or under any enactment to perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 32 and 33 of the 1976 Planning and Development Act require officials of planning authorities to make a declaration of all relevant interests which are then maintained in a register open to the public by the local authority. Officials must also, where they have a beneficial interest in a matter before the authority, declare that interest to the manager, or in the case of the man<Col N="938" /> ager to the authority. They are also prohibited from seeking to influence the decision of the authority. Failure to comply with these provisions is an offence under the Acts. These provisions are being re-enacted in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The 1999 Bill also contains an additional provision section 135 requiring planning authorities to draw up codes of conduct for members and staff dealing with conflicts of interest and promoting public confidence in the integrity of the conduct of the authority's business. Any recommendations made by the Flood Tribunal will also be considered in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>In addition, as part of the ongoing major programme of local government renewal, it is my intention to introduce a comprehensive code of ethics, applicable to all local authority employees in the forthcoming Local Government Bill.</P>

      <P>Article 19 of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, provides that each local authority is responsible for the enforcement of the regulations within its functional area, and requires local authorities to take such steps as are necessary for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is a matter for each local authority, using the extensive powers available under the Waste Management Act, 1996, and the 1997 regulations, to identify businesses which are &ldquo;major producers&rdquo; within the meaning of the regulations, and ensure that they comply with their legal obligations. I have no direct function in relation to the enforcement of the 1997 regulations.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am concerned that there should be effective implementation of the regulations so that responsibility for recycling packaging waste is borne equitably by packaging producers. Businesses which meet their producer responsibility obligations, either as members of Repak (which I understand now has 364 member companies) or on an individual basis, should not be placed at a commercial disadvantage by free riders who seek to evade these obligations. Accordingly, my Department has, where possible, endeavoured to facilitate the effective enforcement and implementation of the regulations by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that local authorities are generally now devoting more resources to the enforcement <Col N="939" /> of the 1997 regulations than was the case heretofore and, while further improvement is necessary in this regard, I am satisfied that progress is being achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered, under the Local Government Act, 1994, to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes. The criteria to be applied to the provision of public open space in housing schemes is a matter for each local authority in accordance with their development plan. When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities. My Department does not have any information avail<Col N="941" /> able to substantiate the claim that less land is now being made available for public open spaces than was the case a century ago.</P>
      <P>The recently published Planning Guidelines on Residential Density indicate that public open space is one of the key elements in defining the quality of the residential environment. The guidelines acknowledge that, in general, planning authorities set out detailed quantitative standards for public open space in their development plans, but less emphasis is placed on qualitative standards. This can give rise to residential estates having adequate amounts of open space but often poorly located or unsuitably shaped. This can result in under-used spaces and in some cases spaces which encourage anti-social activity. The guidelines indicate that the achievement of higher densities must be coupled with a higher standard of residential environment and thus the provision of higher quality communal and public open spaces is of paramount importance. The guidelines recommend that any acceptance of lower quantitative standards of open space must be accompanied by a parallel increase in qualitative standards of open space. The guidelines set out detailed qualitative and quantitative standards in relation to the provision of public open space in higher density residential developments.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, amenity areas, etc., specifically in local authority housing schemes, is also a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. Appropriate limited facilities of this kind are funded as part of the cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations where the work is undertaken in conjunction with the provision of new local authority housing or the refurbishment of existing housing under the remedial works scheme.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have recently been advised in new social housing design guidelines issued by the Department that appropriate provision should be made within schemes for play areas, including play spaces for small children, and soft and hard landscaping of all common open space areas. In relation to public open space, authorities were advised that in deciding on the extent and nature of open space within a scheme, regard should be had to the size of the scheme, the nature of accommodation being provided, existing open space provision in the area and the requirements of the development plan for the area. Open space generally should be laid out so that it is attractive and usable by the residents. Large undefined areas should be avoided as should pockets of badly shaped, fragmented or unusable land which is difficult to maintain.</P>

      <P>By virtue of the recent constitutional amendment the next local elections fall to be held in 2004. In the context of the forthcoming local government Bill the question of introducing directly elected cathaoirligh in the case of county and city local authorities is being considered along with a longer term of office for all cathaoirligh. Current local government law provides that the cathaoirleach of a local authority is elected annually by the members of that local authority. These arrangements will continue to operate until replaced by new statutory provisions. The local government Bill will set out the new framework and provide for when it will come into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, sets down that employment agencies along with other employers must provide their employees, who are normally expected to work for not less than eight hours per week and who have been in continuous service for at least one month, with a written statement setting out certain particulars of the employee's terms of employment (the Act provides that the party who <Col N="947" /> is liable to pay the wages of an individual, whether the employment agency or a client company, is deemed to be the employer for the purposes of the Act and is obliged to provide the written statement).</P>
      <P>The written statement must contain terms and conditions, as specified in the Act. These include the rate or method of calculation of the employee's remuneration, hours of work, including overtime, and paid leave entitlements. An employer is generally not required to provide payment for sick leave unless by agreement. The written statement must be provided by the employer within two months of the date of commencement of employment. I have no immediate plans to introduce legislation to alter this requirement.</P>
      <P>As regards enforcement, an employee may present a complaint to a rights commissioner if it appears that his-her employer has failed to provide a full and accurate written statement of the terms of employment. The rights commissioner will issue a written recommendation which may be appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Where the employer has neither appealed nor implemented the rights commissioner's recommendation, the employee may refer the complaint to the Employment Appeals Tribunal which will issue a determination without hearing the case and will confirm the recommendation in its determination. In situations where employers do not implement a determination of the tribunal favourable to the employee, there is provision for the employee to refer the matter to the employment rights section of my Department for enforcement through the District Court.</P>
      <P>In the year to date, 123 complaints in all have been referred to the rights commissioner's service, of which five recommendations have been appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal &ndash; these statistics do not specifically identify cases where the employer was an employment agency.</P>
      <P>In the above circumstances, employment agency workers have the same rights of complaint as other workers and as such are not particularly vulnerable in this respect. As regards low pay, the Government is committed to the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage from April 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 128, 130, 131 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, scheduled to be held in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999, will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations in the WTO in 2000. The European Union has been, and is, engaged in the detailed work, within the WTO, preparing for these negotiations. Ireland has participated fully in the preparation of EU positions.</P>
      <P>The EU is firmly convinced that a comprehensive trade round, involving a broad range of issues is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
      <P>Eight rounds of trade liberalisation and strengthening of multilateral trade rules have made a major contribution to global prosperity, development and rising living standards. Since 1951, global trade has grown 17 fold, world production has more than quadrupled, and world per capita income has doubled. The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to successfully integrate into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by almost 50 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, has brought about major improvements in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in particular smaller countries. Over the period <Col N="949" /> 1995-97, the volume of global trade increased by almost 8 per cent annually, far outpacing the growth in GNP WTO and OECD studies on the impact of the Uruguay Round have confirmed the positive impact on the world economy as its results are taking effect.</P>
    <P>In addition to a decision to launch a new round of trade negotiations, I would hope that the Seattle Ministerial will take decisions that will strengthen the WTO as an institution. These could include improvements to the dispute settlement understanding, the creation of an institutional basis to better address development concerns, the improvement of co-operation between the WTO and other major international institutions and improved procedures to create greater transparency and public awareness of the WTO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the introduction of national minimum hourly wage from April 2000. The legislation to give effect to this commitment is currently being drafted and I intend to introduce it shortly. It is being drafted following consideration of the report of the national minimum wage commission, inter-departmental examination of the costs and methodology and extensive consultations with the social partners.</P>
      <P>All employers, including employers in the hairdressing industry to whom the legislation will apply, will be obliged to pay not less than the national minimum hourly wage. As recommended in the final report of the inter-departmental group, I will be proposing that sub-minimum rates will apply in certain defined circumstances. I will be proposing a sub-minimum rate for employees under the age of 18, at 70 per cent of the full rate. In line with the recommendation of the national minimum wage commission I will also be proposing that a sub-minimum rate will apply to trainees undergoing a prescribed course of study or training. The applicable rates will be 75 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the full rate in the first, second and third year of study or training respectively, or where the study or training period is less than three years the different rates will apply to each one third of the duration of the study or training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated above the proposed legislation will provide for a national minimum hourly wage for employees. As legislation is currently in force concerning the maximum number of hours that an employee may work, which also applies to <Col N="950" /> employees in the hairdressing industry, I have no proposals to make on that issue.</P>

      <P>I refute the Deputy's allegation that no action has been taken regarding the complaint made in this case.</P>
      <P>A complaint concerning the activities of the insurance intermediary, referred to by the Deputy, was first made to our Department by another insurance intermediary in June of last year. The matter was examined at that time and it was determined that there was no basis for action on our part and the person who made the complaint was so informed.</P>
      <P>Further allegations have very recently been made by the same party against the same individual concerning the person's fitness to practice as an insurance intermediary. Our Department is currently examining these further allegations. We have also sought legal advice as to the action or actions, if any, which we should or can take in the matter having regard to the provisions of the Insurance Act 1989.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the existing regime for the regulation of insurance intermediaries, which was established by the Insurance Act 1989, is inadequate. Accordingly, I sought and received Government approval in February 1998 to introduce a more comprehensive regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries using the extensive powers available to the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. Legislation to give effect to this is at an advanced stage of drafting and I hope to be in a position to introduce a Bill on the subject during the months ahead.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>I met separately with both the INOU and ICTU on 25 September 1999 to provide clarification regarding the Government decision of 21 July to restructure the community employment programme.</P>
      <P>At these meetings I provided the following clarification of the Government decision. The average level of places on CE schemes for 1999 will be maintained at 37,500 as previously agreed. In this context and given that the participation level at the beginning of 1999 was some 40,000 the projected outturn participation at the end of the year will be in the order of 37,000. There will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of social economy jobs and any reductions of CE places. Social economy jobs will in general be full time jobs so there will not be a direct one for one ratio. There will be consultations with the social partners within the P2000 committee on labour market issues on how best to allocate any medium-term resources freed up by the restructuring of CE to fit the needs of long-term unemployed. There will be consultations with the social partners at a central level on the proper funding and provision of essential services currently delivered through CE. I indicated that the refocusing of resources towards alternative programmes already agreed with the social partners earlier this year is already operational.</P>
      <P>The Government decision to reduce the number of CE places by 4,500 over a five year period, and transfer the resources for 5000 places to a dedicated social economy programme, remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>I received the report of the Donegal task force on 1 July 1999 and arranged to have it presented to Government as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report presents a detailed analysis of the development challenge facing the county and recommends a seven year development strategy to implement the investment priorities identified. The timing of the report is particularly appropriate as it enables the investment programme <Col N="952" /> recommended to be considered in the context of preparing the National Development Plan 2000-06. Sustainable economic and employment growth and the promotion of balanced regional development will be among the key objectives of the national development plan. It will also include measures to tackle Ireland's infrastructural deficit as a potential major constraint on competitiveness, economic progress and social development. The report of the Donegal task force makes a wide range of recommendations which are consistent with these objectives. Accordingly, on my recommendation, the Government decided on 14 July that all relevant Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities it proposes in drafting the operational programmes of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to meet with the chairman and members of the task force on 8 October, to discuss follow-up action on the report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>Seals are a protected wildlife species under the terms of the Wildlife Acts which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. While I have, therefore, no direct function in relation to the funding of the Irish seal sanctuary I will bring the present funding needs of the sanctuary to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. As indicated in previous answers to questions on this matter I should add that the marine institute has ongoing contacts with the Irish seal sanctuary and facilitates access to its programmes where appropriate.</P>

There were a number of issues on which clarification was required and when these issues were addressed, the council was requested to activate the public consultation process. The council placed an advertisement in the <i>Dungarvan Leader </i>on 10 September to commence the public consultation process. Under regulations, this process must continue until 10 October 1999 at which stage I am required to give the council an opportunity to respond to any objections made before I can consider the application and make a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Donegal employment initiative task force was established late last year in response to the job losses announced at Fruit of the Loom. As the Deputy will know, as a direct result of these job losses I arranged for a participative conference on the investment and employment opportunities in the marine sector in the county.</P>
      <P>I set a target for the identification of 1,000 new jobs and I am pleased to say that on foot of the conference potential for the immediate creation of some 650 new jobs was identified, along with the creation of a further 1,000 jobs in the longer term.</P>
      <P>The summary and recommendations resulting from the conference were forwarded to the task force and I am pleased to say, formed the basis of the marine section of the task force's report.</P>
      <P>I have taken a number of steps to build on the potential of Donegal's marine sector including: investment of £4 million in harbour developments in 1999; approval and commencement of a new £20 million landing facility at Killybegs; provision of funding under the interreg programme for an extension of the national fisheries training centre at Greencastle; commencement of a cross-Border aquaculture development programme which will work with the sector to provide technical and managerial support; accelerated licensing procedures, an independent board for appeals; intensification of BIM's and the marine institutes programmes to develop new fisheries in deepwater species and inshore fisheries.</P>
      <P>A total investment of some £84 million requiring State aid of £42 million has been recommended by the task force. This is in accord with the findings of the conference that I convened. This is a very significant level of State investment. However, the largest element of investment relates to the provision of improved landing infrastructure and as I have already stated a £20 million development programme for Killybegs has already been announced along with development and improvement works at a number of other harbours throughout the county. The Killybegs development will not only impact on the fisheries sectors but will also have consequential benefits for the off-shore industries.</P>
      <P>Investment in fleet improvements, aquaculture and processing is ongoing, but I am conscious of the need for increased investment in these sectors. In the context of the national development plan and the next round of structural funds I am making every effort to maximise the funding for the marine sectors, not only in Donegal, but nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make reference to an exciting <Col N="958" /> and developing sector within the marine industries family &ndash; marine tourism. Tourism in the north-west is worth in excess of £200 million annually and represents an industry which can provide a significant economic and employment contribution to Donegal. As the county has a rich, diverse and unspoilt coastline along with many rivers and lakes, it is in a strong position to develop a vibrant marine tourism and leisure sector. In order to assist in developing the sector I have requested the Marine Institute to prepare an integrated water based tourism and leisure strategy for the county, including the off-shore islands. This strategy will help to enhance the tourism package offered in Donegal and lead to higher visitor numbers.</P>
    <P>As part of my strategy for the marine tourism sector I have requested my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, to develop a major marine leisure investment programme and to this end a marine safety and tourism unit, headed by a principal officer, is being set up in my Department.</P>
    <P>All in all, I think the marine section of the task force's report has accurately reflected the current situation and focused on what needs to be done to realise the potential of the marine sector in Donegal. As outlined, programmes and initiatives have already commenced to address the needs identified. This process will continue.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently developing policy for the issue of foreshore leases for the construction and operation of generating stations to be situated on the foreshore. While policy is being decided, applications are being considered from intending developers for foreshore licences to allow the suitability of sites to be examined.</P>
      <P>The application from the Kish consortium is for a foreshore licence to allow such exploration to take place and is currently being processed. Exploration of the suitability of a site would involve minor disturbance of the seabed at selected locations around the licence area to determine the type of sea bed and sea bottom conditions to be encountered, and also, <i>inter alia, </i>include measurement of wind and wave strengths within the area.</P>
      <P>In the event that the outcome of such investigations proves the suitability of the site and the licensee wishes to proceed, the next step would be an application for a foreshore lease to allow construction and operation of the generating station. The application would have to be accompanied by an environmental impact statement, authorisation to construct an electricity station and licences to generate and supply electricity.</P>
      <P>Public notice would, of course, have to be given of any such application and interested parties would be given a full opportunity to comment on the application. Planning permission would also be required for shore based works associated with the transmission of electricity generated to the national grid or directly to customers as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the question on this subject answered last week, the Government, along with most other donors, is committed to reaching the UN target for aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>Official development assistance since 1992 has increased from £40 million to an expected £178 million this year. As a percentage of GNP, Official Development Assistance has arisen in the same period from 0.16 per cent to 0.35 per cent.</P>
      <P>In its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government committed itself to move to an interim target of 0.45 per cent in its lifetime. Since taking office it has allocated significant cash increments to aid each year. As a result, the allocation in 1999 is expected to reach an all time high of £178 million.</P>
      <P>A complication in making equivalent progress in the ODA-to-GNP ratio has been the extraordinary growth in GNP in recent years. In this circumstance it is difficult to predict when the UN target will be reached. However, as a result of an agreement with the Minister for Finance, the aid administered by my Department will continue to increase in cash terms by appreciable amounts in 2000 and 2001. On the following table, figures are provided for ODA from 1992 to 1999. Figures in the detail sought by the Deputy are not easily available for the years before 1992. The figures for 1999 represent the best estimate available at the moment.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide reliable estimates of ODA composition for the next three years given the large number of variables involved, from the aid percentage of the EU budget to the demand under the European Development Fund, which is being negotiated. In addition, apart from the usual difficulties in predicting the level of GNP, I understand that a new method of calculating GNP is being introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Huntstown Airpark Limited proposed some years ago to build a private terminal at Dublin Airport. The then Minister, Deputy Dukes, decided against this proposal. Planning permission for this development was refused, on appeal, early this year. Last year Ryanair proposed, <i>inter alia,</i> to build a second terminal at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>As regards proposals for the future development of the military aerodrome at Baldonnel, this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in the first instance. Both the Minister for Defence and I have received several proposals in relation to limited development of civil aviation at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airports policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to both issues, advisers have been appointed jointly by the Minister for Finance and me to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report on its future strategic direction. Its report will assist me to assess the position of Baldonnel <Col N="962" /> and of a second terminal against that wider policy backdrop. It is expected that the advisers will complete their work in the near future.</P>
    <P>Following the receipt of their report and consideration of their recommendations, I intend to report to Government with my recommendations in respect of both issues. It would not be appropriate for me at this point to speculate on what those recommendations will be.</P>

      <Quest>her response to the Donegal task force report which was presented in June 1999; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18913/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I studied with interest this very comprehensive report. Many of the recommendations put forward by the Donegal employment initiative task force are already receiving active support by my Department or by the State bodies under my aegis.</P>
      <P>The report recognises the support which is being given by my Department to improve air access to the region. Donegal Airport is currently receiving assistance under three separate headings. The daily air service to Dublin is supported under the essential air services programme and Exchequer grants are provided for capital developments and marketing services. In relation to the city of Derry Airport, I have provided a £1.5 million capital grant for runway improvement work. This is being matched by a similar grant from the Office of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I have a particular interest in a Derry to Dublin air service, as discussed in the report, and the possibilities for encouraging such a service are under active review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report calls for the upgrading of the Sligo-Dublin rail link and I can confirm that upgrading of this route to continuous welded rail forms part of the Iarnród Eireann £430 million railway safety programme 1999-2003. In addition, the company plans to carry out renewal works on a number of <Col N="963" /> bridges and level crossings as well as improving the fencing on the line. In relation to the provision of shuttle-feeder links into Donegal, I understand that Bus Éireann already runs bus services from Sligo railway station which serve the south Donegal and Derry areas and that consideration is being given to increasing these services.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required telecommunications infrastructural investment. Given the importance of such investment as a basis for employment generation, I awarded, on 5 July 1999, co-funding under the EU INTERREG and economic infrastructure operational programmes to two projects which will support the development of advanced communications networks and services in Donegal. Esat Telecom will roll out fibre optic cable in ten urban areas in the State, including Letterkenny and Eircom will install a 95 km. high capacity fibre optic cable along the west coast of Donegal, from Bunbeg to Donegal town and from Dunfanaghy to Falcarragh serving all communities &ndash; up to 71,000 people &ndash; along the route. Contracts for these two projects have been signed and works must be completed by 31 December 2000. In addition, Eircom will provide 0.3 million euros from its own resources to help establish two technology information communication centres in Donegal which will provide IT and telecommunications services to local communities and businesses.</P>
    <P>Following on these initiatives, my Department in association with Forfás, is currently preparing telecommunications investment proposals for the next national development plan. In targeting this investment, I have asked my officials to take full account of the recommendations contained in the Donegal employment initiative task force report. The report calls for the building of a 110 kv electricity loop in west Donegal.</P>
    <P>ESB have successfully applied, with the assistance of my Department, for TENS funding to study reinforcement and the long-term supply options in the north west. This study is still ongoing. The second interim progress report has recently been forwarded by ESB to the European Commission. The results of the study will set out the best option for strengthening the networks, obtaining planning permission and bringing the project to the investment stage.</P>
    <P>The task force has called for the commissioning of a report to examine the serving of the north and west of Ireland with natural gas.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of bringing gas to Derry is under consideration by the Northern Ireland authorities. The Deputy will be aware of the recent announcement of a gas find in the Corrib field and of the possibilities this may offer for the supply of gas to the north west. Both of these possibilities have some potential to improve the prospects extending the supply of natural gas to Donegal. Until more is known about these <Col N="964" /> events, it would be somewhat premature to commission the report recommended by the task force.</P>

They were also informed that as a consequence they were overpaid under the 1997 special beef premium scheme and the money would have to be refunded. This decision was appealed but the appeal was rejected by letter dated 19 July 1999. The special beef premium <Col N="966" /> unit wrote to the person named seeking recovery of £6,738.19 on the 20 August 1999.</P>
      <P>As a reply has not been received to date the outstanding amount has been written to the overpayment file.

Therefore this transaction will leave an outstanding over payment balance of £1,433.44.</P>
      <P>A further letter giving details of entitlements under the 1997 and 1998 schemes, recoveries made in respect of outstanding overpayments and the existing overpayment balance will issue to the person named in the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>The visit by Department representatives to this and other farms in the Askeaton area in early 1996 was a preliminary part of the Askeaton animal health investigation and was aimed at gathering outline information on the animal health status of a number of farms in the area.

    <P>Numerous efforts were subsequently made by my Department to revisit the farm in question for the purpose of conducting a detailed assessment of animal health on the farm.

      <P>In so far as the recommendations in the report relate to my area of responsibility, the strategy proposed to be followed in the new <Col N="969" /> round of Structural Funds will include the development of services and alternative income generating enterprises both on- and off-farm for farmers and rural dwellers, including the further development of rural tourism. The previous prohibition on grant aid to part-time farmers has been removed from the various EU agricultural structures regulations and consequently they will be eligible for support in future. In addition, poverty proofing will ensure that measures are targeted in favour of low-income farmers.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report relating to the location of industry for providing employment and facilitating part-time farming reflect the strategy set out in the recent White Paper on Rural Development Ensuring the Future.</P>
      <P>The co-ordination of Leader with measures such as the operational programme for local urban and rural development will take place under the county development boards to be established from January next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 to 174, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The standards relating to the registration of holdings under Regulation 7 of the European Communities (Hygienic Production and Placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products) Regulation, 1996 are set out in Annex A, Chapters II and III of those regulations.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for the registration of milk production holdings were drawn up by my Department in advance of the introduction of the National Regulations (S.I. No. 9 of 1996) in January, 1996. Those guidelines in booklet form were made available to all interested parties. A copy can be made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Department's dairy produce inspectorate which is responsible for carrying out inspections under Regulation 7 has drawn up a detailed list of requirements which must be complied with to meet the standards set out in annex A. The Inspectorate has also issued a list of procedures to be followed by staff carrying out inspections. Those procedures were first issued in October 1993 and have been revised and reissued a number of times, most recently on 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of Regulation 7, when an authorised officer following an inspection of a holding forms the view that the holding does not comply with the standards set down in Annex A, a notice is given to the person in charge of the holding detailing the shortcomings. Depending on the extent and nature of those shortcomings a specified period of time is allowed to the person in charge to rectify the situation. After the end of that period the authorised officer will again visit the holding to check that the necessary improvements have been carried out.</P>
      <P>In relation to the revocation of registration the position is that this has been found necessary only in five cases.</P>

    <P>The Council of Ministers have agreed that compensation will be paid over the next three years to participants in the schemes affected by reductions arising from the introduction of the euro.</P>
    <P>Full compensation, with 100 per cent funding by the EU, will be payable for the reduction in 1999 pensions to participants who joined the scheme prior to 1998. Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid. It is hoped that the Commission will give the necessary approval by the end of November, and once such a decision is received payment will issue as soon as possible. Two further tranches of compensation at reduced levels will be paid</P>
    <P>Proposals for a revised scheme of early retirement from farming are currently being prepared in my Department in the context of the Agenda 2000 regulations. These regulations include a provision whereby the duration of early retirement support can be extended to the 75th birthday of the transferor.</P>

      <P>The Revenue job assist scheme was introduced in April 1998 to complement the wide range of schemes already available to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The basic requirement that must be met by an individual wishing to avail of the scheme is that he or she must have been continuously unemployed for the immediate 52 weeks prior to taking up a qualifying employment, and have been in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, or one parent family payment. The scheme has been extended, since 1 January 1999, to cater for an individual who has been in receipt of disability allowance or blind persons allowance.</P>
      <P>The tax allowance available under the scheme is due for three tax years and is tapered over that period. An individual may only claim the allowance for one three year period.</P>
      <P>The question proposes that applicants be allowed to change employment during the term of the scheme. In this regard I am glad to be able to clarify that it is already the case under the legislation governing the scheme, (Section 472A(4) Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997), that a qualifying individual may change employment once during the three year period, and still retain the tax allowance, provided the second employment is a qualifying employment. The allowance due in the second employment will be the allowance appropriate to the relevant tax year in the 3 year period. I trust this has clarified the position to the Deputy's satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>In my speech to the Joint Annual Discussion at the IMF and World Bank annual meeting, last week, I stressed that debt relief is a vital element in a more broadly based development strategy aimed at growth and poverty alleviation. Following is an extract of my contribution to the meeting on this subject. The full text of my statement is available under the annual meetings section of the IMF website (www.imf.org)</P>
      <P>The HIPC initiative, driven by the World Bank and the IMF, is the official response to the need for debt relief, particularly at the multilateral level, but also involving substantial, if not complete relief, in respect of official bilateral debt. The initiative is clearly at a crucial stage in its development both in relation to its general implementation and its financing.</P>
      <P>As originally conceived, the initiative aimed at both (i) freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt, and (ii) offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
      <P>Following the recent review of the initiative, it has been substantially enhanced &ndash; the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled, a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief &ndash; and my concern now is that these improvements are fully financed.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that Ireland was to the fore in calling for such improvements, in particular <i>via</i> the submissions made by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Review of HIPC, which preceded them.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the wide public concern for a serious attack on the problem of unbearable debt which is reflected in the extent of popular support for Jubilee 2000. This must be addressed and the HIPC initiative must be implemented in a way that achieves its basic aims, as set out above.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the World Bank, the IMF, and individual members and creditors, must remain open to any further enhancements required for effective debt alleviation, in particular taking greater account of human needs in determining eligibility and the extent of the relief required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries <Col N="976" /> even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>In my speech to the IMF annual meeting, therefore, I called on governors to resolve any outstanding difficulties in implementing the enhanced MPC initiative, particularly in regard to its financing. I am glad to say that there appears to have been substantial progress in financing the initiative in the course of the annual meetings. This is an aspect which we will need to keep under close review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the central point of the Deputy's question, I am not convinced that a blanket call for debt cancellation is attainable. Nether is debt cancellation on its own likely to provide a panacea for the economic and development need of HIPCs countries. Debt cancellation could send negative as well as positive signals. It does not in itself offer a long-term sustainable solution, in that it could well deny the countries affected access to sources of private capital, which are essential to their economic development. It might also lead to a drying up or reduction of some current bilateral aid which is intended to assist countries in their debt financing. Full cancellation of multilateral debt is not likely to be politically acceptable to the membership of the institutions concerned, who would be required to finance it.</P>
    <P>I fully support the bilateral initiatives by individual countries to relieve bilateral debt in line with the call of the G8 at their Birmingham summit. I would remind the Deputy that, such bilateral relief is also part of the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>I see the HIPCs initiative as a suitable framework through which viable economic and social reform programmes including debt relief measures can best be achieved. In this regard the Deputy should be aware that Ireland is also pressing the multilateral institutions to ensure that programmes drawn up by HIPC countries take adequate account of the social needs of these countries. We are also supporting increased co-ordination between the various institutions involved and with a wider spectrum of society in the countries concerned to ensure that aid, including debt relief, is used in the most efficient way to promote development and protect the social sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Extract:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>HIPC Initiative</i>Debt relief is a vital element in a more broadly based development strategy aimed at growth and poverty alleviation. The HIPC initiative, driven by the Bank and the Fund, is clearly at a crucial stage in its development. Although its beginnings were relatively modest, its ideals, or declared aims, were ambitious.</P>
    <P>It aims at both freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt, and offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the wide public concern <Col N="977" /> for a serious attack on the problem of unbearable debt which is reflected in the extent of popular support for Jubilee 2000. This must be addressed and the HIPC initiative must be implemented in a way that achieves its basic aims. We must remain open to any further enhancements required for this to be achieved, in particular, taking greater account of human needs in determining eligibility and the extent of the relief required.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, call on Governors to resolve any outstanding difficulties in implementing the enhanced HIPC initiative at this stage, particularly in regard to its financing.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, Ireland has adopted legislation enabling it to participate in funding the enhanced initiative to a degree commensurate with its relative standing in the donor community.</P>

      <P>Under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No 15) Order 1981 it is possible for individuals of all ages to obtain refunds in respect of certain aids and appliances, which assist persons with a disability overcome that disability. Before any purchase is made the individual should contact the VAT refunds section, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Government Buildings, Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare (tel: 065 684 1200) to ensure that the VAT can be refunded.</P>
      <P>In addition, taxpayers can claim income tax relief in respect of certain medical expenses on their own behalf or in respect of a spouse, dependent children or a qualifying dependent relative. For example, it is possible to obtain tax relief in respect of an orthopaedic bed or chair or a wheelchair or wheelchair lift where prescribed by a doctor. Form IT 6 which is available from the Revenue Commissioners gives further information.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question relates to a claim within RTE for a bicycle mileage allowance for employees using bicycles in the course of their work. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that where an employee uses a private bicycle for business purposes in the course of his-her duties a flat-rate mileage allowance can be paid without deduction of tax. Such payment by an employer is regarded as being no more than a reimbursement of allowable expenses. The law provides that employees' expenses qualify for deduction only where they are incurred &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; in performing the duties of the employment. Expenses which are incurred by employees travelling to and from the place of employment are not allowable for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any proposal for new or enhanced tax measures can only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty rates for all residential property were <Col N="981" /> reduced significantly by the Government as part of the package of taxation measures in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, arising out of the first Bacon report on house prices. This reduction in stamp duty rates has been of benefit to all residential property purchasers.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is no stamp duty on the sale of most new residential property where the purchaser is an owner occupier. Thus if the purchaser, in the case referred to, were to buy a larger new house, he would either pay no stamp duty at all where the house is not greater than 125 square metres, or if this new house is more than 125 square metres, he would pay stamp duty only on the site cost or a quarter of the value of the house, whichever is the greater.</P>
      <P>Given that I recently halved the rate of stamp duty at the lower end of the residential property market, making a further change to the code in the manner suggested may be absorbed by the sellers thus being of no benefit in practice to purchasers. Consequently, I have no plans to make any further changes to the stamp duty code in this regard.</P>

    <P> From 1 January 1999 to 31 May 1999, 76 new cases of HIV have been reported.</P>
    <P>Irish figures on HIV-AIDS reflect those in the developed world, with a lowering of cases and deaths from AIDS in recent years but a rise in the number of cases of HIV. The rate of increase has, however, stabilised. However, we must not become complacent about this condition and my Department will continue to give priority to HIV and AIDS. For this reason the National AIDS Strategy Committee is undertaking a review of all aspects of HIV-AIDS, with the aim of publishing an updated strategy in December 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department also continues to make available a range of materials and literature to educate the public, especially young people about the dangers of HIV-AIDS. The health promotion unit has run a media campaign to coincide with National and World AIDS Days. Specific messages have been placed in the washroom areas of third level colleges and some night clubs and pool halls. Most recently the decision by the Department of Education and Science to introduce relationship and sexuality education into schools will also contribute to creating a greater awareness of the issues among young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation to set up a health insurance authority is contained in Part IV of the Health Insurance Act, 1994. The recently published White Paper on Private Health Insurance stated that the Government has given approval, in principle, to the establishment of the authority and described the functions it would perform. It is my intention that the authority will be established at an early date and my Department will shortly be initiating the necessary arrangements in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> The functions of the authority do not include responsibilities in relation to the licensing of new facilities and equipment. It was considered that it would not be appropriate to attempt to limit the utilisation of new technology through a licensing procedure in circumstances where insurers have the capacity under existing health insurance regulations to engage in preferred provider arrangements as regards the facilities they cover on behalf of their customers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred, in particular, to the licensing of MRI scanners at public and private hospitals. The position in relation to private hospitals is that it is entirely a matter for the hospital authorities concerned to determine their position regarding the availability of such technology. In relation to public hospitals, an expert study was commissioned in regard to existing arrangements nationwide. This study was conducted by Professor David Banta, who is an international expert in health technology assessment. Professor Banta's findings, announced in 1997, identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital. My Department is currently in discussion with the management of the three hospitals concerning the installation and operational requirements for their facilities.</P>
    <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that a working group has been established within my Department to determine the best approach to the broader issue of health technology assessment. This work will be informed by initiatives in the area at EU level, and information and developments arising in that respect will be disseminated by my Department to public and private hospital interests and to insurers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I established the Medical Manpower Forum for the benefit of patients and doctors. The forum has recently produced a draft interim report which outlines the following extensive aims; to ensure that high quality and safe hospital services are available to patients at all times; to ensure that a fully trained doctor is available to all hospital patients as necessary at all times; to ensure that there are sufficient doctors with appropriate training and expertise employed in relevant specialties and disciplines to meet the needs of the patients in the public hospital medi<Col N="985" /> cal system at any given time; to provide for comprehensive teaching, training and research opportunities for public hospital doctors to continue to reach and maintain appropriate standards of professional competence; to recognise the important role played by hospitals in the provision of training for primary care and the need to continue and accommodate such training; to ensure a professionally satisfying career structure which is capable of attracting and retaining sufficient doctors to meet the ongoing needs of the hospital medical system; to develop flexible training, career and employment structures which meet the needs of both male and female doctors; to facilitate and support continuing medical education so as to keep abreast of developments and maintain competence; and to develop an appropriate employment and superannuation structure designed to support change and flexibility.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations is the creation of a new consultant grade to meet the serious gap in hospital medical staffing. The new consultant will be a fully qualified, fully trained and experienced doctor, with full clinical autonomy. While the main purpose of the Medical Manpower Forum is to improve hospital services for patients, major benefits will accrue to hospital doctors including changed work practices, greater career opportunities and improved teaching and training.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a reduction in surplus of income over expenditure for the Irish Medicines Board in 1998. According to the board, the drop in income was due mainly to the fact that the 1997 income had been boosted by companies submitting national applications in advance of the deadline that required applicants to follow the European route, and a corresponding fall-off in applications was noted in 1998.</P>
      <P>With the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in place, the Irish Medicines Board has experienced reduced numbers of national applications and an increase in the number of incoming mutual recognition applications, which carry a lower fee.</P>
      <P>However, I am satisfied that the board is succeeding in maintaining its statutory obligation to be self-funding as required under the Irish Medicines Board Act of 1995. Obviously the matter will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <P>In 1999, I provided a total of £1.145 million to the hospitals in the Southern Health Board area under the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that nationally the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent, since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996. The results are the first time in which waiting lists have fallen in two successive quarters.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies which achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
    <P>I also allocated £9 million to services for older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services, with the aim of freeing acute hospitals beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represent the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, its guidelines on the interpretation of the definition of a medicinal product as set out in the Council directive, has revised and updated similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. They do not include any new policies in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products, including natural medicinal products. If products presented on the market include a medicinal claim, the product concerned is a medicinal product, and must be the subject of authorisations under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which gives effect to Council Directive 65/65/EEC of 1965. In the light of such a consistent approach, the need has not arisen to consult with user groups of natural medicines up to the present time.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed recently by consumers and representative organisations regarding the possible application of the guidelines. It is neither mine nor the board's intention or desire to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of those medicines which they may wish to use. At the same time, it is generally accepted that, in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of alternative medicines is desirable and, this is supported in principle by the health food and alternative medicines industry. In this respect, the European Commission is considering what controls, if any, should be applied to health food products and natural medicines, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of alternative or traditional medicines, but has yet to bring forward any definitive proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, on foot of an initiative from my Department, representatives from the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf, and officials from the Eastern Health Board met to discuss the hospital's role within the health board area as a whole. Arising from these discussions proposals were drawn up by the hospital which matched the needs of the Eastern Health Board for the provision of step-down facilities. The provision of these facilities will go a long way to alleviate some of the current difficulties experienced in relation to pressures on beds and will free up beds for emergency admissions. This second phase of the development is under consideration within the national development plan, and I will revert to the hospital and Eastern Health Board as soon as possible. In the interim, conscious of the important role played by the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital in north Dublin, my Department was in a position recently to provide a further sum of £55,000 for minor capital and revenue works.</P>

New regional specialties of dermatology, nephrology, rheumatology, vascular surgery and oncology have been established and a trauma orthopaedic service has also been developed on site. These developments have been made possible by an increase of over £11 million in revenue funding for the hospital in the last three years and by the completion of major phased capital works on the site at a total cost of some £65 million. My Department is continuing to work with the South Eastern Health Board management in identifying and addressing priorities for the ongoing development of services at the hospital in the context of available funding.</P>

      <P>The national cancer strategy was published in 1996 and was followed in March 1997 by a three year action plan outlining details of how the strategy would be implemented. Since then, some £26 million has been allocated to a range of services to meet the commitments of the action plan and to advance the objectives of the strategy.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in implementing the three year action plan. The regional directors have worked in conjunction with the health boards and other service providers and have undoubtedly brought about substantial improvements in cancer treatment and care services. However, it is recognised that these developments will give rise to significant additional costs in coming years, the cost of oncology and haematology drugs being a major part of this additional cost. The main reasons for the substantial increases are the growing availability of newly developed drugs for the treatment of cancer and the growth in the volume of cancer drugs prescribed generally.</P>
      <P>The approximate total cost of new consultant medical oncology posts are between £800,000 and £1 million per annum in regional centres and up to £2 million per annum in the more complex supra-regional centres. Up to two thirds of these costs are related to cancer drugs.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the revenue implications of these important services for hospitals and I am working to ensure all cancer units are adequately supported to meet the needs placed upon them.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Contacts regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are ongoing with all interested parties involved with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulance in the overall context of pre-hospital care. I am continuing to provide additional funding for pre-hospital care with funding of over £7 million in 1999. This represents an increase of £2.7 million from 1998, the largest annual amount ever provided for the development of the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service approximately £23 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations. This has resulted in major improvements in the service, including the training of ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service falls to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally and any initiative in this area will complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder programme and other emergency response resources.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notification and inspection process is kept under review by the health boards. The main deficiencies identified by the inspection process relate to having a second adult on the premises <Col N="997" /> to ensure adequate supervision of pre-school children at all times and the availability of adequate space per child in the premises.</P>
    <P>Where deficiencies are identified, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction, that is, not replacing children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The timescale for making improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure, including the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. Following publication of this report the Government established an interdepartmental committee on child care chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. The report of the committee has been noted by Government which has referred the report for consideration to a ministerial group.</P>
    <P>It is intended to review the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, and this review will take place in the context of the other developments which have occurred since the regulations were introduced.</P>

This has led to a steady decline in the number of in-patients in St. Finan's Hospital and the sale of goods in the shop and the canteen has dropped accordingly. In view of this and of the fact that existing patients prefer to purchase some of their requirements outside the hospital and avail of the facilities in Killarney, the Southern Health Board, in consultation with staff and patients, reduced the opening hours of the facility to 15 hours per week. This mirrors operational hours of shops in other psychiatric facilities within the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related support services for children with autism, including Asperger's syndrome, is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards. I am very aware of the need to further develop the support services which are available to parents of children with autism. I was therefore pleased to be in a position this year to allocate additional funding of £1.5 million, with a full year cost of £2.5 million in 2000, for the further development of these services. This funding has been used to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and outreach services for children of school-going age. This multidisciplinary support includes speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, psychological and social work support.</P>
      <P>Planning for the development of further specialist services for children and adults with autism is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs in their regions.</P>
      <P>The provision of educational services for children with special needs, including those with autism, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who has expanded the range of services and support provided by his Department for this group. My Department, in conjunction with the health boards, will continue to liaise with the Department of Education and Science to provide health-related support services for school children with autism.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, prior to the establishment of specific educational services for children with autism by the Department of Education and Science, and because of the exceptional circumstances pertaining in these cases, a number of health boards made once off <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to assist a small number of families who had placed their children in services abroad. I understand those payments amount to approximately £75,000. I am also aware that <i>ex-gratia</i> payments were made in a number of cases where court proceedings were taken by parents of children with autism. These payments were made in recognition of expenses incurred by the parents. All such payments were made on a confidential basis and I am not therefore in a position to divulge any details relating to them.</P>
      <P>The question of the possible placement of children in educational services abroad would be a matter for the Department of Education and Science. I understand this would only arise in exceptional circumstances and that the priority for the Department of Education and Science is the development of services within the State.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries concerning the matter referred to in the Deputy's letter with Beaumont Hospital. The hospital has informed me that it was the practice in St. Laurence's Hospital to pay expenses to board members who attended meetings on a monthly basis. However, the hospital has also informed me that all records relating to such payments have since been destroyed so it is not possible to verify what payments may or may not have been made to the person named during the period in question.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment for eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area and the recruitment of orthodontists is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board. I understand that as a result of two full time dentists in the regional orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital commencing job-sharing, a vacancy for a dental surgeon has arisen in the unit. The board will endeavour to advertise and fill this position as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The provision of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the type of arrangement referred to in the Deputy's question is a matter for the relevant health board. I understand that the South-Eastern Health Board is making arrangements to have services provided <Col N="1002" /> at local level for the individual concerned and that the service input will be the same as that being provided in Bristol. In addition, as part of its service provision, the board will be seeking expert advice from the National Rehabilitation Hospital in relation to the treatment provided for the person concerned. I understand the board expects to have these services in place shortly and, in the circumstances, does not intend to continue supporting the person's stay at the centre in Bristol beyond that time.</P>

I seek to work with IBAL and other interested organisations in a positive and constructive manner. In this context IBAL were invited to participate in the recently formed national anti-litter forum which has been asked to report within six months with recommendations on bringing added value to the range of measures which I have already <Col N="1028" /> initiated. These include the establishment of an independent monitoring mechanism to report on local authority performance in controlling litter; support for the An Taisce led national spring clean and a new emphasis on enforcement which is demonstrated in the significant improvement in enforcement activity by local authorities reflected in the statistical returns available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of emissions trading is addressed in Ireland's CO2 abatement strategy produced in 1993. However, the Kyoto Protocol provides that flexible mechanisms &ndash; emissions trading, joint implementation and the clean development mechanism &ndash; may be used towards meeting greenhouse gas emissions commitments in the protocol. International negotiations on the rules, modalities and guidelines for the operation of these mechanisms are ongoing, with an expectation that agreement will be reached at the sixth conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change in late 2000-early 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position, as part of the overall EU negotiating position, is that provisions of the protocol in relation to the flexible mechanisms require that domestic action should provide the main means of meeting emissions commitments <Col N="1033" /> and that a concrete ceiling on the use of the mechanisms should be defined in quantitative and qualitative terms based on equitable criteria. The adopted EU position seeks to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the effort required to meet each party's target is achieved domestically.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate at this stage the extent that Ireland will utilise the flexible mechanisms, or to calculate at what price emissions might be traded.</P>
    <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 64 on today's Order Paper as regards the consultation group on greenhouse gas emissions trading.</P>

The first subsidiary directive to framework directive 96/62/EEC is directive 1999/30/EC relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air, was adopted on 22 April 1999. Member states are required to transpose the directive into national law by 19 July 2001. Depending on the pollutant, the directive prescribes hourly and-or daily and-or annual limit values. Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999 (SI no. 33 of 1999), the agency is the competent authority and body responsible for, <i>inter alia</i>, approval of such ambient air quality measuring devices as it considers necessary for the implementation of the directive and for the analysis of assessment methods. The agency has responsibility for the development of a nationwide air quality monitoring network which may build on such existing local authority arrangements as the agency considers appropriate to ensure the implementation of the directive. I understand that the agency is currently drafting a national air quality monitoring programme in this regard.</P>
      <P>The directive requires member states to ensure that up to date information on ambient concentrations of these pollutants is routinely made available to the public. I will be consulting with the agency in due course on the most appropriate mechanisms for this, including consideration of all modern communications systems and networks.</P>

      <P>The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and amendments, provide for the phased withdrawal of ozone depleting substances &ndash; ODS &ndash; and places controls on the production, consumption, import and export of ODS. Most ODS have now either been banned, for example, CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, or are being progressively phased out, for example, HCFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, methyl bromide. Some limited use of banned substances is allowed on a transitional basis for essential purposes, for example, CFCs for metered dose inhalers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland does not manufacture ODS; however, approximately 700 tonnes of CFCs are being imported this year for the manufacture of inhalers under essential uses provisions. Importation of CFCs under the essential uses provision is being phased out as non-CFC inhalers become approved. On provision of relevant product details, figures for trade in ODS that are not <Col N="1036" /> banned are available directly from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>EU Regulation 3093/94 provides for implementation of the Montreal Protocol within the EU and there are proposals for this regulation to be replaced. The new draft regulation provides measures which go further than the provisions of the Montreal Protocol, as amended, on the basis of experience in the implementation of the existing regulation and of progress in the availability of alternative substances.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the draft regulation are a reduction in the cap for placing products containing controlled substances covered by the regulation on the market from 2.6 per cent to 2 per cent of 1989 levels; tighter end-use controls; and a production freeze and phase-out schedule for HCFCs which includes a review clause in 2002; a phase-out of the production and consumption of methyl bromide by 2005 with a 60 per cent cut in 2001 and 75 per cent cut in 2003, with exemptions for critical uses continuing after 2005, and exemptions for quarantine and pre-shipment use; general prohibition on the placing on the market and use of CFCs and other fully halogenated substances; and further controls on trade in ODS.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports the EU position of accelerating the phase out of ODS where feasible and the adoption of the new regulation and will comply with its requirements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>Over all of my Department's relevant areas of responsibility the policies being pursued by me are aimed at promoting environmental sustainability. The areas of physical planning and construction are of particular relevance to these questions. The new Planning and Development Bill, 1999 will introduce a sustainable development philosophy to the Irish planning system. Among the measures designed to ensure that development follows sustainable development patterns are mandatory environmental objectives in development plans and the strategic environmental assessment of development plans and regional planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>The residential density guidelines published last week in final form promote more sustainable housing development through the avoidance of excessive suburbanisation and the promotion of higher density development in appropriate locations, especially in conjunction with improved public transport systems.</P>
      <P>In relation to construction, the forum for the construction industry has prepared a set of recommendations on sustainability and in conjunction with my Department is pursuing the implementation of these. These deal with issues such as incorporating the principles of sustainable development in project planning, site selection and brief development, including environmental costs, life cycle costs, etc. In early 2000, I intend publishing proposals to amend the building regulations and the technical guidance document on fuel efficiency and energy conservation to bring Ireland's insulation standards for new dwellings up to highest European standards on a phased basis. The Department is also sponsoring a sustainable building award as part of the annual construction excellence awards organised by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) and<i> Irish Building</i> magazine. The first award will be made later this year.</P>
      <P>My Department's aim, therefore, is to give effect to sustainability through the planning system and across the whole construction sector and thereby make all building development more sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome all proposals to increase housing supply and to create settlements in a more sus<Col N="1039" /> tainable way. My priority at present is to concentrate on measures which have the broadest possible impact. While the Irish Eco-village information network made a submission to my Department last year, I have not made an assessment of the potential contribution of the eco-village concept to sustainability.</P>

      <P>My Department recently issued an information mailshot to all registered owners of pre-1986 petrol engined vehicles advising them of the range of alternative options open to them, for example, lead substitute products such as lead replacement petrol or anti-wear additives and engine adjustments of various types. I also launched a national poster campaign in co-operation with the Irish Petroleum Industry Association for display in motor tax, vehicle registration and other local authority public offices, petrol stations, etc. highlighting the alternatives to leaded petrol. The oil industry has not indicated any anticipated problem with the phase-out of leaded petrol.

      <P>&ldquo;Cleaner Manufacturing Technologies in Ireland&rdquo; was issued in 1993 as a discussion document and I have no proposals at this time to commission or publish further such material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been significant developments in the area of cleaner production since 1993, arising from the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Technology Centre &ndash; Cork Institute of Technology and Cleaner Production Promotion Unit &ndash; UCC &ndash; in Cork, and Enterprise Ireland. Waste management legis<Col N="1040" /> lation and policy have also substantially advanced in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>The IPC licensing system operated by the EPA provides for progressive improvement in the environmental performance of licensable activities, and has to date resulted in the prevention of significant quantities of hazardous and other wastes. All IPC licensees are required to establish and maintain an environmental management system (EMS), assessing all operations and reviewing all practicable options for the use of cleaner technology, cleaner production and the minimisation of waste.</P>
    <P>Environmental management systems such as ISO 14001 and EMAS have been developed as tools to assist industry in managing its environmental affairs and provide a fully structured approach to controlling and improving environmental aspects of a company's operations, including production processes. The National Accreditation Board (the competent body for EMAS) and the EPA have produced a guidance document setting out a coherent approach to the auditing requirements of IPC licensing and EMAS, so that both can be addressed in a single combined audit.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the EPA presented the results of 14 cleaner production projects which had been supported under an EU co-funded cleaner production pilot demonstration programme. Information on the outcome of this programme was distributed to over 800 companies in the relevant production sectors.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland provides grant assistance towards the development and implementation of waste minimisation audits, and for research on the development of environmentally superior products.</P>
    <P>Under the Waste Management Act, 1996 local authorities are required to make waste management plans in respect of their functional areas, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan. Reflecting the waste hierarchy, the statutory objective of these plans is to; prevent or minimise the production and harmful nature of waste; encourage and support the recovery of waste, and ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safely disposed of. Local authorities generally are well advanced in the development and adoption of waste management plans, in most cases on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>The EPA recently published a proposed national hazardous waste management plan for public consultation over a two-month period. The cornerstone of the proposed plan is hazardous waste prevention and to this end the adoption of an ambitious hazardous waste prevention programme is recommended.</P>

      <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Licensing of Industrial Plant) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 266 of 1988), prohibit the operation of industrial plants used for the extraction or recovery, by burning or by the application of heat, of,<i> inter </i>alia, copper from any scrap metal or alloy, waste material or residue including scrap or waste cable, without a licence under the Act being in force. The Air Pollution Act, 1987 (No. 6 of 1987) defines industrial plant to include any land which is used for the purpose of an industrial process; industrial process is defined to include the recovery, by burning, of copper from scrap metal or alloy, waste material or waste cable.</P>
      <P>The licensing of such industrial plant and the enforcement of regulations made under the Act are matters for the relevant local authority. Local authorities have powers under sections 26 and 27 of the Act to prevent or limit air pollution affecting any part of their functional area or any adjoining area.</P>
      <P>In addition, depending on the circumstances, the burning of copper waste requires a licence from the environmental protection agency under the Environmental Protection Agency Act or the Waste Management Act, 1996, or a waste permit from the relevant local authority, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>EU Environment Ministers recently agreed a common position on a proposed directive on the incineration of waste, which aims to consolidate and extend the scope of existing directives relating to the incineration of municipal and hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government strongly supports the stringent operational controls and emission standards which are contained in this proposal, and looks forward to its early adoption by the community. Once adopted, this directive will be formally transposed into Irish legislation without delay.</P>
      <P>In any event however, high standards of environmental protection already apply in relation to the incineration of waste. The strict control regime which is provided for in the proposed directive has largely been anticipated under the integrated pollution control &ndash; IPC &ndash; licensing system operated by the environmental protection agency &ndash; EPA. The EPA may not grant an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the environment. Accordingly, I do not consider that any deferral along the lines suggested is warranted.</P>

      <P>On 27 July 1999, I published a consultation document on my proposal to amend part M of the national building regulations, 1997 to require new dwellings commencing on or after 1 July 2000 to be accessible to disabled visitors. The document sets out the proposed text of both the amending regulations and revised technical guidance on part M.</P>
      <P>In the consultation document, I also signalled my intention to review the operation of the existing part M in the light of experience since 1992; and invited proposals for changes.</P>
      <P>The deadline for comments under the consultation process is 29 October 1999. I would hope to announce definitive proposals relating to part M following consideration of comments received in consultation with the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB), early in the new year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I understand that the May 1999 guidelines issued by the Department of Education and Science relating to residential developments for third level students &ndash; eligible for tax incentives under Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999 &ndash; draw attention to the requirements of the existing part M and the pending development of part M.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no shortage of guidance available to those wishing to design and construct dwellings accessible to people with disabilities. In particular, I would draw the Deputy's attention to Technical Guidance Document M (1997 edition) published by my Department which includes advice on the design of the common areas of apartment <Col N="1047" /> blocks to comply with the existing accessibility provisions of part M; and &ldquo;Buildings for Everyone &ndash; Access and Use for all the Citizens&rdquo; (1998) published by the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB).</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who look after certain people who need full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1999 budget introduced some changes in the means test for carer's allowance. From <Col N="1049" /> August 1999, a disregard of £75 per week is applied to the income of a single carer and the current disregard of £150 per week is applied to the joint means of a married couple.</P>
    <P>The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. One of the major issues raised by these groups was the removal or easing of the carer's allowance means test.</P>
    <P>The complete abolition of the means test would have substantial cost implications. The review estimated that some £160 million would be required per annum to pay the basic maximum rate carer's allowance to the 40,000 carers providing full time care and attention. This is an additional £100 million on top of the estimated public expenditure in 1999 of £60 million.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income. In this regard it should be noted that the only universal social welfare scheme is child benefit. All other schemes are based on either contribution-qualification conditions or are means tested.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is not generally payable where a person is resident in an institution, where the cost of care and maintenance is being met in whole or in part by or on behalf of a health board. This provision has been a feature of the disability allowance, and of the former disabled person's maintenance allowance which it replaced. In cases where a person is in full-time institutional care the maintenance costs and an element of pocket money are met through funding from the health boards.</P>
      <P>Since the take-over of the disability allowance scheme from the health boards, a number of measures have been introduced to progressively relax this disqualification. Disability allowance now continues to be paid for up to 13 weeks where the recipient goes into hospital or institutional care for the purposes of undergoing medical or other treatment of a temporary nature. In addition, disability allowance is paid at half-rate in the case of those in part-time residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore under provisions contained in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, recipients of disability allowance who go into hospital or institutional <Col N="1050" /> care after 1 August 1999 will retain their full entitlement to the allowance.</P>

      <P>The Donegal Task Force was set up in September 1998 by the Tánaiste, following the announcement of over 700 redundancies in Fruit of the Loom. The task force's report was furnished to Government in July 1999.</P>
      <P>The task force made a number of recommendations in the economic area &ndash; infrastructure, agriculture, tourism, telecommunications etc. It also made a number of recommendations relating to human resource development, including the following priorities: reducing the rate of early school leaving, developing programmes to help workers to adapt/re-train for industrial change, continued training for the unemployed, and measures to retain graduates in the county.</P>
      <P>One of the report's medium-term recommendations was of relevance to my Department <i>viz</i> that the regulations regarding entitlement to benefits for people who are made redundant and wish to enter immediately onto re-skilling courses or second chance education should be re-examined.</P>
      <P>A minimum period on the live register has been a condition for access to my Department's second chance education opportunities since the schemes were first introduced in the mid 1980s. The minimum period has over the years been reduced from 15 months down to the current requirement of six months. The date by which the six months counts is the date the course starts, which can provide some flexibility in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By comparison with other schemes (e.g. the back-to-work allowance) the six-month period is relatively short. I am sure that Deputy will appreciate that, in equity, any reduction of this would need to apply generally, and not be confined to a particular area. Given the greater needs <Col N="1051" /> of those who are on the live register for longer, I do not favour reducing the qualifying period any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 309 to 312, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised in these are similar to those raised by the Deputy on 24 June 1999, to which I replied as comprehensively as possible. I am satisfied that the Department has already dealt with the correspondence to which the Deputy refers in so far as possible.</P>
      <P>In its report <i>Securing Retirement Income</i>, the Pensions Board considered that if a statutory requirement to revalue all pre-1991 service was placed on pension schemes, the additional costs involved for schemes with many deferred pensioners and few current members, could be considerable in percentage of payroll terms and could threaten the solvency of a scheme in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue of revaluation of deferred benefits for members of occupational pension schemes who left such schemes prior to 1991, when the Pensions Act, 1990, came into <Col N="1052" /> effect, the usual position is that leaving service benefits are calculated by reference to the period of scheme membership and salary at the time of leaving and are not subject to revaluation. The Pensions Board examined the issue of early leavers but did not recommend a statutory requirement to revalue all pre-1991 rights. However, the board urged employers to consider the revaluation of such benefits, where people remain members of the scheme, on a voluntary basis. In this regard I do not understand the figure of 86 per cent in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board comprises representatives of scheme trustees, scheme members, the pensions industry, the social partners and representatives of Departments and represents the balance of interest between these groups. The Pensions Board is the regulatory authority responsible for the regulation of occupational pension schemes, as set out in the Pensions Act, 1990. However, while pension schemes have to comply with this Act, the schemes themselves are arrangements set up on a voluntary basis between employers and employees and governed in the first instance by the terms of the relevant trust deed, which is overseen by the scheme trustees.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board recommended that it should remain permissible for an employer who is contributing to a pension scheme to have or make it a condition on taking up employment that employees join the pension scheme. The board considered this condition to be essential to avoid the possibility of unscrupulous attempts to tempt people out of employer-sponsored schemes as happened in the United Kingdom for example, where employers were legally prohibited from having scheme membership as a condition of employment. I fully support the pensions board recommendation in this regard. Overall, the objective is to increase the coverage of good occupational schemes, as outlined by the board in its report.</P>
    <P>I plan to publish a pensions Bill as early as possible in 2000 which will address many of the outstanding issues in the area of occupational pensions, including the establishment of a pensions ombudsman, which would be of assistance in certain areas of pension disputes.</P>

      <P>The household budget scheme is available to recipients of social welfare payments who are paid through electronic payments systems operated by An Post.</P>
      <P>The household budget scheme is a facility under which certain social welfare recipients can have agreed deductions made at source from their payments and paid over to certain nominated organisations. The deductions are made by An Post who also generate the payment to the nominated organisation.</P>
      <P>The scheme involves automatic computer-generated deductions and can only apply where customers are paid through An Post using electronic payment systems. At present the scheme is available to unemployed persons who are generally paid through post offices and to recipients of one parent family payments, invalidity pension and disability allowance who opt to be paid through a card-based electronic payment system. The scheme will be extended to other social welfare payments as soon as the necessary computer developments can be carried out after the year 2000 transition.</P>
      <P>The payments which can be made under the system are rent/mortgage payments to local authorities or recognised housing associations and payments to the ESB, Bord Gáis and Eircom.</P>
      <P>The scheme is available to eligible customers nationwide. All of the major local authorities operate the scheme as do 41 of the 49 urban district councils. The UDCs not included at present are Clonakilty, Fermoy, Kinsale, Midleton, Youghal, Ballinasloe, Castleblayney and Birr. However, eligible customers in these towns can avail of the scheme for the utilities mentioned previously.</P>
      <P>The household budget scheme is working well and there are 82 local authorities using the scheme at present with some £276,000 collected each week by deduction.</P>
      <P>The overall number availing of the scheme currently stands at 14,774.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Widow(er)s non-contributory pension is a means-tested assistance payment and, as such, all income, including income from other pensions, is assessable as means. Where the means of a non-contributory pensioner increase for any reason s/he is obliged to inform my Department so that the rate of pension may be adjusted if necessary.</P>
      <P>As part of its ongoing programme of control measures the Department periodically reviews the means of non-contributory pensioners.</P>
      <P>This year a review of widow(er) non-contributory pensioners who are also in receipt of other pensions is being conducted. Approximately 850 pensioners who are also in receipt of a British widows or British retirement pension will have their entitlement reviewed.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension at the rate of £60.50 a week. This is the rate of pension appropriate to a person with means of between £22 and £24 a week. She is also in receipt of a living alone and fuel allowance. Her entitlement to pension was last reviewed in 1993 when her British pension was £25.80 stg a week.</P>
      <P>A deciding officer has reviewed the entitlement of the person concerned to widow's non-contributory pension as part of the review process outlined above. Her British pension has increased since the last review of her means in 1993. A letter has accordingly issued to the person concerned advising her that her widow's non-contributory pension is due to be reduced to £34.50. This is the rate of pension due to a person with means of between £48 and £50 a week. She will also continue to have entitlement to living alone and fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has written to the <Col N="1057" /> Department to appeal against the proposed reduction in pension. A deciding officer will now make a decision in the matter, taking on board the views expressed by the person concerned. She will have a right of appeal against this decision.</P>

      <Quest>the compensation available to land owners in areas designated as special areas of conservation in view of the land use restrictions associated with this designation; the consultation process, if any, that was involved in this designation process; if it is possible to opt out of this designation; and, if so, the process whereby this may occur.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Habitats Directive &ndash; 92/43/EEC &ndash; requires all member states to participate in establishing an EU wide network of ecological sites; this network is known as the Natura 2000 Network. The directive specifies habitats and species for which the member states must designate special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs. The selection of land for this designation is based solely on scientific grounds. In Ireland, the sites are largely selected from the existing proposed natural heritage areas &ndash; NHAs.</P>
      <P>My Department has consulted with the farming and conservation organisations, and with the social partners, prior to, and subsequent to, advertising any proposed SAC. In addition, where landowners agree, liaison committees have been, and will be, established for the sites. My Department continues to meet organisations and individuals in connection with the proposals. I can assure the Deputy that full consultation has taken place, and will continue to take place.</P>
      <P>The directive requires the member states to ensure that no activity or development, likely to have a significant adverse impact on a site's conservation value, may take place other than for reasons of overriding public interest.</P>
      <P>Where the inclusion of land in an SAC causes an income loss the Government is committed to ensuring that a fair and proper level of compensation shall be paid having regard to the level, and extent of restriction. If an individual is unhappy with the amount of compensation s/he may have the matter referred to an arbitrator. It is anticipated that these proposed designations will not affect the majority of land owners, and land users, as their activities are, in general, already compatible with the conservation of these important ecological areas and I wish to emphasise that, where it is necessary to impose restrictions, full compensation will be paid for actual income losses.</P>
      <P>The obligations imposed by the directive precludes the possibility of opting out of the proposed designation. However, I have no desire to include land in these sites unless it fully meets the criteria listed in the directive. To this end I have established an informal process whereby land owners, and land users, may object to the inclusion of their lands in these sites, on scientific grounds. I have also established an Appeals Advisory Board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former ombudsman, to whom individuals may refer their case if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the informal process. This board is comprised of an equal number of representatives from farming/development interests and conservation interests; where possible the board will also have local representatives of both interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy, also, that appli<Col N="1061" /> cations for planning permission will continue to be decided by the local authorities and An Bórd Pleanála; activities licensed by other State bodies will continue to be licensed by those bodies.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to forward, for the Deputy's information, a note on the compensation scheme and the system whereby objections may be made to the proposals.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Donegal Employment Initiative was finalised earlier this year and was presented to Government by the Tánaiste in July. Bord Fáilte has already agreed to support the work of the initiative by way of substantial additional marketing funding to support tourism development in Donegal, and CERT by way of specially tailored courses for displaced Fruit of the Loom workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in welcoming the report, stated that the Government had decided that all relevant Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities it proposed in drafting the operational programmes of the national development plan. Accordingly, in so far as individual elements of the report relate to my own portfolio, I will be having priorities as identified in the report considered by my Department in the context of the drafting of its input into operational programme for the Border, midland <Col N="1066" /> and western region under the next national development plan.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report recommended a seven year development strategy based on a comprehensive analysis of the development challenges facing Donegal. The Government is committed to focusing all the strengths of the State's development agencies on County Donegal to address its job creation and development needs. These efforts are beginning to bear considerable fruit. Since the establishment of the initiative, the Tánaiste has already announced a number of new projects for the county with the potential to generate over 500 jobs. It is the Government's intention that this momentum should be maintained.</P>

      <P>Youth organisations receive funding from my Department in the form of grant-in-aid under three main schemes &ndash; the youth service grant scheme, the scheme for projects to assist disadvantaged youth and the young people's facilities and services fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The youth service grant scheme provides non-capital funding to national youth organisations, and it is a matter for the organisation in receipt <Col N="1067" /> of funds to ensure the appropriate financial support for its projects, programmes, project workers, and affiliated groups, having regard to the overall level of grant aid available. The funding for this scheme in 1999 is £5,738,243.</P>
    <P>The scheme for projects to assist disadvantaged youth provides non-capital funding to projects in rural and urban areas. A sum of £6,949,846 has been provided for this scheme in 1999.</P>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund will provide £35 million over three years, 1999 &ndash; 2001. The purpose of the fund is to develop youth facilities, including sports and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. Funding of over £13 million will go towards the building and refurbishment of youth, community and sports facilities. Over the three years of the fund, 86 capital projects will receive funding, including 41 youth centres, 25 community centres and 20 sports facilities.</P>
    <P>My Department has also recently announced a new pilot local youth clubs grant scheme. The scheme will provide support for youth work activities at local level by making grant aid available to youth clubs and groups. The funding for the scheme, which will be administered by the vocational education committees, is £300,000 in 1999, and it will provide a valuable source of direct funding for individual youth clubs and groups throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation also provides funds for a youth and sports grant scheme which is also administered by the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>The national guidelines place an onus on statutory and voluntary-community organisations to draw up local guidelines to complement the national guidelines and to make them as effective and meaningful as possible. In this respect, officials within my Department have been meeting with the partners in education and representatives of the health boards over the past number of months with a view to revising the guidelines that issued to schools in 1991 and which set out the procedures to be followed in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In carrying out this review close contact has been maintained with the Department of Health <Col N="1071" /> and Children working group that produced the new national guidelines. The review is currently nearing completion and it is hoped that updated guidelines for schools will be finalised within a short period of time. I confirm that the new guidelines for schools will take account of the recommendations contained in the national guidelines.</P>
    <P>Once the updated guidelines for schools are finalised it is intended that they will be issued to schools in a set that would also contain a copy of the national guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The annual higher education grants scheme, which I approve, sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions. However, there are a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to the scope of the scheme must be considered in the light of overall resource constraints and the competing demands within the education sector. My priorities in the area of student support have been to introduce a maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses from the 1998-99 academic year and to address the position of mature students under the various grant schemes from the current academic year. I would also remind the Deputy that this Government has funded a major increase in the number of places in public colleges.</P>
      <P>The question of the non-inclusion of courses in private colleges within the free fees initiative is at issue in the case of Patrick Jordan Junior, Patrick Jordan Senior, Raymond Kearns and Barry <i>v</i>. the Minister for Education, Ireland and the Attorney General and I do not consider it appropriate to make a statement in the matter. I understand that the case has not as yet been set down for hearing and accordingly I do not know when the case will be concluded.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would mention that tax relief is available for tuition fees paid by students who are attending private third level colleges. Such students, or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of tax relief, at the standard rate, on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy the prescribed codes of standards and are approved by me .</P>

Travelling expenses, at the appropriate civil service rates of motor mileage allowance, are paid to such teachers in respect of the use of their cars for travelling to the schools to which they are assigned, other than their base school. Travel expenses are not allowed in respect of travelling between the teachers' home and their base schools.</P>
      <P>Payment for travelling from home to schools, other than the base school to which the teachers are assigned, are made in respect of any distance travelled which is in excess of the distance which would be covered in travelling from their homes to their base school.</P>
      <P>Given the number of remedial teachers who are now serving groups of schools; the variety of geographical arrangements which can be involved; and the need for consistency in approaching the associated travel costs issue, I am satisfied that the adoption of the base school approach outlined above represents the most suitable way of dealing with this matter.

      <P>Teachers undertaking remedial duties in primary schools are required to be fully qualified primary teachers. The pre-service training undertaken by all such teachers in the teacher training colleges includes specific modules on literacy and numeracy and addresses the methods to be employed by teachers in meeting the needs of children with difficulties in those areas.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, there has been a national programme of training in the remedial area for serving teachers at primary and post-primary levels. Under this programme teachers attend postgraduate courses in the following institutions:</P>

      <P>The number of graduates from these courses over the two years 1998 and 1999 was 148 and 158 respectively.</P>
      <P>There were 394 applications for places on the above mentioned courses for the 1999-2000 academic year. Of these, 172 applicants were given places on the courses. Many of the remaining 222 applicants were not eligible under the terms of the programme.</P>
      <P>Many shorter courses for remedial and other interested teachers in specific learning areas continue to be supported financially by my Department. These are provided mainly through the network of education centres, teachers' organisations and the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not have details of newly appointed remedial teachers who have not received training in remedial teaching methods. <Col N="1077" /> The Department will be examining the overall situation following the receipt of the school returns due this month, and steps will be taken to provide any further necessary training in the area.</P>

    <P>Mr. R. Bruton asked the Minister for Education and Science if, in implementing his recent decision regarding home school liaison teachers for disadvantaged schools, he has required the schools to provide a full-time teacher to carry out these details but has only allocated half a post to the school for the purpose, which effectively requires them to reduce their teaching staff by half of a teacher in order to implement this measure. [18790/99]</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>All second level schools designated as disadvantaged have been invited to participate in the home school community liaison scheme this year. Participation in the scheme requires that the school concerned assigns a teacher full-time &ndash; 22 hours per week &ndash; as home school liaison co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>Participating schools which have been allocated disadvantaged posts are required to allocate 0.5 of the disadvantaged post to home school liaison and my Department has allocated an additional 0.5 of a post so that the full-post requirement can be met. The Deputy will note that it is already a requirement of the disadvantaged post that 0.5 of the post be used for home-school duties.</P>
      <P>My Department appreciates that certain schools may have difficulty in assigning a teacher full-time to the liaison co-ordinator post in the current school year. It has been agreed that, where this is so, the school concerned may participate in the scheme this year subject to a teacher being assigned to home school liaison duties for a minimum 11 hours per week and an undertaking being given that deployment will be on a full-time basis from the beginning of the 2000-01 school year. Schools that are not in a position to participate in the liaison scheme this year will be invited to participate in the 2000-01 school year provided participation will be on a full-time basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the package to tackle educational disadvantage which I announced some months ago provided for the <Col N="1078" /> appointment of an additional 225 second level teachers in the current school year to enable the move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school-community liaison in all disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The package is being resourced by allocating an additional teaching provision to schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate remedial and home-school provision. In the case of schools with over quota teachers who might otherwise be redeployed, this resource is being utilised in the first instance to meet the remedial and home-school needs of the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>In the case of schools which have on their staff over quota permanent teachers following implementation of the above package, a retention ratio of 18:1 is applied to determine whether or not these teachers come within the terms of the redeployment scheme. This was stated at the time</P>
      <P>of the announcement of the extension of the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>

      <P>The question of allocating additional resources to individual schools within a particular VEC is a matter in the first instance for the chief executive officer, with the agreement of the committee.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced some months ago that all second level schools in the free education scheme would be entitled to an automatic allocation in respect of remedial.</P>
      <P>This provision was put into effect for the 1999-2000 school year. The allocation to individual schools has been determined by the enrolment in the school. Schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils have been allocated a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 have been allocated 0.5 of a post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this arrangement, the school to which <Col N="1079" /> the Deputy refers qualifies for the allocation of 0.5 of a post in respect of remedial and the appropriate allocation was included in the overall teacher allocation to County Meath VEC for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

Schools with a pupil teacher ratio below 10:1 are free to make a case for such support to my Department.</P>
      <P>An educational psychological service is not yet available to primary schools in County Roscommon. I formally established a National Educational Psychological Service Agency on 1 September 1999. The process of recruiting additional psychologists for the agency has begun and interviews for new posts are being held. The development of this new service must occur on a phased basis. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the service by the end of a five year period. It is hoped that there will be a nucleus of an educational psychological service in every county by the end of 1999. The National Educational Psychological Service will be organised on a regional basis in consultation with the clinical psychological service of the health boards who will continue to provide a service to parents and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1998 I announced a £57 million two year funding initiative to tackle education disadvantage at all levels. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the measures announced.</P>
      <P>At primary level the following measures have benefited from the initiative: the home school community liaison scheme has been extended to all schools designated as disadvantaged; the remedial teaching service has been extended to all primary schools &ndash; there are now 1,465 posts in place; a resource teaching service is now available to all special needs children with assessed levels of disability; in advance of the White Paper on early education, the provision of early education for children with disabilities has commenced; funding for the provision of escorts and safety harnesses for all children with disabilities travelling on special school and special class transport services has issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, provision has been made for <Col N="1081" /> 225 additional teaching posts and this is being implemented.</P>
    <P>In the third level sector, within the overall disadvantage fund of £57 million £6.9 million was provided to tackle educational disadvantage. Of this amount £2.4 million is being used to extend the maintenance grants scheme so that all independent mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant from the current academic year. A further £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. My Department has had discussions with the access officers of the colleges, the Union of Students in Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and other interested bodies in relation to this funding, and I hope to be in a position to finalise the arrangements in the near future.</P>
    <P>As part of the third level package, a further £1.5 million is being provided over two years to address the issue of non-completion of courses in important parts of the third level system. The Department is currently engaged in discussions with institutes of technology with regard to the measures for which this funding will be used.</P>
    <P>In addition, in agreeing to an increase in the student services charge for this year it has been indicated to institutes of technology that £8 of this charge is to be specifically devoted to attrition/access initiatives in the institutes. The institutes have been requested to furnish the proposals for the attrition/access initiatives in this context at an early date.</P>

      <P>The report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the role of education providers and, in particular, Letterkenny Institute of Technology. The report recommends the expansion of the number of places at Letterkenny Institute of Technology. The number of students at the institute has increased from 1,250 in 1994-95 to over 1,800 in the current academic year. A number of new diploma and degree programmes have also been introduced over that period.</P>

    <P>Child care provision for VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller participants has been provided in Buncrana and Letterkenny, and the adult literacy provision has been increased. County Donegal Vocational Education Committee is examining further measures in this context. It is intended that initiatives in the field of second chance education will be further expanded in the light of developments under the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>Capital developments costing £13.5 million have been funded in Letterkenny Institute of Technology since 1990 and further capital funding of £4 million has been made available for the next phase of the institute's campus development.</P>

      <P>Currently, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme for the employment of secretaries which was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this scheme a number of primary schools qualified for a shared secretary and Scoil Áine, Raheny, is currently involved in a sharing arrangement with Scoil Eithne, Edenmore. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full-time secretaries in posts which are being shared.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial services.</P>
      <P>Should the existing post fall vacant, my Department will provide Scoil Áine and Scoil Eithne with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost of secretarial services, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school, in accordance with the terms of the PESP scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the inequity of the capitation grants payable to mainstream national schools and gaelscoileanna; if his attention has been drawn to the concerns relating to the higher pupil-teacher ratio and lower capitation grants pertaining to mainstream schools compared to gaelscoileanna; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have attributed great importance to the development of the Irish language and in this context the Gaelscoileanna movement has been very significant in strengthening the position of Irish in the educational system.</P>
      <P>Gaelscoileanna have, therefore, traditionally received a higher rate of capitation grant than that which applies to mainstream schools because of their role in the promotion of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I have substantially improved the level of capitation grants since taking office. The standard rate of capitation grant, which was £45 per pupil in 1997, now stands at £60 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The favourable pupil teacher ratio is designed to assist Gaelscoileanna deal with difficulties inherent in teaching through Irish pupils whose home language is not Irish. In this regard the Deputy will appreciate that I have implemented very significant reductions in class sizes generally. As a result of my most recent initiative, which comes into effect this year based on September 1998 enrolments, all schools will operate to a maximum class average of 30 pupils.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a member of the public and her public representation have been ignored by a public body (details supplied); if he will ensure that the refund due to the person concerned is paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the refund in this case refers to an application made to a VEC for refund of adult education course fees. My Department has been in contact with the VEC concerned, which is the responsible body in this case, and I understand the vocational education committees position in relation to the refund sought is as follows.</P>
      <P>As the overall programme of part-time evening courses is required to be self-financing, minimum class numbers are set and refunds are not allowed subsequent to enrolment. To ensure maximum information-understanding for potential students, advisers are present on enrolment night to assist applicants in relation to the subject matter of a course and in respect of the conditions pertaining to enrolments, including the fact that fees are not refundable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the VEC has indicated that a fee refund application and letter of appeal was sub<Col N="1087" /> mitted by the applicant. A full response was made to the applicant on 8 June 1999. In its response the VEC advised that, although a refund of fees was not available, it was prepared to offer the applicant a place on any of <Col N="1088" /> its evening courses for the year 1999-2000, subject to viability.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the VEC that inquiries by the Deputy were responded to by the former chief executive officer on 8 April 1999 and 18 June 1999.</P>
