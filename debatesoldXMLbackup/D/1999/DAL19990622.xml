      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the total number of staff serving in his Department; the reason for any changes in numbers since 1 January 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently 171 staff serving in my Department. This figure does not include officers serving in organisations under the aegis of my Department or on secondment to other Departments or bodies. Since January 1999 there have been 27 appointments. Almost half were assigned to the clerical officer grade to fill outstanding vacancies which arose during 1998. The remaining appointments, at both clerical and administrative levels, were in respect of vacancies which existed due to resignations, secondments, transfers and staff opting for career breaks or job-sharing and the appointment of two additional administrative staff in the IT division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments finding difficulty filling positions at clerical officer level in view of the fact that the pay rates are more attractive outside the public sector for that type of work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have apologised to the Ceann Comhairle at the outset. We had some difficulty forming a quorum because two Oireachtas committees met early today, namely the Select Committee on Education and Science and the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difficulty on the staffing side, particularly in regard to clerical officers. The commission is finding it necessary to go a substantial way down the list before they can get suitable people for the jobs. People sit exams but do not subsequently take up appointments. That was the <Col N="830" /> case in 1997 and 1998 and is still the case. There has been a 15 per cent turnover in staff within Departments as greater opportunities are now available to people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Government propose to do about the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An examination of the 1956 Act is currently ongoing. Many of the procedures are outdated. The secretary to the Government, who is a civil service commissioner, is examining that together with other people. We did not experience these difficulties when we had an unemployment rate of 18 per cent. However, given that the rate of unemployment is now running at 5 per cent, the situation is very different. Greater numbers of young people are now staying in third level education. That is a good thing but it means there is a lack of interest in the clerical officer grade. Because of the opportunities now available in the private sector and the huge increase in employment, people who have attained a few year's experience move into the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that job descriptions should be changed? People who previously served as clerical officers are now taking on executive roles in the private sector, with the aid of modern information technology. Regardless of pay rates, people will not be attracted into employment in which they do not have effective responsibility. Part of the difficulty may be that people who are recruited as clerical assistants and clerical officers in the public service do not have the responsibilities and opportunities to progress which people have starting out in the private sector. The problem relates not merely to pay, but to an outdated public service organisational structure which does not take the potential of information technology into account in allowing power and responsibility to be delegated to the lowest level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1956 Act is dated. The procedures in the timing of examinations and recruitment competitions can be improved upon. In the past, people tended to stay on in the Civil Service, which they viewed as a career, but with the opportunities which are now available to them they move on. Many people have IT skills.</P>
      <P>The private sector is clearly very keen on public service employees. I have watched this trend grow over several years and have spoken to colleagues and senior civil servants about it. Many civil servants are not applying for jobs but are being targeted by the private sector. That is not necessarily a bad thing and is an indication that people within the public sector and Civil Service possibly have greater skills and expertise than those in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not ever witnessed such a degree of movement within the Civil Service. Because people are leaving the service, those who would <Col N="831" /> formerly have been stuck in the clerical assistant grade are advancing through the system very quickly. That is a good thing. Perhaps our procedures are not as efficient as they might be; they certainly have not ever been used in the past to the same extent as they are now. People are going through the interview process in something of an ongoing whirl. This situation has arisen because more jobs and more attractive salaries are now available. I agree with the Deputy that pay is not the only issue involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the numbers employed in his Department, is it the Taoiseach's intention to fill the vacancy of personal adviser created by the resignation of Mr. Duffy? Have all temporary employees in his Department signed a contract? Will he also confirm that he is the first Taoiseach to appoint a personal usher? Will he explain exactly what a personal usher does for a Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He rounds up Fianna Fáil Deputies for Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every employee should sign a contract. As I explained last week, some contracts were not signed because a number of issues remained outstanding. I also said that such contracts should be signed and that any outstanding issues could be dealt with later. I have given instructions to this effect. I have not given any thought to the vacancy created by Mr. Duffy's resignation but I intend to fill it as a gap has been left. I understood the usher who moved from Leinster House to my floor did so on appointment. He does what every other usher did before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at the height of his grandest illusions of grandeur Mr. Haughey did not employ a personal tipstaff. Does the Taoiseach not consider that it is an unnecessary position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a hard neck. He knows how many staff the Government of which he was a member employed. On the individual who moved from Leinster House, the reason listed is &ldquo;for the purpose of questions&rdquo;. This role has always been played by a member of staff. There are no additional duties. He does not do anything special to make life easier for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was this not necessary for any of the Taoiseach's predecessors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a new appointment which was listed when the individual concerned moved from Leinster House. The individual concerned is part of the Taoiseach's staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the reason it is listed as a personal appointment that the Taoiseach requested <Col N="832" /> the appointment of the individual concerned? Does he possess a particular skill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the ushers in Leinster House possess particular skills. Because the individual concerned moved to the other side of the corridor, the appointment was listed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach request that the individual concerned be appointed as his personal usher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that the usher asked to be transferred to my domain on the other side of the corridor. I presume the usher he replaced moved somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the usher in question well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he has similar luck in the national lottery to some of his colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach. On the recruitment of clerical officers and clerical assistants which presents a serious problem for the public service, is it not the case that while non-pay issues are part of the problem, pay is a big part? Is it not the case also that because the union involved settled early the staff concerned have lost out on some of the extra pay increases granted to those who did not settle early? There are issues of equity and efficiency. The Taoiseach and the Government need to tackle the problems of the lowest paid officials in Departments. This issue requires attention in the interests of the effective running of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ongoing discussions concerning those who settled early. The Government has been fair in a number of these cases. This issue mainly concerns lower grades but, unlike in the past, people have moved up through the ranks in Departments because opportunities exist. I am conscious of lower paid staff in the public service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As outlined in my comprehensive statement to the Dáil last Tuesday, I attended the European Council in Cologne on 3 and 4 June. We had a useful discussion with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Gil Robles, on the important role which the European Parliament will play, given its extended powers under the Amsterdam Treaty. During the first working session we had an indepth discussion of European security and defence policy. The common strategy for Russia, reform of the Commission, East Timor and relations with Turkey and Ukraine were also discussed. In the second working session, we discussed the European employment pact, institutional reform, the next Intergovernmental Conference and the proposed charter of fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finnish President, Mr. Ahtisaari, joined the Council following his peace talks in Belgrade with President Milosevic at which he was <Col N="834" /> accompanied by Mr. Chernomyrdin. We had a long discussion about the situation in Kosovo and the progress taking place while the summit was in session towards agreement by the Yugoslav authorities of the peace plan. We issued a declaration on Kosovo after the Council which highlighted the urgent need for the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on this matter. This is the approach which had been advocated by Ireland and which has now successfully been put in place with the adoption by the Security Council of Resolution 1244 on 10 June. It was also an approach suggested by the Greek Prime Minister in a letter to his EU counterparts in advance of the summit. We also discussed the broader Balkan region and the European Council endorsed the progress towards the stability pact for south-eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>On the subject of enlargement, a positive message was sent to all 11 accession states. In relation to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus, a commitment was given to open negotiations in all remaining areas covered by the <i>acquis</i> as early as possible next year. The Helsinki European Council in December will examine the progress made by all the accession candidates. It is crucial for stability in Europe that the momentum towards enlargement is maintained.</P>
    <P>An issue of key interest to Ireland at the Council was the declaration on strengthening the common European policy on security and defence. The declaration agreed at Cologne reflects a common analysis among EU member states of the objectives we seek on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty, effectively peacekeeping and crisis management, and how best to achieve these objectives. The declaration issued takes account of the views and positions of all four non-NATO EU member states.</P>
    <P>The summit also approved Mr. Javier Solana for the new post of Secretary General of the Council and High Representative for CFSP. Mr. Pierre de Boissieu was appointed as Deputy Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The summit discussed the scope, preparations and timetable for the next intergovernmental conference and the proposed EU charter of fundamental rights. The summit was also attended by the Commission President designate, Mr. Prodi, who discussed with the HOSGs the future work and required reforms of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The summit reached agreement on the European employment pact. Most of the goals which it sets already underpin the ongoing economic and social policy objectives pursued in this country, especially in the context of social partnership. I am very supportive of the more important role outlined for social partners at EU level.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in my statement, I took the opportunity to strongly support the extension of the duty free regime and drew attention to the difficulties caused by the decision to bring it to an end. Unfortunately, the outcome on duty free was very disappointing. Unanimity would have <Col N="835" /> been required to reverse abolition but our efforts to secure an extension of the current regime met with resistance from other member states, particularly Denmark.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the intention of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Barak, to resume negotiations with the Palestinians and Syrians and to seek a solution to the problem of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. Discussed also were issues related to the World Trade Organisation. In particular, the Council gave a strong endorsement of the efforts being made by China and Russia to achieve World Trade Organisation accession.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Blair on the evening of Wednesday, 2 June in Cologne. In addition to matters related to Northern Ireland, we discussed many of the issues on the agenda for the Council, including aspects of the Kosovo situation and duty free.</P>
    <P>My Department is in constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies in relation to developments on the EU agenda. As I outlined in my statement, in advance of the Cologne Council I established a Cabinet committee to co-ordinate EU business. Its core members are the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Foreign Affairs. In addition to matters related to Northern Ireland, we discussed many of the issues on the agenda for the Council, including aspects of the Kosovo situation and duty free sales.</P>
    <P>My Department is in constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies abroad about developments on the EU agenda. As I outlined in my statement, in advance of the Cologne Council I established a Cabinet committee to co-ordinate EU business. Its core members are the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In addition, the Attorney General and other Ministers will attend, as appropriate, on particular issues. This forum will allow for the required focus to be given to the important issues arising on the EU agenda. The committee's first meeting took place in preparation for the summit.</P>
    <P>I will attend a special meeting of the European Council on 15 and 16 October in Tampere, Finland. The Tampere summit will be the second occasion on which an EU summit has been devoted to one topic. The Council will evaluate progress achieved and give further direction to the actions of the EU in the area of justice and home affairs. We look forward to the discussions which we will have in Tampere on the action plan for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice and on the report of the high level working group on asylum and migration. The Cabinet committee will meet in advance of the October summit.</P>
    <P>Interdepartmental meetings at official level will also take place. A senior level meeting between Finnish, German, Council secretariat and Com<Col N="836" /> mission officials and representatives from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already taken place as part of initial consultations by the Finnish Presidency on preparations for Tampere. With regard to wider plans for the Finnish Presidency of the EU, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will receive Foreign Minister Halonen of Finland in Dublin tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have had to cancel my plans to attend the EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro on 28 and 29 June, due to negotiations between the parties in Northern Ireland for which a deadline of 30 June has been set. I must make myself available to provide whatever assistance I can to the parties in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government will be represented at the EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, accompanied by relevant officials from those Departments. The summit will be the first ever between the two regions. It is intended to launch a new strategic partnership providing for enhanced co-operation in political, economic and cultural spheres. In view of the summit's importance, I requested that the Tánaiste represent me and that she conduct the bilateral meetings which I had planned to hold with a number of Latin American and Caribbean heads of state or government. Arrangements for these bilateral meetings have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>On 16 June, I met a delegation of the foreign affairs committee of the National People's Congress of China. We exchanged views on a range of bilateral and multilateral issues. Most of our discussions centred on economic and trade matters. Naturally, we also spoke about my visit to China last year. We discussed human rights, Tibet and Kosovo. I extended my condolences to the delegation on the loss of life in the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the four neutral EU states. I am anxious to ascertain his understanding of Irish neutrality. How does he define it? Does he consider Ireland to have been neutral in the recent conflict between NATO and Serbia? Does he believe Ireland will be neutral, in the current sense, ten years from now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cologne declaration was discussed at the general affairs Council and the neutral countries worked together on it. From our point of view and in common with the other neutral states, we are as militarily neutral after the Cologne declaration as we were before it. We did not change our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland follows a policy of military neutrality although it has not ever been ideologically neutral or morally indifferent to the major international issues of the day. That has been its his<Col N="837" /> tory for the past 50 years. The Cologne declaration represents the objective of making a reality of the Amsterdam Treaty which was passed by the Irish people. There is nothing in that treaty or in the Cologne declaration that conflicts with Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>The core defining characteristic of Irish neutrality has always been non-membership of military alliances and that remains the position. Our neutrality goes hand in hand with a strong commitment to international co-operation for stability and security. That has been the policy of successive Irish Governments of whatever hue and I believe it will continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to how I envisage the Irish position in ten years, co-operation among European countries will continue to develop in terms of peacekeeping under the Petersberg Tasks. Ireland will also continue to take a line from the UN resolutions and I hope people will try harder to secure such resolutions than, perhaps, they sometimes do. I accept it is not easy. I have spoken previously in the House about Kofi Annan's views on reform. I am equally aware that it is easy to talk about these matters in the EU but it is difficult to achieve success in them. Over the next decade, the emphasis will be on co-operation in the EU on the Petersberg Tasks. Participation is voluntary and is a sovereign decision for each member state to make, and that will continue to be the case. It will also continue to be the case that decisions will be made by sovereign countries on a case by case basis. Now that the Amsterdam Treaty is in force, the EU is capable of making effective and timely decisions under the Petersberg Tasks. That will develop as time goes on.</P>

      <P>I am still in the dark as to what the Taoiseach understands by neutrality in the context of EU membership. Is it not the case that the declaration agreed in Cologne, in common with previous declarations of the European Union, in which Ireland participated and with which it agreed, commits the Union to a common defence policy as an objective? Does the Taoiseach believe that, if Ireland were to participate in the framing of a common defence policy with our EU members, we would still be neutral?</P>

      <P>Even in these discussions, the neutral countries such as Ireland have a major input such as we had in discussions on the Amsterdam Treaty. We should not adopt an isolationist view. Our position over the years &ndash; the records of both Houses prove this &ndash; is that we are militarily neutral because we have not been involved in ideological arguments about mutual defence. We have always taken the view with regard to peacekeeping missions&mdash;</P>

While he is entitled to his view which he believes to be right, I believe he is wrong. The Irish position on this matter has been, and will continue to be, that the European Union must work for peace, stability and security in Europe. The key to this is peacekeeping and crisis management within the context of the Petersberg Tasks. That was the motivating factor behind the work on the Amsterdam Treaty, the file on which I read last summer. It was also the motivating factor in 1990 and 1991 behind the work on the Maastricht Treaty. It was the same position of peace, stability and security.</P>
      <P>All 15 member states can play an active role which is in keeping with their traditions and capabilities. That was the basis of the discussions and the declaration takes account of the views and positions of all non-NATO EU member states. We worked closely with those countries in the discussions. I have already said what I believe will evolve over ten years. The capabilities will change as matters progress, but I believe the basis of the Petersberg Tasks &ndash; peace and security &ndash; will be maintained.</P>

      <P>The Cologne Declaration will not prejudice the eventual relationship between the EU and the Western European Union.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this matter revolves around fundamental difficulties in respect of Article V. On the last occasion we discussed Article V, I did not have a copy of it in my possession. For the record, Article V, which emanates from the modified Brussels Treaty, states that if any of the high contracting parties should be the object of an armed attack in Europe, the other high contracting parties will, in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, afford the party so attacked all the military and other aid and assistance in their power. This article has been in existence since the 1950s and is binding only on members of the Western European Union. It is not binding on Ireland.</P>
      <P>Article V is an automatic mutual defence commitment. When he was dealing with this matter in the mid-1950s, Seán Lemass stated that it would be incompatible with Ireland's policy of military neutrality to sign up to Article V, and we did not do so. Ireland and other neutral states cannot agree with the Western European Union becoming part of the EU because Article V would automatically put in place an automatic mutual defence commitment.</P>
      <P>To be fair and honest, people must consider the history of the position adopted by Ireland, which has been consistent for 45 years. While changes have been introduced as a result of the Amsterdam and Maastricht Treaties, Article V of the basic treaty has not changed and neither has our position. I hope that remains the case.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the aftermath of the war in Kosovo it is important that not only should the House debate the future security architecture of Europe but that it should also engage with the Irish people in that debate? Does he agree that each party in the House has a responsibility to lead that debate because, ultimately, any change in Ireland's neutral status will require the consent of the Irish people by way of referendum?</P>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's initial reply, did the Taoiseach raise Ireland's ongoing concerns about the operation of Sellafield with the British Prime Minister at the Cologne summit? Did he raise that issue with the German Chancellor in view of the possibility that the German Government is about to decide to cease to use Sellafield as a reprocessing centre for German nuclear waste? Does the Government intend to put in place a co-ordinated campaign to advance the Irish objective of closing Sellafield?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in respect of the first matter. There will be an ongoing debate and I believe that attempts to make fundamental changes will be made at some future date. In my opinion, such attempts will be strongly opposed by the neutral states. Any pro<Col N="840" /> posed major changes to Ireland's sovereignty or neutrality would have to be put to the people.</P>

It is amazing that at some of the debates to which I referred people arrived in possession of the 1945 and 1954 Western European Union treaties. However, I admit these individuals are in a minority among the general population.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, I did not raise the issue of Sellafield with Chancellor Schröeder, but I have raised it on numerous occasions with Prime Minister Blair. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise has provided me with submissions on the different movements which have taken place in the ongoing discussions and I have discussed the subject with Prime Minister Blair in several formats in recent months. I will take a suitable opportunity to raise it with the German Chancellor in the near future.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, among other things, the lesson of the recent war in Kosovo is that given that Europe has no common defence of its own, it has to rely on the United States, and, in practice, that means that when it comes to deciding what should and should not be bombed it is not Europeans who make the decisions but American generals and air <Col N="841" /> force commanders? Will he also agree that important issues concerning life and death in European are not made by Europeans because the European Union has been unable, partly because of opposition from the Irish Government and others, to form its own defence policy and that, in effect, Europe has an American defence policy? Will the Taoiseach agree that for Europe, which is a self-respecting political unit that has its own common tax policy, social policy and immigration policy and its own policy on practically every other issue, not to have the means of being able to decide about its own defence is profoundly unsatisfactory and that Ireland should wish to resolve that dilemma rather than contribute to it?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of points. Under the Cologne declaration and all the many initiatives in this area in recent years, Ireland has played a role based on peacekeeping and we should continue to do that.  Deputy Bruton would be aware that it is only recently the United Kingdom and other countries have made any attempt to move to talk about this in a European domain. They absolutely and fundamentally bitterly opposed any reference to this because they thought that NATO could be affected and they did not want it to be run on any kind of European basis.</P>

      <P>We do not need the British to provide us with cover in these matters. They now realise they should consider this in a different light and NATO has also indicated that it is ready to define arrangements to give the EU access to its own resources for the Peterberg Tasks in regard to the implementation of the EU's common foreign and security policy. It will be for the EU to make its own decisions as to how it will deal with the Petersberg Tasks. Deputies may also be aware that NATO has already indicated its readiness to support peacekeeping missions under the authority of the UN and the OSCE. There are developments and movements. Having listened to meetings down through the years, particularly the meetings before and during the crisis in Kosovo, I do not get the impression that there is any great attempt by the Council of European Ministers to move to a situation where Europe would have all its own powers, play its own role and have its own army. They are not issues I hear about. There is a stronger view that, no matter how difficult, we should reform the UN and how it makes its decisions and try to ensure there is an understanding on UN resolutions <Col N="842" /> before taking action. As I said, that is extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>What is the Taoiseach's attitude to the Finnish declaration that its aim is to improve the Union's ability to take decisions on a range of external relations matters, including trade, common foreign security policy and defence, when it takes over the Presidency? Given that the Taoiseach referred to the need for reform of the United Nations, will he indicate what is the Government's programme for reform of the UN and is it intended to press that when Ireland takes its seat on the Security Council? Does the Taoiseach think it would be wise for the Government to publish a Green Paper on the evolving relationship between Ireland and the European Union? The institutions of the Union, the relationship of Ireland to it and our role in common foreign, security and defence policy are issues we will have to grasp. Does the Taoiseach think it would be wise for us to initiate that debate through the publication of a Green Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not made a decision on a Green Paper but there is a number of evolving issues as we prepare for the next Intergovernmental Conference and the work of next year. It is hoped to make some progress on a number of these issues, which were first raised by Germany at the Council meeting in Vienna and then at Cologne, by December 2000 when France takes over the Presidency. In the next 18 months a great deal <Col N="843" /> of work will have to be done on these issues and we will have to see what is the best way of putting them forward. I would not rule out a Green Paper on those issues.</P>
      <P>Finland has outlined a number of initiatives of which we want to be supportive. Its agenda is a good one. It is anxious to have our support and I have conveyed our position to the Finnish Prime Minister. On UN reform and the Security Council, when I met with Kofi Annan here and subsequently in Brussels, he indicated the programme of reform which aims to simplify the structures, arrangements and decision-making process. We have used this in our campaign for membership. I have discussed this matter with a number of people, most recently with the Prime Minister of Canada who has been on the Council and has also been pushing this matter. He explained the insurmountable difficulties in reforming the UN structure.</P>
      <P>When Kofi Annan addressed the European Council last April he emphasised there would be movement on these issues and he seems to have the support of the European countries. Last March when I visited the United States the Secretary of State outlined what they were doing in this regard. It is supportive of these substantial reforms &ndash; I do not want to overstate what Ireland can do &ndash; which are clearly necessary. The logjams and difficulties which are created make it almost impossible for the Secretary General to adequately run an efficient organisation. He is determined and has set deadlines for the achievement of reform. We will be supportive of that if we are elected to the Security Council.</P>

The structure was similar but there was a belief that Mr. Milosevic and his <Col N="844" /> administration were not serious and would continue to frustrate efforts to reach an agreement, which is why the talks broke down in relation to seven or eight different areas. The benefits of the current agreement were clear. It included a military structure and there was a short timescale. There is now a peacekeeping force in the region for the longer term.

      <P>My Department's work in examining the books and documents of six companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, is substantially completed, and a number of reports are now being prepared by the authorised officer. I expect to receive final reports on many of these investigations over the summer period. The companies involved are Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Celtic Helicopters Limited, Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. The time being taken to complete these reports is due primarily to the volume of documentation involved and the need to obtain legal advice on a number of issues.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have appointed an authorised officer to a further three companies. In the cases of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited, I am awaiting the outcome of High Court judicial review proceedings of my decision. In relation to College Trustees Limited, I hope the officer will be given the books and documents that he has specified in the near future. It is not possible to speculate now on when these three reports might be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four completed reports have already been referred by me to the DPP, and while my Department is available to assist in clarifying any matters in relation to these reports, I do not have any information on what decisions, if any, the DPP <Col N="845" /> has made. The reports in question relate to Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd, Garuda Ltd and Faxhill Homes Ltd.</P>
    <P>While the inquiries into National Irish Bank Ltd and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd were initiated at my request under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, they are proceeding under the auspices of the High Court. While the inspectors appointed by the court have filed a number of interim reports since their appointment, I expect that it will be some time yet before they will be ready to submit their final report to the High Court. The delay in these cases has been substantially due to the problems caused for the inspectors' work by a number of legal difficulties which have now been resolved by decisions of the High Court.</P>

Her reply to a question I tabled on 12 May is almost word for word the same as her reply today, six weeks later. She said on 12 May that she understood that, in the case of Bula and National Irish Bank Financial Services, the DPP had referred the matters to the Garda Síochána for investigation. Can she give any indication of how advanced the Garda investigation is? Are the Garda about to make any charges or bring anyone to court?</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions I have expressed my frustration with the length of time these inquiries are taking. However, as the Deputy knows, the volume of documentation and the number of people involved in these investigations is as great and greater, in some cases, than the number being investigated by two tribunals of inquiry. We know how long it has taken those tribunals to reach their current position. There were several legal challenges to the appointment of these officers. The officers in question have been working full-time on these inquiries for a considerable length of time.</P>
      <P>From my point of view the inquiries are virtually completed and the authorised officer is currently drafting his final report for submission to me. When I get that report I will decide what should happen next.</P>
      <P>The DPP is an independent office holder. Therefore, he does not report to me or anyone else on what he has done in relation to the reports which have been referred to him.</P>
      <P>As I told the Deputy previously, the Bula Resources (Holdings) plc and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd reports have been referred to the Garda Síochána. It is not a matter for me to inquire of the Garda Síochána what progress it has made. I assume the Deputy, as a former Minister for Justice, knows that would not be appropriate. There are also actions open to the Minister in relation to many of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will find that, when the final <Col N="846" /> reports emerge over the summer period, decisions will be taken to advance these cases further. Due to the number of people involved, the number of legal representations made, the number of challenges to the appointment of these officers and the volume of documentation to be examined &ndash; dating back in some cases over 20 years &ndash; these inquiries are taking a considerable length of time. However, I am more than happy with the progress that has been made and with the diligent manner in which the officers in question have carried out these inquiries.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste have any intention of making public any of the reports or findings she has, given her comments over recent months about how shocked, appalled and amazed she has been by the extent of the golden circle?

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am precluded under section 21 of the Companies Act from submitting the documentation to anybody. However, I said in the House before that the documentation sent to me was also sent to the two tribunals of inquiry. Much of the documentation they have brought into the public domain was also in the possession of my officers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the next stage, it is open to me when I receive the final reports, which I expect to do over the summer period, to seek the appointment by the High Court of an inspector under section 8, which would be a public inquiry for the purpose of what the Deputy is inquiring about. The findings may warrant my doing that. I will have an open mind about that until I see the recommendations in the final reports which are currently being drafted by the officer.</P>

      <P>Job initiative participants have access to three years temporary employment. The 1999 budget added an additional 875 places to job initiative provision, bringing the total number of places available to 2,875.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned Deloitte &amp; Touche to undertake a review of the programme and this is well under way. Its report is expected in July. In parallel, my Department has consulted job initiative stakeholders and this process, too, will help inform future policy.</P>

Is she aware, despite her opening remark that these people are employed on schemes for three years, people have been told they will be disemployed after much less than three years and, in some cases, after two years? Is she aware FÁS told the participants in her constituency that the first 1,000 would be disemployed from November and that they would receive redundancy payments? Will she comment on that?</P>

      <P>We have not fully filled the complement of 2,875 places &ndash; the last budget added 875 places but they have not all been taken up yet. As the Deputy is aware, when this initiative was first introduced it was done with a view to giving three years involvement in a programme of this kind to those who have been unemployed for more than five years. They were not intended to be full-time public sector jobs.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I said to the Deputy on a previous occasion in this House that I want to adopt a flexible approach. People cannot stay on the programme forever because that would mean others could not have access to it. We cannot make it a permanent feature. However, we need some degree of flexibility in some cases, in terms both of individuals and the nature of the work being undertaken. I hope that when I receive the evaluation in July, in advance of when decisions have to be made in the autumn, we will be in a position to introduce that element of flexibility.</P>

I wish to ask her again if she knows that persons in her own constituency who are participating in the job initiative scheme have been told they will be let go after less than three years participation and, in some cases, after as little as two years participation. Am I interpreting her remarks correctly when I say the scheme itself will continue?</P>
      <P>Is she aware, in regard to all the places not being taken up, that people are being offered contracts for only the duration of the scheme? In other words, where someone had served on the scheme for two and a half years, for example, someone else is being offered that job for only the remaining six months. Does she accept that offering someone a job for six months rather than three years is an entirely different proposal to what was intended under the scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Deputy is suggesting. That is not the intention. I envisage a continuing role for the job initiative programme. However, as the Deputy knows, we also have proposals for the social economy and community employment schemes. I am keen that everything should be reasonably well integrated so that there will be clarity as to what each programme is intended for. Many are targeted at the same people. What is important is not what the programmes are called but the useful work they do and the useful experience they give to people who have been long-term unemployed. We are virtually down to the core level of unemployment in our society. It is probably under 6 per cent taking into account the latest quarterly survey which was published recently. If that is factored into the way <Col N="849" /> the live register is calculated, unemployment has probably gone below 6 per cent. We hope to reach a target of 5 per cent by the end of next year. We are now dealing with the very hard cases and we need imaginative responses to those cases if we are to access opportunities for them. It is not intended that this programme should end. It is intended that whatever reform takes place, it should be subject to some degree of flexibility both in terms of the programmes themselves and the individuals who participate in them. As soon as I conclude my deliberations on the evaluation, which will be while the Dáil is in recess, I will revert to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said that the programme will continue. Do I also take it that she is expressing disapproval of the practice of offering people six or nine months' participation, as is happening currently? Does she acknowledge the difference between those participating in the social economy and those participating in useful community work? For example, how does she purport to deal with the situation where a small number of workers have been involved in, say, a co-operative project and have really put in the hours above and beyond the call of duty to try to make that co-operative viable? Can it be proposed that, having the prospect of turning the corner after three years, those people will be disemployed? Does she accept it would be entirely impractical to say that the 15 current workers would be out and 15 new ones brought in to do the jobs the previous workers built up?</P>

      <Quest>when the Government will establish a competitiveness review mechanism to deal with costs, competition, reparation and economic infrastructures.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council was established in May 1997, thereby implementing one of the Government's commitments entered into in Partnership 2000. It comprises 11 member representatives of the social partners and reports to the Taoiseach on the main challenges facing the enterprise economy. It <Col N="850" /> makes recommendations on how to improve Ireland's competitiveness, in particular in relation to items such as costs, competition policy and infrastructure, as mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The council's 1999 work plan concentrates on seven critical issues for public policy that are expected to make a major contribution to Ireland's medium-term competitiveness performance as follows: social cohesion, people, costs, infrastructure, e-commerce, competition and regulation, science and technology. The main output of the council during the first half of 1999 was the publication of the Annual Competitiveness Report 1999, a comprehensive and authoritative statistical assessment of the State's international competitiveness. A report on costs, to be published shortly, will identify the main cost factors for Irish industry and compare them with levels in key competitor countries, in particular the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be done to monitor the policies and actions that impact on the competitiveness of the enterprise sector? How will the recommendations be brought into the public domain to improve job creation, particularly in the west where there is a huge imbalance in respect of infrastructure? E-commerce will add to competition costs, particularly in the retail sector. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on this because of its serious implications for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports of the National Competitiveness Council are published. The most recent one, published on 5 May, dealt with issues such as skills, costs, the information society and telecommunications. Competitiveness is something we must constantly keep our eye on because it is never ending. The fact that a firm is competitive one day does not mean that in six months' time it will still be competitive. Clearly there are a number of key issues which include skills and availability of people. That is why the Government made £365 million available over the past two years to try to ramp up the number of people qualifying in key sectors of the economy where we were experiencing difficulties.</P>
      <P>Another area is the whole issue of regulation. It is generally accepted that economies that are overregulated are anti-competitive, so we need effective regulation and it must be enforced, but we do not need over-regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are issues to do with taxation and the cost of labour. That impacts on budgetary policy. It has a key role to play in maintaining our competitiveness. The issue the Deputy has highlighted &ndash; infrastructure &ndash; is crucial to the capacity to make Ireland a hub for electronic commerce, and that in the main depends on developing the infrastructure and the regulatory and legal framework and having people with skills. Electronic commerce is a huge new growing area of business that we want to identify, and one that could help us maintain our competitiveness if we tap the potential it has for Ireland. At the moment the Americans have 80 per cent <Col N="851" /> of the e-commerce market. It is estimated that it will be worth one trillion dollars annually by 2005. The Europeans have about 10 per cent of that market. We want Ireland to be the e-commerce hub of Europe, and the Government has put together a public-private partnership to develop that infrastructure and to bring in the players that can provide connectivity to the main centres in the world and, it is hoped, the main centres throughout the country to allow us to capture e-commerce projects.</P>
    <P>In relation to competitiveness, we need to keep our eye constantly on the ball. There are some people who have suggested that, just as we gender-proof Government policies, we should competitiveness-proof them. That is something to which we should give consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on a report of last week that the bulk of the jobs created in future years will be created on the east coast? That was a very disturbing statement. It is very worrying for the Border counties and the north-west because so few jobs have been created there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the Border counties, the west, excluding Galway, and the midlands have not done as well as other parts of the country in relation to inward investment and that is largely because of the lack of appropriate infrastructure. The violence in Northern Ireland did not make the Border counties very attractive. The IDA, which is opening a new office in Cavan, has indicated that it will double the number of new jobs in those regions. The policy at the moment is to go for a larger number of small projects rather than a small number of larger projects. The emphasis is not on huge job numbers but rather on trying to get more projects which are suitable for the smaller provincial towns. That remains the policy. Some 72 per cent of new IDA jobs announced since this Government took office have been for outside the Dublin area, by which I mean outside the area from Drogheda to Bray and across to Kildare town. I accept that it still is the case that many of the expansions are in Dublin because many of the existing facilities are in Dublin. Certainly there has been a very big emphasis on trying to get projects into other areas and the big issue here is infrastructure. If we have appropriate infrastructure, we will attract investment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Following discussion with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform a number of changes have been introduced to the arrangements governing work permits. Essentially, a number of categories of non-EU nationals who previously required work permits in order to take up employment in the State will no longer require such permits. These arrangements will be kept under review to ensure that they are effective and do not give rise to abuses.</P>
      <P>As and from 6 April 1999 persons who have been given permission to remain in the State because they are married to Irish nationals will no longer be required to be covered by work permits in order to take up employment in the State. Similarly, such persons may now also engage in business or in a profession without seeking the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>It must be emphasised that the position outlined above applies only to persons who have been given leave to remain under the aliens legislation. The mere fact that a person is married to an Irish citizen or has an Irish child is not enough and a person in this position should not work even if a work permit has issued but should first seek the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State.</P>
      <P>With regard to extending the right to work to other non-EU-EEA citizens, I have recently submitted proposals to Government which, if agreed, would allow work permits to be issued in respect of certain categories of asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="853" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension in the categories of people who can work in Ireland without a work permit. It is a step forward. Where stands the Minister's proposal to extend work permits to other categories of non-EU citizens? Has she resolved her differences with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? </P>
      <P>What is the position for persons sent to Ireland for training or on intra-company transfers? Are any countries on a blacklist? There was once a list of residents from various countries who were not allowed into Ireland. Is the whole world allowed in on an intra-company exchange for less than four years or for training? Does the change in provisions for those sent to Ireland for training cover those sent here to attend Irish language schools who may be here for three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware if there are any countries on a blacklist for intra-company transfers for a four year period. That also applies to training, although Deputy Owen would know more than me about the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will check the position for language schools. As I understand it, the provisions exist for training within a company as part of the wider company experience, but I will check that. The Deputy is referring to one language school, which has been in touch with me recently about difficulties it is experiencing.</P>
      <P>The proposals I brought to Cabinet are still on its agenda. I hope they will be resolved before the summer recess. They have been on the agenda for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, this side of the House wishes the Tánaiste well in her struggle at Cabinet. This is an Irish solution to an Irish problem. We must now wait for non-EU nationals to intermarry with the natives before they can support themselves and their families. It is absurd that we insist on the State paying for those people when they are ready and willing to support themselves. Does the Tánaiste know the numbers who are likely to become eligible to work as a result of this step? I agree with Deputy Owen in that we welcome this move, but I would like to know its extent before I would call it even a modest step forward. The Tánaiste said it is not enough to be married and have a child to an Irish national, an application must also be made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Nelson Mandela would not get a visa into this State from this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Tánaiste knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absurd to say to those seeking asylum in this jurisdiction that we will pay them welfare but not give them the right to work to earn their own living. I have a fundamental objection to that and that is why there are alternative proposals before the Government. The public debate which has taken place on this issue has been helpful. We have to open our minds to people from other cultures. They can bring to <Col N="854" /> bear on society positive influences in a host of ways apart from the humanitarian issues involved. Most of these people come from cultures where they are not accustomed to getting a cheque in the post. They are accustomed to working for their living.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many will be covered as a result of the category of persons who marry and get permission to work from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I have not married an Irish citizen and have not borne a child in Ireland. I suspect not many people will be affected. We must have a wider policy with a more humanitarian approach, which would make economic sense. It is a fact that economies such as ours attract people for economic as well as humanitarian reasons. Some of them are working in the black economy and it is not good to encourage that. The law as it stands does, however, encourage it. There are also labour shortages in many sectors, and many employers would be delighted to offer employment to asylum seekers. There is a host of reasons this matter should be addressed in a satisfactory manner before the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has just completed a round of consultations with the social partners on the restructuring of community employment. Taking these discussions into account, I am now finalising my proposals for the restructuring of CE. As is standard practice, these proposals will be circulated to relevant Government Departments for observation prior to my bringing them to Government. I do not, however, intend to propose any changes in the eligibility criteria for community and voluntary bodies or schools.</P>
      <P>This year there has been a reduction in the number of places in community employment, from a level approaching 40,000 at end-1998 to an average of 37,500 in 1999. The reduction is indicative of a strategic shift in supports for unemployed persons away from community employment towards mainstream training programmes, bridging programmes to mainstream training, and job clubs. An additional 10,000 places in these areas were provided for in the 1999 Revised Estimates.</P>
      <P>FÁS has operational responsibility for project selection and appraisal. Priority is accorded to sponsors who provide good and relevant work experience, training and educational experiences, achieved good progression including placement results and have an approved and effective supervisor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to stress that a number of CE projects have a finite lifetime as opposed to those schemes that provide services which are rolled <Col N="856" /> over and this, too, will be a criterion applied in any reduction in numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware of the severe difficulties being experienced by many groups which are currently offering aid because they have CE schemes in place? Would the Tánaiste consider reviewing the situation whereby there must be a 65 per cent turnover in the people carrying out the CE schemes at the end of each year? They then have to end the scheme because there is not an appropriately qualified person available, when the person finishing the year could continue for another year. Will the Tánaiste display more flexibility in her approach to this scheme and instruct FÁS to desist from stopping projects from going ahead because of cuts in the CE schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are fewer people in community employment now than a year ago. Last year there were many more involved in it than in previous years. At a time when employment has fallen to 6 per cent, we cannot continue with community employment at the same level as when unemployment was substantially higher. The purpose of community employment, in the main, is to give unemployed people work experience and to help them back into the world of work and into a full job in the labour market. We have diverted some of the resources from community employment to more mainstream training, as recommended by the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, particularly for young people, which seems to be more effective in helping people to access jobs.</P>
      <P>A feature of community employment is that schemes end all the time. The Minister cannot make decisions on particular schemes. One must lay down criteria and expect FÁS to operate them in the most effective way possible. In addition to the worthwhile experience for the individuals involved, community employment fills a very useful role in the community, particularly in schools and in many voluntary bodies. That is why I said that, notwithstanding the recommendations of Deloitte &amp; Touche, we will not change the criteria for community and voluntary bodies or for schools. It will remain a feature of activity in that area. It is a question of priorities and choices and given the current economic progress, we are, thankfully, in a position to offer people more jobs than was the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that where community employment provides an essential service &ndash; for example, protecting school property &ndash;  it requires a different solution than the type of scheme she said has a finite lifetime? Is there any sign of Government allowing the Department of Education and Science, in respect of school caretakers and classroom assistants, to take on that responsibility? Does she accept that damage would be done to many schools if they were to lose these people? All Members of this <Col N="857" /> House have received representations to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the number in particular schools &ndash; that changes from time to time, as has always been the case &ndash; there is no question of community employment being withdrawn from schools, which was one of the recommendations of Deloitte &amp; Touche. It made the valid point that while very worthwhile work is done, it should be done on a full-time basis by full-time staff. Community employment serves a useful role in giving people experience of and involvement in the school. It is also much less expensive than creating full-time posts. I do not anticipate in the short-term that the Department of Education and Science will employ full-time assistants or caretakers.</P>
      <P>Again, it is a question of choices and priorities. Obviously, people will not remain in the same school. I cannot give that guarantee. The only guarantee I can give is that schools will remain among the bodies which will qualify for community employment. It is a matter for FÁS to look at the options in relation to the people and projects. In particular, I am anxious that schools in disadvantaged areas have priority and that they maintain the levels they require because they have greater needs from a security point of view and in terms of assistance to teachers and caretaking. In regard to community employment generally &ndash; I already spoke to FÁS about this &ndash; the priority must be the most disadvantaged communities, both urban and rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the decrease in unemployment which has led to a reduction in the number of community employment schemes. I take this opportunity to compliment the work being done in the community by those on community employment schemes. What does the Minister think about the role of FÁS in schools, particularly in the case of classroom assistants who have only a limited amount of time on the scheme? Children, particularly those with a disability, are only getting used to their helper when they fall out of the scheme as they no longer fulfil the criteria set out by FÁS. The Minister is not going to change the criteria and that creates many difficulties for Deputies.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the progression to full-time employment, especially in rural areas? There was a time when one could not get people onto community employment schemes but now one cannot get them off them until they are told they must leave. Will the remaining FÁS places be allocated to unemployment blackspots, such as my area which has had a rough time over recent months and which would qualify under the perceived unemployment levels criteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes. The difficulties the Deputy highlighted are an operational matter. Clearly, it would be desirable that if children are <Col N="858" /> getting assistance from classroom assistants under community employment, they would have it for the full academic year and there would not be a change in personnel. That may be easier said than done in terms of how one organises that, but it would be desirable from the point of view of the school and the student.</P>
      <P>On progression to full-time employment, community employment satisfies the needs of many because of the 19 hours per week requirement. Perhaps there is a reluctance to move away from community employment. People get great satisfaction working in the voluntary and school sectors, and that is an aspect which encourages people to continue to participate. Sometimes one must be cruel to be kind in that there are others waiting to get into community employment schemes. If we continue to keep the same people in community employment, others will not have the same experience.</P>
      <P>Malin Head and the surrounding area is very disadvantaged in terms of employment, particularly in light of the Fruit of the Loom decision. I hope that is one of the areas where community employment will continue to fulfil an important role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Who sets the quota for each county in terms of the number of vacancies FÁS can promote? Often the level of new starts depends on the number of participants on the scheme at a given time. Deputy Rabbitte made the point about the importance of different categories for employment under community employment schemes. Deputy Keaveney correctly said that those receiving assistance in schools need continuity. In Sligo the number of schemes due to commence is very much dependent on the number taking part in the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government sets the budget and decides on the number who can participate in any one year. FÁS is expected to distribute the places on a fair and equitable basis in so far as that is possible and taking into account the needs of disadvantaged communities in particular because that is the priority. The numbers allocated to a particular region depends on a number of factors, including availability of a supervisor, the nature of the programmes offered, the prospect of progression into full-time employment and so on. It is a matter at regional level for FÁS to assess the various projects and to make choices.</P>
      <P>There are always more projects than available funding so FÁS must make choices based on the information at its disposal. That is an operational matter which cannot be done centrally. It is a mammoth task to organise 37,500 people annually in addition to the number of trainees. There are 18,000 apprentices and a larger number of others involved in various training programmes. Even at an organisational level, FÁS must handle a large number of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have clarity as regards the direction of the Government on the future of community employment because there is much uncertainty at the moment? Does the Minister consider that the training component of community employment is valuable generally across the schemes or does she agree it varies widely? Does she also agree that the training element in some cases is minimal and as a result it is difficult to expect people to acquire skills over 12 months which they did not acquire over 12 years in education and that they should be automatically expected to move into the labour market proper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the training element varies considerably from scheme to scheme rather than from area to area. It is dependent on a number of factors. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended a greater training element rather than community employment which it felt did not involve sufficient training, particularly for young people. It recommended more mainstream training in the case of young people. This year we have increased the training allowance to end the discrepancy between what one gets on community employment and on training. There was a large gap of almost £25. That now goes to encourage people into training. A number of problems have arisen, and clearly there is a high level of illiteracy. We are now trying to encourage that of the 19 hours, perhaps up to nine hours would be made available for people to return to education or to certified or recommended literacy programmes run in conjunction with the National Adult Literacy Association. This was one of the requests made at a seminar organised by the INOU which I recently attended. It is a sensible suggestion as many of the participants in community employment schemes do not have the skills necessary to access work and a significant education component in such cases is necessary.</P>
      <P>A decision will be made by the Government on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report before the summer. The memorandum to that effect will be circulated shortly to Departments for their observations. It is important that before the next session people know exactly the situation in relation to community employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a decision been made to cut 2,000 community employment places? Has the Minister considered changing the criteria to enable women and men who formerly worked in the home to enter the workplace through community employment schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a reduction of 2,000 based on the funding in the 1999 Estimates. However, additional funding was provided for 10,000 other labour market places, jobs clubs and training places. Therefore, an additional number of places is being provided, albeit in a different area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> I have given some consideration to widening the criteria to cover other categories of people. Today I referred to the criteria for groups which qualify for community employment schemes, including voluntary community bodies and schools. I also want to give consideration to changing the criteria for people who qualify for such schemes and to open opportunities for people who might want to return to the workplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's commitment to the future of community employment schemes for schools, what is her view on the appalling situation regarding community centres? She is no doubt aware that the community employment component has been run down in her own constituency in recent times, something which is of major concern. What other recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report does the Tánaiste not support? Does she agree there was a fair degree of criticism of the report concerning the amount of evaluation undertaken with the participants? Will she ensure the evaluation for the jobs initiative scheme is of a high standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that as many as possible of the stakeholders in the jobs initiative scheme are contacted before the evaluation is produced. This is important as in different places people have different experiences and people can be of different age groups. For example, some people might only be five years out of employment while others could be longer. It is important that we have the widest possible consultation in drawing up the evaluation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties in relation to community centres. As I said earlier, there are 37,500 people around the country working on community employment schemes. Even if this figure were doubled, some people would still demand a community employment project. Clearly, the line must be drawn somewhere. There have never been more people on community employment schemes and unemployment has never been so low. Deputies constantly raise with me the difficulties employers experience in finding workers. Therefore, there must be a balance in the sector. In particular, we must continue to focus on helping unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to return to the world of work. Deputy Rabbitte asked earlier about the social economy. Community employment schemes include a mix of activities which cannot be commercial. Schemes can be categorised by people and activity. There are people who will probably never get a job in the so-called real economy but who can do very worthwhile work in the social economy. I hope the model we bring forward will be a mix of the two, namely, supporting worthwhile activity and encouraging the employment of people who might otherwise not be able to access employment.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree it will never be possible for community centres to provide full-time jobs for people to carry out the work done by community employment schemes? At the very least will she examine how the scheme in relation to community centres is operating? Will she provide flexibility so that where there is no person available to replace a person on a scheme, particularly in rural areas, the person already on the scheme can remain to keep community centres open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>Flexibility must be the key where there is no one else to take up a position on a scheme. Nobody wants things to change suddenly. However, I do not want to say that everything will remain the same in all cases, as this will not happen. At regional level, FÁS will have to make the necessary choices.</P>
      <P>Regarding community centres, in the past we tended to build a physical structure and forget about how we would run it. The new proposals announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, for the disadvantaged areas in the context of the drugs taskforces is providing not only funding for new facilities but also funding for personnel. Both must go hand in hand. We must bear in mind who will run the worthwhile facilities we are building in communities many years down the road, when the initiators get tired or move on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, line 12, after &ldquo;Heritage&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the Minister shall cause to be included in that inventory every structure and building, <Col N="868" /> together with their settings and attendant grounds, fixtures and fittings, group of such structures and buildings, and site, which is in his or her opinion of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage. The word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; is added here arising out of an amendment tabled by the Minister on Committee Stage. We debated this issue on Committee Stage but I still feel that section 2(2) does not impose an obligation on the Minister to add particular structures to the inventory. I made the point previously that we must consider the legislation as it is framed, not in the context of the Minister's own intentions.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that local authorities will have a pivotal role in the development of the list of buildings or settings to be included in the inventory. However, if the Department is of the view that a particular structure should be added to the list but the local authority concerned is not amenable to that, for whatever reason, it is important that the Minister should be obliged to add the structure. The Minister should not stand idly by and fail to intervene in a situation in which a local authority was clearly pursuing a mistaken course of action in regard to the listing of a particular structure.</P>

      <P>The establishment and maintenance of the national inventory of architectural heritage, provided for in section 2, is governed by the definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; in section 1 which is the interpretation section. The Deputy will note that the definition includes the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; in the first line thus ensuring that if a structure meets the criteria set out in the definition, it will be regarded as part of architectural heritage. The purpose of the inventory is precisely to record and include in the inventory all aspects of our architectural heritage, as defined in section 1. Therefore, I do not consider the amendment to be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I again draw the Minister's attention to section 2(2) which states that &ldquo;the Minister may do any or all of the following&rdquo;. I put it to the Minister that that does not impose any particular obligation on her. Who will be the arbiter of whether structures, groups of structures or sites should be included in the inventory? I understood from Committee Stage that the Minister was of the view that lists would issue from local authorities and that she did not see herself as having any particular role in adding to the lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2, as it stands, places an obligation on the Minister. The Deputy will note the words &ldquo;shall cause to be established&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is very strong and would cover the anxieties being expressed by the Deputy. The inclusion of the Deputy's amendment would be repetitive and superfluous. The issue about which <Col N="869" /> the Deputy is concerned is already covered by section 2.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Shea's comments. Will the Minister define &ldquo;attendant grounds&rdquo;? Given the manner in which development is leading planning throughout the country, we are witnessing a huge explosion in investment and an invasion into what formerly constituted the attendant grounds of architectural and historic buildings. If one considers a 200 year old house surrounded by an avenue and trees, what constitutes its &ldquo;attendant grounds&rdquo; as defined in section 1?</P>

      <P>I refer to section 2(1) which states that &ldquo;the Minister shall cause to be established and maintained an inventory to be known as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage&rdquo;. The Minister referred to the definition of architectural heritage. Any such definition or interpretation is subject to arbitration and it is not clear to me who will decide what &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; means. There are many structures, buildings and sites which it is clear are part of our architectural heritage. What I am talking about are those about which there is a dispute in spite of the expertise available to local authorities in drawing up their lists to be included in the national inventory. The Minister should be obliged to act on the advice available to her Department and make additions. It is not clear, however, whether the local authorities or the Minister will make the final decision in the event of disagreement.</P>

I understand the Deputy has received a copy of the report from the clerk to the committee. If he has a difficulty, he should take the matter up with the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>On the definition of &ldquo;attendant grounds&rdquo;, the Bill incorporates the definition of &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; set out in the Granada Convention which includes the setting in which a building is found. This extends to the avenue and surrounding grounds, whether it be parkland or gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the national inventory of architectural heritage, it is the Minister who will decide on what buildings are of local, regional or national import<Col N="870" /> ance. Any building which meets the definition will be included. The amendment, therefore, is superfluous. Section 2 outlines the obligations of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that initially the intention was that the national inventory of architectural heritage would be completed within 40 years but she sought to have this reduced to 12 years. I support the Bill, which is a good one. Valuable work will be completed under it. I would not like to see it pass through the House, however, without some target being set. The Bill reads: &ldquo;The Minister shall cause to be established and maintained an inventory to be known as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage.&rdquo;  If no target is set, it may take 40 years to complete the inventory. With the expertise and professional and voluntary assistance available to the Department, it should be possible to complete it within ten years. This should be set down in the Bill. Approximately one million buildings have to be listed and examined, many of which will be included in the local authorities' inventories.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward amendment, the purpose of which is to ensure the Bill will not be open-ended, with no end in sight, given that the Minister's successors may not be as successful in obtaining funds from the Minister for Finance. It is necessary, therefore, to set a target for completion of the inventory. The person in charge of the appropriate section would then be able to say to staff, &ldquo;It is our job to complete the national inventory of architectural heritage by 2009. Let us see if we can meet this target.&rdquo;  He or she should not have to say, &ldquo;You are joining this outfit at the age of 20. When you are 65 the national inventory of architectural heritage will still not have been completed.&rdquo;  Ten years is sufficient time to complete it.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment as I am a great believer in deadlines. There should be a statutory obligation on the Department to complete the inventory, be it in ten or 40 years. It was indicated on Second Stage that the Minister would have the support of this side of the House in her quest to obtain additional funds to have it completed. This will strengthen the hand of the Department. The necessary resources will have to be provided and the work will be completed if there is a statutory obligation on the Government to finish the work within ten years. If this issue is left open-ended the work could be put on the long finger by a future Government which is not committed to our heritage or a Minister who is not as committed as the present Minister to finishing this work. Ten years is a reasonable period <Col N="871" /> of time for the completion of this work. The Minister and the country will win if this amendment is accepted. I do not like open-ended timeframes as they inevitably lead to work being left incomplete.</P>

      <P>As I noted on Committee Stage, it has proved possible to shorten the timescale for the completion of the inventory to 12 years. We had a long discussion during which different timescales such as 40 years, 25 years and 12 years were discussed. I reiterate the commitment I gave on Committee Stage that I will make every effort to shorten the timescale. I am also advised that this process has taken far longer in other countries than the period we envisage. In view of the urgency attached to conserving our architectural heritage, I have requested that a preliminary county-wide survey be completed and made available to local authorities within three years. I made this point so that people would not think that the only work being undertaken is in the context of the NIAH.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I also undertook to examine the possibility of including a mechanism in the Bill to allow for reviews of the progress being achieved with regard to the inventory. Opposition Deputies have not tabled an amendment in this regard. However, having considered the matter, it appears that the only practical way to provide for such a review mechanism is to include an obligation in the Bill requiring the submission of a progress report to the Oireachtas at specified intervals. However, such a provision would be superfluous in light of my recent decision to initiate preparation of an annual report from the Department as a whole with effect from this year. I propose that these annual reports will be laid in the Oireachtas Library. I am happy to give the House an undertaking that each report will contain a progress report on the national inventory of architectural heritage for the year in question.</P>
      <P>I regret that I cannot accept this amendment. Deputy Kenny stated that we are all concerned that this work should be completed as quickly as possible. I will ensure that staffing resources will be available to considerably reduce the timescale. We are talking about 12 years and I hope we will be able to complete the work within a 12 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the support of Members for the provision of more resources for the work of the NIAH. On Committee Stage Opposition <Col N="872" /> Members kindly stated that they would support me in seeking additional resources to push this agenda forward. However, it would not be appropriate to provide for a fixed timescale for the completion of the inventory in this legislation. I have given a commitment concerning the staffing and resources we are attempting to make available to reduce the timescale so that we can ensure that people will be able to closely monitor the steady progress in the annual reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is like mathematics in that one can have steady progress towards an end without ever reaching it. I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the information regarding the select committee reports. I was not aware that these reports were available on the computer system. I have received a hard copy of the report with which I am familiar.</P>
      <P>In the report the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I accept that 12 years is a long time and I would much prefer to be in a position to shorten that time. I am willing to make every effort to reduce that timescale even further.</P>
      <P>The Minister then advised that this process takes longer in other countries. I want to help the Minister. She and future Ministers and the NIAH would be in a stronger position to acquire the necessary staff if they were able to point out in the annual reports that a ten year target is set out in law for the completion of this work. The Minister stated that she hoped the work would be completed well within 12 years. If that is the case, it should be feasible to stipulate a ten year period for the completion of the inventory.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera is the Minister who is providing the resources for the work. She issues a direction as to the kind of inventory she wants produced and its contents. As the political head of the Department and the person who issues political policy to the NIAH, surely it is normal for the Minister to outline its remit, responsibilities, resources and target, and to state that she wants the work completed within ten years. This would ensure that those dealing with these matters in ten years would have a full, accurate, up-to-date inventory available. It would also ensure that local authority planners producing county development plans, businesses expanding and locating throughout the country and every aspect of Irish development would fully appreciate that this legislation set out a ten year timeframe which would be adhered to. I will press this amendment as it will help the Minister to extract the necessary resources and assistance from the Department of Finance to enable her staff and the NIAH to complete this work within ten years.</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage debate on the timescale was interesting in that Deputy Kenny referred to trying to complete the work within five years. He now realises that this could take ten to 12 years, which seems the most <Col N="873" /> realistic timeframe. There is no problem in talking about targets and timescales. The completion of the county-wide survey so that it is available to local authorities within three years is an important target and timescale. There is also the issue of working towards the 12 years. I would like to see the work completed within 12 years. It <Col N="874" /> is important that we set targets and do our best to achieve them. However, it is not appropriate to set a timeframe in the legislation. That is why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>5.&ndash;Section 2 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, (as amended by section 11 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987) is hereby amended in the definition of &ldquo;monument&rdquo; by the deletion of the words from &ldquo;, but does not include&rdquo;to the end of the definition.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I seek this amendment to the Bill because structures considered to be religious are exempt from the National Monuments Acts. The amendment removes the blanket exemption. The Minister may say it is unconstitutional to make the amendment, but she did not say so on Committee Stage. Apart from the fact that the 1937 Constitution was not in place when the 1930 Act was passed, there is a provision in the Constitution, Article 44.2.6º, which states:</P>
      <P>The property of any religious denomination or any educational institution shall not be diverted save for necessary works of public utility and on payment of compensation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks to amend the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, so that monuments which are 100 years old will be included as against the situation at present where only monuments which are 299 years old or older are included. Many architecturally important structures can be defined as religious. Because of the importance of these structures in terms of our heritage and because of the important part they have played in our history, they should be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed us on Committee Stage that she is in the process of drafting a heritage plan and that she will examine these issues in that context. There is no guarantee there will be amendment to the National Monuments Acts. This means we are embarking on a process of compiling a national inventory of our important architectural heritage when certain important structures are excluded under another Act.</P>
      <P>I withdrew my amendment on Committee Stage but I am not satisfied with certain monuments of architectural merit being excluded, on the one hand, because they are part of our religious heritage and, on the other, because they are not old enough. I ask the Minister to respond more firmly than she did on Committee Stage because a large and significant discrepancy exists in respect of the buildings, sites, etc., which can be described as national monuments under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most interesting ways of understanding the history of an area and the people who lived there is to visit its churches and places of worship. Most, if not all, of the <Col N="876" /> graveyards throughout the country are associated with churches and are situated on ground which has been sanctified by one church or another. To prepare an inventory of our physical heritage which excludes churches is foolish. It would be equally foolish if the implication of this was that graveyards, which are associated with churches and which are part of the property of churches, would be excluded as a result of the exclusion of churches. I, therefore, support Deputy O'Shea's amendment, the aim of which is to ensure that churches are included under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am aware that arguments have been advanced that there is a separation between Church and State in our Constitution. I accept that this separation exists but it is not as rigid as it might be presented by some people. For example, the Church is intimately involved in education and that involvement has been supported by the taxpayer in a substantial way. It is impossible to conceive of political activity which is not inspired in some way by spiritual values. These values may or may not be of a transcendental origin but it is not possible to divide life into neat compartments, religious and non-religious. Life is not like that, life is a seamless garment. It is not feasible or wise for us to adopt a rigid view of the constitutional constraint which might prevent acceptance of Deputy O'Shea's amendment in the way it is intended. The amendment should be accepted.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Constitution which separates Church and State originated in a time which was very different to that in which we now live. The need which existed in the 1930s to separate Church and State came about because the Church was seen to be exercising an inordinate, sometimes authoritarian, influence over democratic political activity. That is not the case today. If anything, those involved in organised religion are afraid to express their views for fear that they might be refused the right to do so because those views come from a religious perspective. In many ways people involved in organised religion have lost their voices because of a prevailing orthodoxy that is, in itself, reactionary. The current preference for political correctness is reactionary in the sense that it is a reaction to an earlier unhealthy arrangement which has been put aside. However, the reaction has been equally unhealthy. Therefore, we should be constrained in the way the Minister believes we are.</P>
      <P>In many instances, churches and churchyards have a tremendous capacity to inform us about political history and about the status of particular families in different localities. The inscriptions people put on gravestones hint in an eloquent way at the relationships which existed in certain families. In some instances, for example, the term &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; may be expressed more prominently than in others. The expressions inscribed on some gravestones are literally &ldquo;cold&rdquo; while others are, at least metaphorically speaking, quite &ldquo;warm&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were to visit a cemetery with a copy of the electoral register in one's possession, one <Col N="877" /> could see which families had survived and which families did not. Graveyards are, in a sense, tangible history. Graveyards are alive in the imagination and there are fewer things I enjoy more when I have time, than to visit a graveyard. I look forward to visiting the grave of my great grandfather from Dublin in Glasnevin cemetery.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept Deputy O'Shea's good and thoughtful amendment which bridges the artificial divide that has been created for purposes which are now anachronistic. These artificial divisions are no longer necessary and I hope the Minister will have the courage of her convictions to ignore any cautious advice offered by the Attorney General and other less qualified persons and make a decision, as a legislator, to accept Deputy O'Shea's amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's intervention has broadened the debate on Deputy O'Shea's amendment and added a new dimension to it. I strongly support the amendment because churches and religious buildings are the focal points of many villages and towns. Most people accept that those which have stood for centuries &ndash; Ballintubber Abbey, Holy Cross or Cong Abbey &ndash;  are well maintained by the State.</P>
      <P>Travelling here today in my car I listened to comments on the radio about the village of Ardagh, County Longford, which won the national award, North and South, for villages of its type. I was repeatedly struck by the many comments about the church buildings and the old abbey in the locality.</P>
      <P>When former Deputy Nealon served as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, he dealt extensively with the confiscation and illegal export of gravestones and cornerstones from various abbeys throughout the country. I support Deputy O'Shea's comments about the provision in the Constitution and my party believes that church buildings and graveyards should be included in the national inventory. I urge the Minister to include them.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the concerns in respect of ecclesiastical buildings. However, this issue would be better considered in terms of the national heritage plan because we would be given an opportunity to look at the National Monuments Acts to see how best they can be improved to aid the conservation and preservation of our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised a specific issue and it is important to note that we are discussing the question of places of worship which are in current use. There would be implications if we included these churches in the definition of the term &ldquo;monu<Col N="878" /> ment&rdquo;. That is why we need to examine the National Monuments Acts to ascertain how they need to be amended. That would best be done under the National Heritage Plan, on which we have had a great deal of consultation.</P>

      <P>We have to consider these issues within the context of our heritage. It is not merely a question of making these changes in a piecemeal fashion. We must examine what is already in place under our laws. The National Monuments Acts have worked well, but I agree with the Deputy that we need to review issues concerning ecclesiastical buildings. It is best to do that within the context of the National Heritage Plan and I cannot, therefore, accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. All buildings are part of our heritage and no building should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill. Some convents and monasteries have beautiful small churches that are gems of architectural design which are not open to public view in a real sense. While the sensitivities of places of worship must be taken into account, the heritage we all inherit is part of a broad package and there is no reason any part of it should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>While I am disappointed with the Minister's response, I ask her, as I did on Committee Stage, to move quickly on this issue. If she reaches the decision, which I hope and suspect she will, that amendments to the National Monuments Acts are necessary, I ask her to introduce such amending legislation quickly because the national inventory will be incomplete if a broad section of religious buildings is excluded from the provisions of the Bill. I am disappointed about that, and I will press my amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a three section Bill to amend the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999 of 22 March 1999. It is a technical amendment to that Act, designed to ensure the change in the status of the follow-up programme to the current PEACE programme does not inhibit the Special EU Programmes Body carrying out the functions envisaged for it in the original legislation.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the Act made provision, <i>inter alia, </i>in relation to the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland establishing the North-South Implementation Bodies.  The annex to that Agreement sets out the function of each of the six implementation bodies to be established under the Agreement, while part 4 of Annex 1 sets out the functions of the Special EU Programmes Body and parts 4 and 7 of Annex 2 set out the arrangements to apply to the body. This body's functions, include, <i>inter alia,</i> functions that relate to both the current PEACE programme, which is a Community initiative, and to its successor, which is also categorised as a Community initiative in the Agreement and in the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Following the EU European Council in Berlin in March, it was decided, in the context of reducing the overall number of EU Community initiatives, that the PEACE programme would henceforth be categorised as mainstream Structural Funding. Legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and from the British-Northern Ireland legal advisers is that unless remedial action is taken, this could result in making the envisaged role of the Special EU Programmes Body in regard to the PEACE programme, post-1999, <i>ultra vires</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> To ensure legal certainty and as proof against possible legal challenge, the Irish and British Governments have agreed to effect a technical supplementary Agreement, which will represent an interpretative statement on the previous Agreement. This has been effected through the exchange of letters between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as detailed in the Schedule to the Bill now being presented &ndash; the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill, 1999. The Agreement is intended to be a subsequent Agreement regarding the interpretation of the treaty for the purposes of Article 31 (3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The supplementary Agreement will ensure that, despite the decision of the Berlin European Council that the successor to the PEACE programme will not be a Community initiative, the original intention of both Governments that the Special EU Programmes Body will cover the successor programme will be put into effect.</P>
    <P>It is considered legally appropriate to bring forward primary rather than secondary legislation, as the provision for making regulations in section 5 of the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, relates to facilitating implementation of the existing Agreement, and could not safely be used to give effect in domestic law to a new technical amending Agreement.</P>
    <P>In order that the Special EU Programmes Body can function concurrently with other implementation bodies as soon as the British-Irish Agreement comes into force, it is necessary to have the amending legislation enacted prior to that date. Parallel legislation is being enacted on the UK side.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly refer to the functions envisaged for the Special EU Programmes Body. The EU programmes involved in the present round of Structural Funding are the current Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme and the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. The programmes support a wide range of socio-economic activities in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. The programmes are jointly managed by the Department of Finance and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel. A range of functions carried out at present by the two Finance Departments, including the management and monitoring of the programmes, will be transferred to the body.</P>
    <P>The body will have significant functions in relation to post-1999 Structural Funding. It will advise the North-South Ministerial Council and the Finance Departments on the negotiation of the post-1999 Community initiatives. It will prepare for the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council detailed programme proposals under the new Community initiatives and the successor to PEACE and will be involved in the negotiations on the new programmes with the European Commission. It will also be responsible for grant-making and other managerial functions <Col N="881" /> in respect of INTERREG III, the cross-Border elements of other initiatives and the successor to the PEACE programme.</P>
    <P>The body will also be directly responsible for a new proactive approach to the support and encouragement of an ever increasing range of North-South co-operative actions along the lines set out in the common chapter of the respective national plans. The body will provide a unique focus point to ensure maximum complementarity and added value in the delivery of cross-Border programmes. It will facilitate the drafting of cross-Border EU initiatives in such a way that will ensure a coherent, cohesive, integrated and effective response to the problems and the challenges posed by the peace process. EU funding in respect of the successor to the PEACE programme is expected to be some 500 million euro, of which one hundred million euro would be in respect of the southern Border counties. In addition, Ireland's share in the next round of Community initiatives is expected to be 150 million euro.</P>
    <P>There are two elements in the current process to copperfasten the function of the Special EU Programmes Body in relation to the successor to the current PEACE programme. The first is the exchange of letters between the two Governments agreeing the interpretation of the Agreement. The text of these letters is included in a Schedule to the current Bill. Section 1 provides for a definition of the Principal Act as the British Irish Agreement Act, 1999. Section 2 (a) provides for the insertion of an additional definition in the Principal Act of the Supplementary Agreement, being the letters exchanged between the two Governments and included as a Schedule to the current Bill. Section 2(b) provides for an addition to section 23 of the Principal Act which ensures that the references to the functions of the special EU programmes body be construed in accordance with the Supplementary Agreement, that is, that they include the successor to the current peace programme. Section 3 gives the short Title and collective citation, and provides for commencement.</P>
    <P>This proposed legislative amendment would ensure legal certainty in the new round of Structural Funds to guard against legal challenge, and along with the corresponding British statutory provision, would underpin the technical Supplementary Agreement. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will use this occasion to say a few words as we enter the final days of negotiation up to 30 June. Time is running short. If the Agreement is to work, we need to make it work now. There is nothing to be gained by further delay or procrastination. There are real risks on all sides if we and all the parties do not move soon to fulfil the will of the people. Allowing a political vacuum to develop is not a responsible option for anyone. The large amount <Col N="882" /> of progress represented by the Agreement has to be followed through and copperfastened.</P>
      <P>I appeal to all with influence to show the goodwill necessary to clear the impasse and to give not just the Agreement, but peace, reconciliation and democracy the chance they deserve. No one has the right, either through their actions or by their failure to act, to frustrate the prospect of a peaceful future for the people of Northern Ireland. The opportunity should be grasped while it is still available.</P>
      <P>People should not refuse to go beyond the minimum required of them. They need to accept that there may be more than one possible interpretation of the Agreement. There are many genuine and legitimate causes of grievance on all sides, even since the Good Friday Agreement. Anyone can put forward plausible reasons in abundance &ndash; why it is others who should move, why it is others who are responsible for creating the impasse or for letting it develop. These arguments have gone round and round in circles, and could go on <i>ad infinitum</i>. As an overriding goal, each of us should assume our own responsibility for making the Agreement work.</P>
      <P>If progress is to be made, it is first essential to establish the institutions. This would have to be on the clear understanding that all major commitments under the Agreement would be fulfilled in good faith within the timescales set out in the Agreement. All the indications are that the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, however desirable as a confidence building measure on its own merits, will not take place in advance of the establishment of the institutions. However, it is equally clear that the institutions will only be sustainable if confidence and trust are built and developed through the fulfilment of commitments under the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The delays in implementing different parts of the Agreement are unfortunately mutually reinforcing and we are coming close to the point where, without progress on institutions, the May 2000 target for achieving the decommissioning of paramilitary arms will soon cease to be credible. Realistically, it is only in the context of a confidence in functioning democratic institutions that it will be possible to persuade the different groups involved to permanently dispose of their weapons.</P>
      <P>Unionism owes it to itself to dispel the persistent doubts about its real willingness to enter into the inclusive partnership and other arrangements it signed up to under the Agreement, especially given the growing loyalist dissident attacks on Catholics which are obviously designed to bring about the collapse of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the severe pressure that some sections of the Nationalist community have been put under, republicans can also do more to assist this situation. The Irish Government acknowledges the inestimable benefits that all the continuing ceasefires have brought. The pledge of office taken by ministers precludes any use or threat of violence and entry into govern<Col N="883" /> ment by Sinn Féin would itself send the most powerful signal that the war is over, as far as republicans are concerned. All armed groups should acknowledge that they also have an inescapable contribution to make to democracy and demilitarisation in Northern Ireland by the permanent removal of weapons from the political scene. The Good Friday Agreement cannot work on the basis that there will not be decommissioning. It will only work if the institutions are established now and if confidence is created that a process of decommissioning will be achieved under the aegis of General de Chastelain and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.</P>
    <P>Historic responsibilities have been placed on the political leaders of this generation. We have a duty to shoulder and not shirk those responsibilities and not place vetoes in the hands of opponents of the Agreement. There are many ways forward available that would be seen as reasonable by most people and that will protect the important principles involved for each party. However, they would also allow the people of Northern Ireland and the island as a whole to enjoy the peace and stability for which they have waited so long.</P>

      <P>It is very important in politics to mean what one says and say what one means. The Taoiseach was asked here last week what would happen if agreement was not reached on or before 30 June as regards the outstanding issues relating to the formation of an executive and the removal of weapons. He said &ldquo;On 1 July we will move this process forward or we will have to look for another way forward&rdquo;. I asked him what this meant. He said it meant the Agreement as it stands would be effectively set aside. On 15 April last the Taoiseach gave a speech in Britain entitled &ldquo;Ireland and Britain &ndash; a new relationship for the new millennium&rdquo; and said of all the relationships between Britain and Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement is the bedrock. It would be very serious if that bedrock was set aside. We should reflect, perhaps a great deal more than the House and public opinion has done, on the gravity of what the Taoiseach said last week &ndash; if agreement is not reached, the Good Friday Agreement will be set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little worried the Taoiseach may have been stating the issue in an unduly stark manner. It is important to understand there is an interplay of issues working on the political parties in Northern Ireland. The looming confrontation at Drumcree is casting its shadow backwards into this month and is making manoeuvre more difficult for the political parties. It is important to understand the historic context of Drumcree and Portadown. There has been confrontation because of marches in that part of the country for the past 200 years. The first known case was in 1788 when a group of Irish volunteers, mostly Protestant, were marching to a service in Arm<Col N="884" /> agh's Protestant Cathedral. The volunteers decided they would celebrate this by playing <i>The Boyne Water</i> and <i>The Protestant Boys</i>. They were stoned by local Catholics and there was a subsequent affray in which people lost their lives. Parades have been at the heart of conflict in Northern Ireland since then. There was a similar conflict at Dolly's Brae in 1849 where again local residents were offended by a parade. In the subsequent row, about 30 people, mostly Catholic, were killed.</P>
    <P>The killing of people, in association with conflicts about parades is, tragically, nothing new in Northern Ireland. It creates a political problem for all those who are trying to make compromises. It is fair to say that people in Ulster, on both sides of the political divide, have a stubborn streak. If they are told &ldquo;Agree to this by 30 June, or else&rdquo;, there is always the risk that the &ldquo;or else&rdquo; will eventuate because of people's resentment at having their options closed off by someone else.</P>
    <P>I hope the approach that is being taken is right. I share the sense of urgency expressed by the Taoiseach. I agree with him that prolonged delay or procrastination does not necessarily make the situation better and can make it worse. I agree with the concern he has expressed about the beleaguered Nationalist community in the vicinity of Portadown who feel unsettled, as do Catholic worshippers in Harryville in south Antrim. However, at the same time, we should bear in mind that the issues of weaponry, decommissioning, policing and power sharing are extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>I hope the British Prime Minister is not applying the same logic in his dealings with Northern parties as was applied at Rambouillet, where the participants were asked, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, would wish to know, to accept the agreement dictated by Madeleine Albright in full, or else. After a long period of bombing, those who dictated those terms at Rambouillet may feel they have been vindicated. However, I am not sure that approach of dictating the terms of peace, which Prime Minister Blair may feel was successfully applied at Rambouillet and in the subsequent discussions following the outbreak of war in Yugoslavia, will necessarily work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach, who I believe has handled this matter with proper caution, subtlety and a clear understanding of principle, will not allow himself to be pushed by the British Prime Minister into taking a position which is unduly incautious in regard to this deadline. As I said, I was surprised he would say that the Agreement will be set aside on 1 July if the deadline is not reached. It was not the sort of black and white statement I expected from him. I suspect the <i>post bellum</i> euphoria being felt in 10 Downing Street may be influencing this approach. I hope that is not necessarily how we will approach this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> I understand the difficulty the republican movement has in commencing decommissioning. It sees putting weapons out of commission as saying, in a sense, that its war was not justified. Most people on these islands would be of the opinion that its war was never justified. That does not make it any easier for those who believe it was justified to concede to a demand or request that is being made by the majority.</P>
    <P>However, the truth of the matter is that the Good Friday Agreement has created a new political reality in which all the issues about who was right and who was wrong in the past can be set aside with honour by everybody. It does not now matter very much whether the IRA was right or wrong in 1970. That matter should now be left, with comfort, to historians to argue; it is not a matter for practical politicians today.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the republican movement needs to retain its large arsenals of Semtex to defend beleaguered Catholics in the Garvaghy Road. Semtex has no defensive purpose and is a purely aggressive weapon. I do not understand why, if Sinn Féin and the republican movement accept that the Good Friday Agreement is a new departure and that there is now a new political reality on this island and between this island and its neighbour, they cannot commence the process of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand but to also be constructively critical of the approach being adopted by the Ulster Unionists. The idea that a gesture of decommissioning in itself changes anything is meaningless. If the IRA wishes to be cynical &ndash; and it is extremely cynical in many of its activities &ndash; it could comply with this request for a gesture. The notion that, somehow or other, making a gesture of getting rid of two or three kalashnikovs or boring a hole in some weaponry and displaying them in a public place would change the political context and that everything would suddenly be all right as far as Unionists are concerned, does not make any sense. If it made sense for Unionists to agree to the Good Friday Agreement at all, a gesture of that nature does not change anything.</P>
    <P>What is clearly necessary is the creation of a political context in which, on one hand, people can begin to believe that Unionists are willing to share power indefinitely with Sinn Féin in good faith, regardless of temporary set backs and disagreements, and that Unionists accept republicans have a place in decision making in Northern Ireland and, on the other hand, in which republicans go to the trouble of convincing the Unionist community that weapons will never be used again.</P>
    <P>It is hard, gesture or no gesture, for that to be done when three people have been killed by the IRA in the past three months. They may have been, in the eyes of the IRA, drug barons, people who were not paying the donations they should have been to the cause or people who gave information about crime in the past and had gone to another <Col N="886" /> country under a witness protection programme. However, that does not really matter. They were people and the IRA, which is on ceasefire, had no right to kill or attempt to kill them. If the republican movement is asking us to accept that there is no intention of using weapons again, that we do not need decommissioning and that we have peace, how is that consistent with the fact that the IRA has apparently killed three people and maimed another in the recent past? </P>
    <P>I would not be as hard as some have been on the IRA over the graves issue. It is possible that after this length of time they have forgotten the precise locations. It is possible that the records within the IRA are not as good as they should be. It may be that this information was volunteered entirely in good faith. However, there is no way that one can adopt an understanding view of the IRA in regard to the killing of three people in the past two months. That is not consistent with being on ceasefire. Killing retired informers or current criminals is not consistent with being on ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The quality of democracy in this jurisdiction is also at stake. While canvassing in Dublin in the recent local elections, I met a lady who said she had been intimidated to prevent her giving evidence as a witness in a serious case involving crime in this city. She was living in fear of her life and wanted me to approach Dublin Corporation to see whether she could be rehoused away from the paramilitaries operating in this city who had threatened her and her children because of her willingness to testify in this case.</P>
    <P>The idea that such intimidation is not being conducted by paramilitaries in this State is wrong. The Taoiseach should understand, as I know he does, that on the issue of the long-term intent in regard to the use of IRA weapons or putting them out of harm's way, we are facing a crisis of confidence in regard to the nature of democracy in this jurisdiction. Do political parties with armed wings have a place in our democracy? I believe they do not have a place in Government at local or national level here as long as they continue to arrogate to themselves the right to be associated with an organisation that has used and is still willing to use guns. There is a fundamental issue here concerning the quality of our democracy. Is it a half-armed democracy or is it a democracy that relies solely on political means to persuade people to change their opinions? Is there a place for paramilitaries in this jurisdiction? That is an issue we must face even if Northern Ireland and the Northern issue did not exist. It is fundamental. Paramilitarism has no place in the domestic politics of this State. The issue of deciding whether the arms issue should be dealt with is not something we in this democratic assembly, the fifth oldest continuous democracy in western Europe, can sub-contract to David Trimble. It is not for us as democrats to say that whatever is satisfactory to David Trimble will be satisfactory to us and that if he is prepared to accept that people who continue to arrogate to themselves the right to hold guns indefinitely can <Col N="887" /> participate with him that we will not cause any difficulties. That is not sufficient. We in this House have a vested interest in guaranteeing the quality of our democracy, which is longer standing and more robust than any form of democracy that has existed in this century in north-east Ulster. Our democracy predates that and has always been genuinely pluralist. Guns have not been part of our democracy at any stage since the State's foundation. That was one of the fundamental achievements of W. T. Cosgrave and Éamon de Valera. I hope the issue of parties that are associated with armed organisations which continue to kill people, even while on ceasefire, will not be put aside in order to reach the deadline of 30 June.</P>
    <P>This agreement and legislation concerning the British-Irish Council and the North-South Council is very important. I welcome the changes that are being made. I hope that in our prosperity we will not forget an earlier generation of Irish people who emigrated to Britain. One of the saddest sights I have ever seen was in a pub in north London frequented by older Irish people. I have seen people sitting around with faded photographs of Leitrim and Louth teams of the 1950s, teams that nobody heard very much about but that mean something to the people who frequent the Spotted Dog in Cricklewood. One sees elderly men sitting there nursing one pint for a whole day. That is all they can afford. It is the only place they can go and be at home with other Irish people. They are extremely lonely. Their families have no interest in them. They cannot afford to go home, even with current relatively cheap air fares. They are cut off from Ireland and the community in Britain. They are alienated from everybody. The level of desperation, illness and suicide among older Irish people is quite serious. In many British cities a disproportionate number of the elderly living alone are Irish. Their community is not being renewed because young Irish people are not emigrating to Coventry, Birmingham or Manchester. These people are completely isolated.</P>
    <P>I have appealed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Government financial support for the establishment of a free phone service in Britain so that such people can talk to other Irish people in Britain who would provide a service similar to that given by an organisation to help the elderly which is located in Summerhill in my constituency and serves the whole country. Older people can telephone and talk about things they do not want to bother their daughter-in-laws with, worries about health, medication, their children and grandchildren, wills and all the things that prey on their minds. At home they can talk about their problems even if their families are far away from them. Older Irish people living in Britain, many of whom never married, have no one to talk to. Often they have no children and their relatives, if they have any, may be living elsewhere. Human contact should not be underestimated. I hope that <Col N="888" /> as part of the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, which hopefully will materialise and will not be held up by the decommissioning issue, the Irish Government will make provision for some assistance to be given for a service that will relieve the loneliness felt by older Irish people living in Britain. Clearly their social welfare entitlements are looked after by the British authorities. However, their spiritual and psychological needs are ones for which we have a continuing responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are the lucky generation. The Irish generation who emigrated in the fifties and in the fifties of the last century are among the most unlucky generations to have inhabited this island. We have a responsibility to the less fortunate generations. I hope that we will not fail to take the opportunity to do something more than we are doing for the older Irish in Britain.</P>

      <P>I want to make some remarks on what Deputy Bruton said about Sinn Féin in the capital city. Commentators who have examined and in some cases misrepresented the vote which Sinn Féin achieved in the Dublin area are missing the point. A colleague of mine explained it succinctly. He said that if he went out to organise a march against drugs in his area, he would be lucky to find half a dozen people to walk with him. If a Sinn Féin activist in the same area organised a march against drugs, he would probably be accompanied by 600 people. He explained that the reason for this was simple. The people marching behind the Sinn Féin activist feel a sense of security from the shadow of the gunman which hangs over that party, security from the drug barons who operate in these communities.</P>
      <P>That is an aspect of the activities of Sinn Féin which must be examined seriously and addressed by the authorities. I am not talking about clamping down on Sinn Féin or on anti-drug activity, I am talking about ensuring that the police force, an excellent force in many ways, is geared to deal with the drug problem in these areas which lose children on a daily basis to the scourge of drugs. It must also be ensured that the services which these families need to cope with drug addiction are available. Unless we deal with the drugs issue effectively through prevention, we will not fully appreciate the problem until we have grown a monster in our midst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In listening to the Taoiseach's speech, I was somewhat alarmed by what he said. I am alarmed because I detect a shift in the position of the Government on decommissioning. In his speech the Taoiseach said that it is first essential to establish the institutions, that all major commitments under the Agreement would be fulfilled in good faith within the timescales set out in the Agreement and that decommissioning will not take place in advance of the establishment of the institutions. He continued that it is equally clear that the institutions will only be sustainable if confidence and trust are built and developed through <Col N="889" /> the fulfilment of commitments under the Agreement. The Taoiseach then said that the pledge of office taken by Ministers precludes the use or threat of violence and entry into Government by Sinn Féin would itself send the most powerful signal that the war is over as far as republicans are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like reassurance from the Taoiseach that the speech is either badly written or I am misreading what he said. It seems that he is saying that Sinn Féin should have places on the Executive before there is any gesture on decommissioning. The Taoiseach is now looking for a commitment from Sinn Féin that decommissioning, which may not take place before the institutions are established, will be completed within the timeframe set out in the Agreement. That will put the Ulster Unionist Party in an untenable position. Before this debate is concluded, by way of coming back into the House or by public statement, the Taoiseach should give a reassurance that the position of the Government has not changed on decommissioning. I am concerned that statement, as it was delivered here, will be interpreted by the Ulster Unionist Party as a shift in the Government position.</P>
    <P>The harsh reality is that unless progress is made within the next ten days in overcoming the very serious obstacles to the establishment of an Executive and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Bill we are now debating will be totally irrelevant as the whole process may collapse, sweeping away the cross-Border bodies agreed by the two Governments and approved in legislation in the Oireachtas and Westminster.</P>
    <P>The nature of this process from its earliest days has been that it has faced crisis after crisis, gone to the brink on numerous occasions, seemed every few months to have run into a dead end, but always, often at the last minute, compromise was found, concessions were made and momentum was maintained. No one should underestimate, however, the seriousness of the situation we now face. The process has been stuck in the sand for several months. The patience of the two Governments and the people, North and South, is close to exhaustion. The deadline of 30 June is a serious one. Unless progress is made before then, the situation for the people of Northern Ireland is bleak, particularly with the unresolved issue of Drumcree looming in the background. In these circumstances one can only fully endorse the call by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for one last enormous effort to find agreement. I do not believe that it is beyond the capacity of the two Governments and the political parties which, against all the odds, successfully negotiated the Good Friday Agreement to find a way forward. Time is running out.</P>
    <P>Despite the euphoria surrounding the Good Friday Agreement and the decisive endorsement of it by the people, North and South, it was evident that the Agreement in itself was not a solution to all the problems of Northern Ireland. <Col N="890" /> The Agreement provided a framework on which the politicians of Northern Ireland could build the edifice of a lasting political structure which would deliver a lasting peace. It is disappointing that in the 14 months since the Agreement was concluded more progress has not been made. It is disappointing but perhaps not surprising, given the history of the Northern Ireland state and the legacy of 30 years of appalling military violence.</P>
    <P>Even as we face into these crucial ten days we should not lose sight of what has been achieved since the Agreement was signed. The paramilitary ceasefires have largely held and while there has been sporadic violence, many more would have died had the Agreement not been concluded. There were positive referendum results in both jurisdictions. There were the assembly elections, followed by the initial meetings of that body, which were held with fewer problems than many had anticipated. There has been a reduction in troop levels, the reopening of Border roads and the establishment of a commission on policing. Hundreds of prisoners have been freed. There are no Provisional IRA prisoners left in jail in Britain and only a handful in jail in the Republic. Agreement has been reached between the two Governments on cross-Border bodies, and European Union money to support the reconciliation process has been guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The question facing all those parties participating in the talks, principally Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party, is, having come so far, will they allow all of this to be jeopardised by a failure to go the last mile? The Ulster Unionist Party must ask itself if it will risk the collapse of the Agreement only to have it replaced by the reinstatement of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which it opposed for so long. Sinn Féin must ask itself if it will risk the collapse of the Agreement and with it the all-Ireland dimension recognised through the North-South bodies.</P>
    <P>The single issue which has presented so many problems since the process began, and which again threatens to undermine all the progress which has been made, is decommissioning. Arguments that decommissioning is unimportant because decommissioned weapons or explosives can be replaced are missing the point. Decommissioning is about building trust and demonstrating absolute commitment to exclusively democratic means of pursuing political belief. Without trust and an absolute commitment to democracy, that process may well founder.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that there is still widespread distrust of the republican movement among the broader Unionist community, a distrust which is not surprising given the events of the past 30 years. Ways have to be found to overcome that distrust. Some movement in the area of decommissioning is essential. The fact is that virtually everyone has compromised on the issue of decommissioning other than the paramilitary organisations. The two Governments softened their positions on a number of occasions to ensure the process was kept afloat. It is often for<Col N="891" /> gotten that the Mitchell report, published in 1996, recommended that there be some decommissioning while the talks took place, but that did not happen. The original position of the Ulster Unionist Party was that it would not take part in talks with Sinn Féin until there was some decommissioning; it compromised on that position.</P>
    <P>The paramilitaries, and their political representatives, alone have refused to make an movement on this issue. They have done so despite the motion agreed by all parties to the Stormont talks in September 1997 that the resolution of the decommissioning issue is an indispensable part of the process of negotiation. Under the terms of the Agreement all parties are required to work constructively and in good faith with the independent commission and to use any influence they may have to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons within two years following endorsement in referendums. It is true no date was set for the start of decommissioning but no date was specified either for the start of the release of prisoners, yet that process is now almost complete.</P>
    <P>The failure to offer any movement together with unconfirmed reports of involvement of the republican movement in three recent murders in Northern Ireland all continue to raise legitimate questions about the democratic credentials of Sinn Féin. One cannot be half a democrat. The commitment to exclusively democratic means of all those parties whose members will hold ministerial office in an executive must be absolute and beyond question. If the republican movement is committed to the Good Friday Agreement, which includes a commitment to the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May of next year &ndash; only 11 months away &ndash; why can it not make some movement, some small gesture, which will break the logjam and allow the full implementation of the Agreement which we all want to see? If it cannot bring itself, for whatever reason, to the actual handing over of arms or explosives, then it is up to it to come up with an alternative strategy to reassure not only Unionists, but all democrats in Northern Ireland of their commitment to the democratic process.</P>
    <P>It must recognise that without the continued support and involvement of the Ulster Unionist Party, the process has no future. It must recognise that of all the political leaders in Northern Ireland, David Trimble is the one who is politically least secure. Does it really relish the prospect of David Trimble being forced out of office by its intransigence and having to negotiate with an Ulster Unionist Party led by somebody with a more inflexible and rigid position? The Ulster Unionist Party must, in turn, accept that if it sets the bar at an unrealistic level and makes it impossible, for whatever reason, for the republican movement to deliver, then all will be lost. The sensible and practical solution seems to be simultaneous movement on both sides. To use a phrase <Col N="892" /> used before, Gerry Adams and David Trimble should jump together.</P>
    <P>Despite all the problems which have been encountered, opinion polls show a continuing level of support consistent with that won in the referendum. Again, in the recent European elections, some 70 per cent of the people voted for pro-Agreement parties. The people of Northern Ireland will take a harsh view of anyone whose intransigence or refusal to move will scupper the Agreement. Regardless of what happens over the next ten days, we must ensure continued funding for the European Union's special support programme for peace and reconciliation which has been supporting practical steps designed to remove the barriers which have thwarted social relationships on both sides of the Border. They have tried to do this in a number of ways: one, by encouraging community development, which is consciously inclusive &ndash; the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation has been to the forefront in challenging old attitudes; two, by empowering marginalised groups in society and providing them with education and employment opportunities and, three, by ensuring the most vulnerable and marginalised are specifically supported.</P>
    <P>While it would be wrong to overstate what has been achieved, there is no doubt it has created a framework in Border areas within which a process of reconciliation can be facilitated. These programmes were put in place following the paramilitary ceasefires in 1994. The fact that they survived the breakdown in 1996, is a tribute to all those involved. It will clearly take a long time to end the legacy of suspicion created by generations of conflict, but the EU peace programme has played an important part in the process of reconciliation and must be allowed to continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate, one which, some weeks ago, we did not believe we would be holding having regard to the passing of the British-Irish Agreement Bill. I acknowledge the technical difficulty which has been brought to the attention of the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and the need for primary rather than secondary legislation. It is fair to say the legislation, however technical in nature, has the support of everybody in the House. It is important there is no legal doubt as to the status of European funding for Northern Ireland. Having regard to the great role played by the European Union in the past in terms of investment in Northern Ireland, that level of investment will continue to be extremely important as we hope the democratic routes take effect and the Agreement and the peace process proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economic development has been assisted by the European Union, particularly the road and rail links. Other infrastructural benefits have been made possible by EU funding. West of the Bann, where there has been a great need for economic regeneration and to ensure employ<Col N="893" /> ment and training is available for citizens and that infrastructural developments can keep apace with those east of the river, there is no rail link, port or air service. It is important in the context of European aid and the various aid projects available that consideration is given to that area.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been of great assistance in community projects which have been put in place, particularly projects to help and assist the rehabilitation and reintegration of those who have been released from prison under the Good Friday Agreement. In the context of post-release welfare, it is important that an appropriate level of training is available and that there is induction by way of skills to ensure people can reintegrate into society in an appropriate manner. It is significant that so far, incidence of re-offending among those who have been released from prison have been particularly low. In fact, it has been almost negligible among those who have benefited under the Agreement and who have come home and availed of the early release scheme. Thankfully, there have been few recorded incidents of persons becoming engaged in unlawful activity.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the fact the status of Northern Ireland has become internationalised. As well as the assistance from the European Union in recent times, it is important to acknowledge the great role played by the United States, which has been acknowledged in the House on many occasions, and perhaps most importantly, the visit of President Clinton two years ago. Maintenance of the current level of economic aid from Europe is important and amounted to 100 million ecus in 1999. The Minister indicated a similar amount of funding will be available over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 80:20 split between Northern Ireland and the Border counties, I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and his colleagues from the Border constituencies will have something to say about it. It is important to ensure there is a level available to the Border counties that have suffered considerably because of the absence of normality over the past 30 years or more.</P>
    <P>As Deputy De Rossa said, the Bill will only be of significance in the event of progress being made on the Agreement in the multi-party negotiations over the next ten days. I listened to what the Taoiseach said and noted in the context of what was quoted by the previous speaker a change in the signal he is sending out when he said that the Agreement &ldquo;will only work if the institutions are established now and if confidence is created that a process of decommissioning will be achieved under the aegis of General de Chastelain and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement&rdquo;. I am not sure one can point to an element of contemporaneous movement in the context of the use of the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; on two occasions in this extract as it seems the Taoiseach has indicated that the institutions could be established now, that confidence would be created and that following that a process of decommissioning would be achieved. This seems <Col N="894" /> to signal a change from the article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> in which the Taoiseach spoke about the compatibility or possibility of having people serving on the Executive without the commencement of or movement on decommissioning. I wonder where stands this interview which was carried in the <i>Sunday Times</i> eight or ten weeks ago <i>vis-à-vis</i> his statement earlier this evening.</P>
    <P>Looking at what has been achieved puts into context the great difficulties faced over the next few days. It would be unthinkable to suggest that everything which has been done to date has been for nought. There have been changes in security arrangements in terms of demilitarisation and normalisation which to some extent have changed the landscape in Border areas, physically with the removal of some of the military posts, and in west Belfast where troops on the street are a thing of the past. There has been a recognition on the part of the security forces that the process of normalisation should be considered positively. Considerable progress has also been made in policing and justice by the police commission, under the chairmanship of Chris Patten, which is due to report before the end of our summer recess. Progress on the prisoner issue has been so positive that it puts other areas of the Agreement, particularly that concerning decommissioning, very much in the spotlight. Today a very high profile prisoner was released showing the resolve on the part of the British Government to continue with the early release programme for prisoners in spite of the fact that there are areas of the Agreement where little or no progress can be reported. There has been progress in terms of UK human rights legislation and the review of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>We have enacted much legislation in this jurisdiction, including that concerning the North-South bodies and that dealing with the graves of the disappeared, legislation which was not part of the Agreement but which was considered necessary. One wonders whether we, as democratically elected parliamentarians, were sold a pup by the republican movement in terms of this legislation. Certainly, there has been grave disappointment on the part of the families who have suffered horrendous insult and injury following the great trauma and difficulty imposed on them. Their most recent experience has been horrific and has brought little from the republican movement other than hand wringing as it says that what has happened is not really its fault and that it has given as much information as it has. The debacle surrounding the graves of the disappeared is totally unacceptable. Within a few weeks of an initial statement from the republican movement we enacted legislation of an emergency nature which would be unknown and unheard of in many democratic states. However, we were prepared to accept an element of good faith from people who did not reciprocate in terms of providing an equal measure of good faith not only to us as parliamentarians and to the British and Irish Governments, but more particularly to the families of the <Col N="895" /> victims who have suffered silently and without support for decades.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that decommissioning is an issue upon which there will have to be some positive movement. In our democratic State, it would be unthinkable to suggest that a party commanding sufficient votes to allow for a number of seats in our democratically elected Parliament could sit in Cabinet in a coalition Government while at the same time it was in a position to at least license a return to terror or the engagement of a private army. We would find this totally unacceptable and I do not think we should wish different circumstances to obtain in Northern Ireland from those we would tolerate or wish to see in operation in this jurisdiction. The reality remains that Sinn Féin still must show and convince us that it has crossed the Rubicon and embarked upon constitutional politics in the form of a total and exclusive commitment to the ballot box and has turned its back on the armalite. The leadership of the party has not said this in clear and concise terms. It was most shocking to see on television evidence of paramilitarism in terms of balaclavas, military gear and sun glasses at the republican commemoration in Bodenstown at the weekend which was addressed by prominent members of Sinn Féin. What was the reason for such a display? Why was there a need to have these people present if Sinn Féin has crossed the Rubicon and is engaging exclusively in constitutional politics and the politics of democracy? It was a most unfortunate and distasteful show of strength which at such a crucial time in the peace process could be considered most unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Some form of movement in the decommissioning issue is essential. We have debated this before but people still need convincing that Semtex can be regarded as a weapon of defence. Although there is a remarkably high supply of Semtex on this island, none of it has been handed over in a genuine attempt on the part of the Republican movement to demonstrate to those who doubt its commitment that it is prepared to engage in an element of disarmament, in spite of the fact that the Agreement signed over a year ago makes it clear. Paragraph 4 of the decommissioning section states:</P>
    <P>The Independent Commission [, that is General de Chastelain,] will monitor, review and verify progress on decommissioning of illegal arms, and will report to both Governments at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>General de Chastelain has not reported anything because he has had nothing to report. It is some months since Mr. Martin McGuinness decided to sit on that committee as a liaison officer and yet there is little report of positive progress. General de Chastelain has made no public statement to date. We are told by Republicans that he is <Col N="896" /> happy. We will probably know pretty soon if he is. He does not have any political authority to advance the process. As much as he would like to take an initiative, it is not within his remit to do so. So much has been left to his judgment and so much in terms of a breakthrough has been placed on his shoulders that I am not sure if his legal standing will allow him to make such a breakthrough.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill is legislation which the Government states is essential in the context of the Agreement. I am not sure we will have an opportunity to process the remaining legislation, that is the human rights Bill and perhaps one or two others that need to be enacted, because we are approaching the high fence, which is the last day of June. The jumping of that fence is beyond the remit, scope, power or authority of anyone in this House. It is out of our hands. It is up to those parties who have signed the Agreement to carry out the Declaration of Support to the Agreement, which states:</P>
    <P>We affirm our total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of resolving differences on political issues, and our opposition to any use or threat of force by others for any political purpose, whether in regard to this agreement or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is up to those who have signed the Agreement to ensure that the section dealing with decommissioning is brought, if not up to date, at least to a position where progress can be reported in the same way as other areas of the Agreement can visibly report considerable progress. I hope that can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed Deputy Flanagan seems to be inclining towards pessimism about the present process and the journey we are making towards peace. I remain an optimist. The fiasco over the disappeared has been extremely unfortunate. Regrettably when one deals with disorganised and secretive conspiratorial organisations like the IRA one is apt to find oneself in this situation. I hope for the sake of the families concerned that those bodies are produced. It is not an easy job and I cannot imagine after so many years of conflict that it would be easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's reference to private armies. All three Members present belong to parties that have been accused of having private armies at various stages. I refer to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Workers Party. We have all belonged to parties that are alleged to have had private armies. Unfortunately that is one of the legacies of Irish history. All parties, with the exception of the Progressive Democrats, are splinters of movements that were founded on the use of violence. That is part of our history which <Col N="897" /> I hope we will put behind us in the way the parties to which I referred have done over a period in a consistent and forthright manner.</P>
    <P>I would not take too much note of graveside juju, such as people wearing paramilitary regalia, etc., at Bodenstown or elsewhere. I would not be too disappointed at that. There is a considerable element of the boy scout approach involved in these types of events, particularly in the context of a people moving towards peace. There are always certain people within organisations for whom that is the primary appeal. I would not take it too seriously. I suppose they must also take those people with them. Parading at Bodenstown is rather harmless compared to engaging in violence and alternative activities that might be entertained.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the Taoiseach's succinct contribution, the key phrase of which was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement cannot work on the basis that there will not be decommissioning. It will only work if the institutions are established now and if confidence is created that a process of decommissioning will be achieved under the aegis of General de Chastelain and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.</P>
    <P>While we hope there will be decommissioning we must hope more than anything else that the institutions are put in place so that we can achieve that goal. It must be stated clearly that those parties that obstruct the creation of these institutions are flying in the face of democracy and should not be entertained. They should be rigidly faced down because the Agreement is backed by a referendum. The Irish people, North and South, wish these institutions to be set up and an end to the nit-picking. The public has travelled far in advance of even all the signatories of the Good Friday Agreement and it is up to political leaders of every kind, including Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson MP, to recognise that the people want peace and prosperity.</P>
    <P>Many years ago Deputy De Rossa's party had the slogan &ldquo;peace, jobs and progress&rdquo;. It is an aphorism but it is also a truism. That is what people want and not the old empty historical rhetoric of the past and continuous nit-picking with regard to peace and relationships on this island.</P>
    <P>We referred to the issue of decommissioning earlier. In regard to reform of the RUC, I do not know whether many Members watched the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; special last night but some of the information which emerged about the RUC and the Chief Constable was shocking and alarming. I do not intend to rush to condemn Mr. Ronnie Flanagan who, like anyone else, deserves a fair hearing. However, the British Government must investigate his role in and comments on the Rosemary <Col N="898" /> Nelson affair which has cut to the very quick of the Nationalist dilemma in the Six Counties. If we are to make any advances and ensure confidence in the years ahead, the role of the RUC, particularly in regard to the murder of Rosemary Nelson, must be thoroughly investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their thoughtful contributions to the Bill. Deputy Bruton expressed concern that the Agreement might be set aside and acknowledged that Drumcree made matters more difficult for all parties. The Deputy may be assured that the Agreement will not be set aside lightly. Intensive negotiations have been ongoing for the past number of months and will continue up to the deadline. If we are to achieve final agreement, all parties must move on from their current stated positions. If we fail to secure such movement, it is difficult to see how we can advance matters towards signing off on all aspects of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>We share Deputy Bruton's concern about the situation at Drumcree and call on those in the Nationalist and Unionist communities, and those in the Orange Order, to exercise restraint in order that further tragedies and loss of life will be avoided. We hope the communities will be able to see past their present difficulties and envisage a better future under the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also raised a matter of which the Government has been very conscious, namely, the position of elderly Irish people living in Britain. The Taoiseach recently announced support, under the Irish Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust legislation, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds for a range of projects which will <Col N="899" /> provide accommodation, day centres, community centres and assistance for individuals throughout Britain to meet the needs of the people referred to by Deputy Bruton. The Deputy referred specifically to Coventry. Support will be provided by Rehab in that city for the provision of facilities for elderly Irish people to allow them to meet each other.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to the point raised by Deputy De Rossa. There is no change in the Government's position. The Agreement does not make decommissioning a precondition for entry to, or participation in, the Executive. The Taoiseach and the Government have maintained this position throughout the process. The obligations in regard to decommissioning contained in the Agreement relate to the timeframe set out therein, namely up to the May 2000 deadline. The Taoiseach, in his speech, simply reiterated and underlined this position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <P>In response to a parliamentary question which I tabled, the Taoiseach indicated that there could not be any executive without Sinn Féin but that Sinn Féin could not take part in any executive without decommissioning &ndash; one presumes that means a start on decommissioning, not complete decommissioning. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that statements made in speeches by the Taoiseach seem to move away from that position. The Minister's clarification does not reassure me that there is not a move away from that earlier stated position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had addressed the matter. However, let me re-emphasise the point for the purposes of absolute clarity. The Taoiseach has spoken about this issue on many occasions. There is no change in the Government's position. That categorical, unequivocal and absolute position must be put on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the parts of the Agreement which are still being progressed in spite of the existence of problems in other areas. A great deal of work has been done in the area of human rights and we hope to continue to progress these matters. There is already an increasing level of co-operation between North and South on many economic and social areas. It is important that we do not lose sight of the benefits which have accrued from the Agreement to date. The major task facing us now is to convince those parties who are unsure that the Agreement will result in a better way of life in Northern Ireland. I, and other Members of the House, have no <Col N="900" /> doubt that the Agreement will bring a better way of life to Northern Ireland.</P>

The IRA's declaration of the location of the body of the unfortunate Mrs. McConville was the cruellest in the last 35 years. To see an entire family assembled on a Saturday afternoon saying the rosary and praying that the body of their mother would be revealed while the Irish Dr. Mengele, the Angel of Death, Gerry Adams, was canvassing one mile away in the villages of Greenore and Carlingford was heart-rending. Democracry has many defects when this can happen. He should have been on his knees with a pick and shovel helping to reveal the resting place of that unfortunate woman. To subject her family to a fortnight of anguish was an absolute disgrace in a civilised country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to introduce this Bill which contains a number of important changes to an area of law which has remained unaltered for almost 100 years. In spite of good intentions and numerous promises since the foundation of the State, little has been done to modernise and reform our corruption laws. Corruption is not widespread in Irish public life. Allegations of corruption have been few. The vast majority of persons in the public sector and public life generally act with honour and a high degree of professionalism in carrying out their duties.</P>
      <P>In introducing this legislation I am not by any means alleging that corruption is rife in the State. It is undeniable, however, that the close links between politics and business give rise to a perception on the part of many that they are not transparent and have the potential to be widely regarded as being contrary to the public good and, in many ways, unhealthy and unsavoury.</P>
      <P>By international standards, Ireland is not perceived as being a corrupt state. According to the head of the Australian independent commission against corruption who addressed a select committee of the House last year, there are statistics to indicate that Ireland ranks fourteenth on the corruption perception index. This means that we are not as good as Denmark, which is seen as being the least corrupt, or Australia, which is seen as being the eighth least corrupt. We are, however, better than Pakistan and Nigeria which come in forty-ninth and fiftieth, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> I am not sure how secure we can feel by examining this list in detail but there is no room for complacency. There is no overt public corruption on the scale of some Third World countries. It could be contended that our relatively high standing in the corruption perception index means that we have little to worry about. We could try harder but our performance is better than most and outstandingly better than some. We can hold our heads high on the international stage, at least according to some observers and experts.</P>
    <P>Against this, however, the fact remains that our corruption laws are outdated and need to be redefined in the form of a modern statute. This Bill is the first to deal with corruption since 1916. It deals with bribery, the payment of secret commissions, payola and the misuse of information for personal gain. It is clear that corruption encourages criminal activity, undermines confidence in democracy, wastes public resources, distorts trade and fosters a black economy. Corruption retards economic development, debases standards and, ultimately, undermines confidence in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>There is a large degree of public cynicism regarding the operation of business and public life. In spite of the many tribunals established during the past ten years, our corruption laws remain obsolete, outdated and even irrelevant. This Bill would ensure the law and the threat of prosecution can represent a strong deterrent against corruption in commercial business and public life.</P>
    <P>As the existing 83 year old law stands, only one person in the State was convicted under our corruption code in the past 13 years. Strangely, neither the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform nor the Garda Síochána are able to supply any figures for the number of prosecutions or convictions prior to 1986. Such statistics are unavailable.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter by way of parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last year when I asked the number of prosecutions brought since 1960 in relation to offences under the Public Bodies (Corrupt Practices) Act, 1889, and the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1906 and 1916, and the number of acquittals and convictions in these prosecutions. The reply stated:</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the period before 1986 is not readily available and could only be obtained by the use of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources. From 1986 to 1989, however, there were no prosecutions. In 1990, there were three prosecutions against the same individual. A <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered in all three cases. In 1991 and 1992, there were no prosecutions. In 1993, there was <Col N="904" /> one prosecution. In 1994, 1995 and 1996, there were no prosecutions. I am informed that the statistics for 1997 have not yet been published and are, therefore, not available.</P>
    <P>I believe there was one since. Perhaps the Minister will confirm there was no more than one.</P>
    <P>Against the background of growing public concern and cynicism towards business and public affairs, and with continued scandals and allegations of malpractice throughout society, this Bill is both appropriate and timely. The practice of bribery, corruption, payola and secret commissions strike at the very root of democracy and such malpractice shatters the confidence of the citizen in the rule of law. Such conduct whereby people make personal gain by dishonestly setting aside their duty of care and high standards is unacceptable and intolerable.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates a number of new offences. For the first time bribery is being defined in statute, in response to the need for a modern statutory offence of bribery, and will include new offences of procuring a breach of duty by deception or by threats or intimidation. In common law, under which the law on bribery is covered at present, the specific offence of bribery is difficult to define. As a result it has evolved over time and judicial opinion has differed as to its applicability. This is why very few prosecutions appear before the courts.</P>
    <P>A necessary ingredient for a successful prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1899 to 1916, is that the bribe or inducement should be offered or received corruptly. Nowhere is the word &ldquo;corruptly&rdquo; defined in legislation. Its meaning has been the subject of judicial interpretation and is less than certain. In this Bill the term &ldquo;corruptly &ldquo; is defined in law for the first time. Section 1 states: &ldquo;&lsquo;Corruptly' means to destroy or pervert the integrity or fidelity of a person in the discharge of his or her duty, and shall include an inducement to act in a dishonest or unfaithful manner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the early part of the century when our corruption laws were framed there was a perception and a presumption in law that a higher standard of care and conduct was required in the public sector than in the private commercial sector. This was most appropriate for the time but it is out of date in the 1990s. The 1916 Act applies only where a bribe has been paid to a person in a public body. This is now inadequate having regard to the privatisation of many institutions in recent years with particular reference to those in the area of transport, communications and a wide range of other utilities.</P>
    <P>Last week the House passed a motion on the Council of Europe agreement establishing the Group of States Against Corruption. This could be viewed as a worthy motion passed by the Parliament of the 14th least corrupt state, but the reality is different. The introduction of this <Col N="905" /> motion was an act of breathtaking and cynical opportunism on the part of this Government which has a long wish-list in the area of law reform. Government inaction and inertia on criminal law reform in areas relating to bribery and corruption would surely push us well down the list of least corrupt states. Quite apart from matters of international standing, the lack of effective criminal law reform in this area is fuelling the engine of cynicism and disaffection with the political process.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that two years into the present regime progress has been slow and uninspiring. As I stated some weeks ago, it was unwise of Government to amalgamate the Department of Justice with the very successful Department of Equality and Law Reform. The newly-merged Department is not in a position to deal with the huge volume of work needed in the criminal and civil law reform areas. Once again I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a special arm of the Law Reform Commission to deal with criminal legal matters and to set targets for reports on the many areas of criminal law which require attention.</P>
    <P>Coupled with this situation are the tens of Law Reform Commission reports produced over the years on which there has been no follow up action by the Government. It is essential that the Minister engages in a review of these reports and indicates which reports are to be acted upon and when, which are in the course of being acted upon, which are to be confined to the bin and why. Many of these reports have been gathering dust for many years with no action, intention of action or mention. That is why it would be helpful if the Government gave such indications.</P>
    <P>In framing this legislation, Fine Gael is conscious of the widespread cynicism that exists towards politicians and the practice of politics. I hope the Government will accept the Bill on Second Stage. This would allow the legislation to be considered in greater detail on Committee Stage. If there are Government amendments, Committee Stage is the best forum to debate and deliberate on the issue.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence from the sharply falling graph of voter participation in elections that there is a growing apathy and widespread cynicism about the political process and its relationship with business and finance. There is a perception that for politicians, public servants and those in the higher echelons of the business and financial sectors, different rules, moral and ethical standards and codes apply to such people. Even when actually proven to have been &ldquo;on the take&rdquo;, different sanctions seem to apply. This perception has become more widespread and has been openly discussed in recent years. However, its evolution is not of very recent origin, it reached its current proportions through the exposition of <Col N="906" /> layer upon layer of financial and political scandals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some of the origins of this perception are to be found in the clientelism system of politics which operates. In the past, this system fostered the belief that unless one had access to those in the know, the citizen was unlikely to get anything done, and even the most basic individual rights of the citizen could be frustrated if the system was not used to good effect. Unfortunately, there are public representatives who still enthusiastically endorse this approach and cynically abuse the position by, for example, contacting the local superintendent regarding a road traffic offence or directly interfering with the workings of the Garda Síochána, the Revenue collector or the chief planning officer at local authority level. Unfortunately this practice was commonplace until very recently. The impression still exists in many quarters that without the help and direct influence of a TD, a person cannot get a job in the prison service, the Garda Síochána or the public service, thus compounding the impression that there are rules which can be circumvented by those in positions of authority and that there is an inside track accessible only to a chosen few who happen to be close to the public representative.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that as clientelism is becoming an unpalatable part of the political process <i>vis-à-vis</i> public representatives and their constituents, the professional lobbyists, or public affairs consultants, as they prefer to be known, are making a very good living by fostering precisely the same system. They charge corporate clients hefty fees for making a few telephone calls to the political movers and shakers, and for performing introductions at meetings. This gives the impression that what they are selling is exclusive and special access. Wheels within wheels are still turning and, with each rotation, handsome dividends are paid to some.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to imply that the perception that there is widespread corruption in politics, business and finance is based only on people's knowledge of the cynical manipulation of the system. The proliferation of tribunals of inquiry over recent years have uncovered evidence of real, not perceived, corruption. In many cases there was proof of collusion between those in the higher echelons of politics and business interests.</P>
    <P>I wish to cite a number of examples. A well-connected friend of a former senior Government Minister buys some prime land in Dublin city centre, builds an office block and finds that an acquiescent Government is more than willing to pay him lots of taxpayers' money to rent his premises.</P>
    <P>Second, a well connected businessman buys land on a college campus and fortuitously finds that an acquiescent Government speedily provides another college with the resources to buy the land and to provide the friend with a hand<Col N="907" /> some profit courtesy of the taxpayer. This story has never been investigated and the truth has never been discovered, in spite of the fact that there are many in this House who know exactly what went on, the key players, when it went on, who was involved, how and why. There are Ministers serving in Government now who served in Government when these deals were struck. Members of the present Government are in a position to clarify the facts which have not yet been uncovered.</P>
    <P>Third, a beef baron, with impeccable political connections, was alleged to have presided over the abuse of a monopoly position while at the same time was suspected of questionable practices, taking advantage of the European taxpayer. Some years later, many of those featuring highly in the report of the beef tribunal report are still operating successfully, yet the scandal remains that only two employees at a very low level of operation were convicted of malpractice by the courts.</P>
    <P>Fourth, a US businessman hires a &ldquo;well connected&rdquo; party fund raiser to act as a broker and facilitator in a passport application. The American makes a payment termed &ldquo;an interest free loan&rdquo; to the party via the broker and the passport issues in due course. The evidence of the golden circle shines brightest in the days of the 1980s and early 1990s. The GUBU era was possible only because Mr. Haughey was facilitated. The facilitators were not only the yes men and women in his own party who turned a blind eye because they were anxious to be part of the glory days, but also large business and banking interests who saw, rightly, that their own empire building could be accelerated by giving or getting the nod from &ldquo;The Boss&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Current tribunals are investigating allegations of corruption. Corruption seems to have been evident both high up and low down. It did not only involve the rich and influential but those who sought to be rich through being influential. These are the indulgence sellers of the 20th century. For a small down payment, salvation can be assured. Corruption &ndash; evident or perceived &ndash; is corrosive. It affects society adversely. It leads to widespread cynicism and ultimately undermines and shatters the pillars and basic principles of democracy.</P>
    <P>There is a huge degree of public cynicism regarding the operation of the many tribunals since 1991. They are seen to have had little impact in spite of their huge cost to the taxpayer. Much of the work of the current tribunals could be made easier if there was a code of law to which they could refer detailing clearly defined offences of a criminal nature. The aim and objective of all Members in this House must be to ensure that a clear line is drawn between politics and business and that this line is real and workable, not appar<Col N="908" /> ent and blurred. The ethics in public office legislation, introduced by the Rainbow Government, went some way towards identifying that line but more is needed. This Bill can go a long way towards redressing the imbalance by introducing significant and necessary reforms.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the Bill are, first, a new statutory offence of bribery, punishable by seven years in prison. The offence of bribery must have the following characteristics&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind the Deputy that 25 minutes of the 40 minutes allocated have elapsed. A number of other Members wish to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude as quickly as possible. The offence of bribery must have the following characteristics &ndash; dishonesty, intent, giving, offering or promising a benefit to a donor, a recipient and, in most cases, an agent or third party.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill provides for a new offence of offering or receiving a secret commission, applying where an agent takes a payment from another as an inducement or reward for doing any action in relation to the business of a principal. A banker, for example, who corruptly receives money from a customer as an inducement for giving the customer preferential treatment when approving certain financial accommodation or a loan or settling an account, would be guilty of receiving such a secret commission. Likewise, the customer would be guilty of an offence. This section would also cover many in the financial services sector advertising and offering to arrange loans for people at high and totally unfair commission.</P>
      <P>Third, a person &ndash; for example, the chairman of an interview board or an examiner &ndash; who is engaged in the business of making disinterested selections or examinations in respect of a priority or service, and where that official dishonestly asks for or receives a benefit for himself or herself, shall be guilty of an offence which is, in effect, &ldquo;payola&rdquo;. Fourth, a public official who gains an unfair benefit from information at his or her disposal shall be guilty of an offence provided the information is used in a dishonest manner.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a section outlining the circumstances under which a defence may not be offered. This is unusual but necessary because of the widespread perception that what is regarded as common business practice and, perhaps, routine and accepted behaviour does not amount to corruption and is, therefore, perfectly within the law. The burden of proof shall be placed on the shoulders of a person charged in any action under the Bill. This is a fairly radical departure which will undoubtedly be controversial but it is necessary having regard to the obvious difficulties in proving a case beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> All Members of the House have recently been on the hustings in the course of the European and local elections as candidates or canvassers. I am sure the vast majority met members of the public who showed polite but complete indifference to their exhortations to vote. They did not care even to engage in argument or debate. Many met constituents who were angry and who said: &ldquo;You are all the same up there &ndash; a bunch of gangsters&rdquo;, &ldquo;you are on the take&rdquo; and &ldquo;you are only in it for the money&rdquo;. How many, struck by those comments and stung by the accusations, responded by merely passing the buck and acknowledging that &ldquo;someone somewhere should do something about it&ldquo;? To be honest, how many of us were surprised that these allegations were made?</P>
    <P>We are all culpable; we are all guilty. We are not guilty of corruption or acquiescence with or facilitation of corrupt practices but we are guilty of not rooting it out. We are guilty of hand wringing and verbal condemnation and of the &ldquo;something must be done&rdquo; syndrome. It is interesting to note the catalogue of promises made by the Taoiseach and his Ministers over the past 12 months on tightening up our corruption code. On numerous occasions, stronger ethics legislation and reform of our criminal law in the area of white collar crime has been described as &ldquo;imminent&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the course of preparation&rdquo; and &ldquo;under review&rdquo;. However, two years into the current Administration and with the Civil Service and parliamentary draftsmen available to it, the Government has failed to deliver. In some cases, it has been shown that the Government has a difficulty complying with the legislation that is already in place.</P>
    <P>We must give power to the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply sanctions. A tightening up of our corruption code must be accompanied by an increase in resources for the Garda Síochána to enable its members to detect fraud and corruption. Every effort should be made on the part of the State to ensure that proper and adequate resources for this special Garda fraud unit are appropriate.</P>
    <P>As recently stated by the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, three questions currently dominate the political scene. Will the Celtic tiger survive? How can its benefits be more evenly distributed? Finally, an ethical question, to what extent has financial misbehaviour corrupted society and its political system? The passage of this Bill will be a clear signal that this House has, at last, got its political priorities right and is determined to bring our corruption law up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the Bill. I thank my colleague, <Col N="910" /> Deputy Flanagan, for bringing this legislation before the House and for facilitating a timely debate on this issue. It is timely for a number of reasons, including those already outlined by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
      <P>The world appears to be becoming smaller, particularly with regard to trade and work, as a result of the introduction of new technology. It is imperative, therefore, that legislation appertaining to corruption or fraud is updated. As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, we have not had an update in this area of law since 1916. While we have achieved the position of the 14th least corrupt country in the pecking order, I am not sure that puts us in an advantageous position. I assume some of the other countries in that pecking order are sufficiently adept to make it almost impossible to get past a certain level. It is important to examine the need for the legislation and that we pass this Bill.</P>
      <P>No one can banish malpractice or eliminate it entirely. However, we can introduce legislation which makes it clear to perpetrators that they can and will be caught and dealt with. It is also important at this stage to be able to give a clear message to people, whether in the public or private sector, those in public life and those in business that certain rules, guidelines and regulations must be complied with in a rigid fashion and, if not, that there is a price to be paid. If we do not send out that message clearly, we are open to the suggestion that we are part of a major scam, that we do not have the guts, determination, dedication or intention to pursue corruption. As Deputy Flanagan said, that would leave us open to the charge that all politicians are the same, that we are part of the culture which allows corruption to happen and that we are on a gravy train enjoying its benefits regularly. That is insulting to Members and to the vast majority of people in the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>However, we are a small country and the world is a much smaller place than it was. The advent of technology makes it easier than it was 25, 50 or 60 years ago for a person to use information at their disposal to their advantage or that of their friends. It is important this legislation is given an airing and is given the necessary teeth to ensure that, when put in place &ndash; I hope it is accepted by the Government &ndash; it gives a clear signal to those inside and outside the House that we are serious about proceeding in this direction.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the people, other countries have a strange reputation in terms of the application of the law and they would be familiar with corruption. That does not mean, just because we happen to rank more highly than such countries, we should become complacent and because several countries are worse than us. We should try to set the highest possible standard and put in place legislation to encourage those for whom it is intended to stay within its guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> Corruption has many facets. Deputy Flanagan mentioned interviews as an example. An interview in Ireland is not the same as one in the United States because it is a small country with a small population. A poor, unfortunate person coming before an interview board in either the public or private sector must wonder whether they have an equal a chance with everyone else. Looking at interview boards, I would have reservations as to whether they would. It is probable that someone on an interview board knows a candidate and either likes or dislikes them or knows one of their relatives and either likes or dislikes them. On that basis, it could well be that a person in such a situation would not have an equal chance. That cannot be allowed. It may also be the case that the interviewer is honest and above board and does all that he or she is supposed to do, but that the interviewee sees himself or herself as a victim and reaches the conclusion that all interviewers are the same because the individual was not successful.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the proposals in the legislation. There is a need to focus attention on the issue. I hope the Government takes it on board and supports it to ensure we are seen to do something to give a signal to those at whom the Bill is aimed which will, in turn, be of benefit to us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. Its necessity is probably due to the scandals which have unfolded in recent years. The public may have become immune to trials, tribunals and investigations, but were it not for the accidental discovery of some of the scandals in recent years, an acceptance of the culture that money could buy any favour would by now have gripped the country. Disclosures of events show that there was a ready acceptance of this culture by previous Fianna Fáil Governments. The actions and reactions of the Government suggest it also accepts this culture.</P>
      <P>Two examples highlight this. The first is the EU Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, and the alleged payment of £50,000. What amazed me about this was not whether the money was retained or handed over to Fianna Fáil but the lack of concern on the part of the Taoiseach about the reason for the payment in the first place. The second in the case of the alleged two payments of £30,000 to the former Minister, Ray Burke. No astonishment or condemnation was expressed by the Taoiseach about such large sums of money changing hands. This leads one to believe that this was an accepted practice within Fianna Fáil, that it was the done thing. Perhaps the establishment of the tribunals, the subsequent exposure of such activities and legislation such as this Bill will help establish in the public mind that such behaviour is unacceptable and must end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> The greatest opportunity for corruption appears to lie in the planning process where rezoning or the granting of planning permission can greatly enhance the value of land. This should not be confused with councillors' legitimate right, when dealing with county or city development plans, to rezone land in an orderly fashion. That is a separate matter. Property development is occurring at an ever increasing rate and there is great pressure on planning authorities to deal with planning applications quickly and positively. This can lead to checks and balances not being applied properly.</P>
    <P>Planning departments in cities and counties throughout the country are hopelessly understaffed. In County Galway, the planning authority is dealing with twice the number of planning applications it dealt with two years ago. A similar situation applies in Galway city, yet the planning authority only has an additional two planning officers. It is hopelessly understaffed and nothing much can be done about it. To employ a planner on a permanent basis, permission must be sought from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government whose responsibility this is, the Local Appointments Commission advertises the position and holds interviews. The process can take up to two years. The Minister should give councils the necessary staff so that the pressure on planners will be eased.</P>
    <P>This is a sensitive area which, because of the pressure on planning authorities, is open to being abused if the will is there to do so. Most councils, because of the pressure under which those people work, employ temporary planning staff who move into the private sector at the first available opportunity, thereby creating a huge turnover of staff. That is no way to operate such a sensitive operation.</P>
    <P>A number of the scandals and a certain amount of the alleged corruption exposed in recent years relate to planning matters. I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to convince the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of the need to provide councils with adequate staff to allow them to deal competently with the increasing number of planning applications with which they are obliged to deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the proposal by the Opposition to amend the Prevention of Corruption Acts. It goes without saying that everyone in this House, across all parties, would, in principle, support any measure which would improve the law on corruption or the implementation of that law. Only last week I secured the agreement of the House to the terms of a Council of Europe Agreement establishing the Group of States against Corruption, under which participating states, including Ireland, will have their adherence to Council of <Col N="913" /> Europe anti-corruption standards monitored. The question is not, therefore, whether this House supports improvements to the law on corruption, because I take that for granted, but whether the proposal before the House will actually improve that law. I believe it would not, and that, in certain respects, it would weaken existing law.</P>
      <P>Before I give my detailed views on that, I will recall for the benefit of the House that I am preparing a Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill which will enable Ireland to become a party to three important international agreements on corruption. The Bill will significantly expand the scope of the Prevention of Corruption Acts to cover categories of persons not covered by it at present, for example, Members of this House and Members of the Seanad. It will also make important technical improvements to the law.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, it agreed earlier this year to my suggestion that my proposals should be sent to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. We had a useful exchange of views with the committee on my proposals and I was grateful to its members for their positive reaction and for some technical suggestions they made. The Bill is being prepared by the parliamentary draftsman and I expect to be in a position to publish it later this year.</P>
      <P>Let me turn now to the proposal before the House which is deeply disappointing. I say that while making full allowance for the fact that this is a Private Members' Bill prepared without the resources or advice available to the Government. I say that not from any negative attitude on my part towards Private Members' Bills &ndash; in fact I believe that in Opposition I did what I could to highlight their importance in the process of law reform &ndash; but based on an objective analysis of the proposals.</P>
      <P>I believe that every fair minded person who listens impartially to what I have to say will conclude that my criticisms are well based and I ask Deputies opposite not to instinctively reject such criticisms, just as they would not like the Government to instinctively reject the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 1 provides for the definition of words used in the Bill. The first definition sets out the circumstances in which an advantage is accepted or conferred corruptly, namely, if it is an inducement or reward to act or refrain from acting in any way which has a substantial tendency to encourage a person, or his or her agent, to act in breach of his or her duty. The definition is based, as far as I can see, with some minor adjustments which are of no consequence, on a provisional proposal of the UK Law Commission at paragraph 8.20 of its consultation paper on corruption. The purpose of the proposal <Col N="914" /> was to spell out what is actually meant by the word &ldquo;corruptly&rdquo;, which is not at present defined in the Prevention of Corruption Acts. In the event, the Law Commission in its final report recommended an entirely different approach.</P>
      <P>A proposed key definition in the Bill, therefore, is based on a provisional proposal of the UK Law Commission which the commission itself has rejected. It is difficult to imagine a more authoritative rejection. The House is being invited to put into the heart of our Prevention of Corruption Acts a concept which, on reflection, has been abandoned by the very experts who provisionally proposed it. If the proponents of the Bill were willing, as it seems they were, to accept the provisional proposal, why do they not now accept its considered rejection? This is so because there are compelling reasons that the proposal is inadequate.</P>
      <P>The Bill would define the corrupt acceptance or conferral of an advantage in terms of an encouragement to a person, or his or her agent, to act in breach of duty. This seems, as it seemed on reflection to the United Kingdom Law Commission, to be too limited. It would not cover many situations which I believe the House would wish to be covered, for example, where payments are made to a person in a public position even though no act is performed which is actually in breach of his or her duty. Apart from the obvious impropriety of such payments, which all of us would instinctively accept, in effect they constitute an incentive to a person to act in accordance with duty only on receipt of payments or, to put it another way, an incentive to act in breach of duty in the absence of continued payments. This proposed linkage between corrupt payments and breach of duty is not to be found in the existing Prevention of Corruption Acts and its introduction would in my view substantially weaken, not improve, the law.</P>
      <P>Section 1 also seeks to extend the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo;, which is already defined in the Prevention of Corruption Acts. The proposed definition is based, as far as I can see, and again with some minor adjustments which are of no consequence, on a provisional proposal of the United Kingdom Law Commission at paragraph 7.17 of its consultation paper. Again, the Law Commission, having considered the matter further and taken into account the comments on its consultation paper, came to the view in its final report that its provisional definition was inadequate and it proposed a significantly different definition. Once again, therefore, we have the extraordinary situation where the House is being asked to give effect in law to a proposal which has been rejected by the very experts who originally formulated it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Opposition has every right to adhere to provisional expert proposals even where the experts make different final recommendations. Surely I am not alone in finding it <Col N="915" /> odd that the proponents of this Bill apparently accepted the provisional proposals of experts but rejected their final, considered recommendations.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains a proposed new offence of bribery which, as far as I can see, is based on a provisional proposal of the Law Commission at paragraph 8.102 of its consultation paper. Deputies will by now not be surprised to hear that the Law Commission rejected this provisional proposal in its final report, preferring a significantly different approach. Leaving aside minor drafting differences which are of no consequence, there is, however, one difference of substance between the provisional recommendation of the Law Commission and section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals not only with the bribery of an agent in connection with the performance of his or her duties, but with the bribery of any person in connection with the performance of his or her duties. There is a reference in the Law Commission's proposal to a person, as distinct from an agent, but only in the context of giving or taking a bribe in connection with the performance by an agent of his or her duties. I am not sure if this distinction escaped the proponents of the Bill, or if they really mean to apply the law on corruption to everyone.</P>
    <P>On balance, I am inclined to think that they did not because if they intended the offence to apply to everyone, clearly there would be no need to refer in the section to agents. In any event, no matter which interpretation is put upon it, it is clear that the proposal has not been properly thought out. Even if the thinking behind the section were clear and the drafting reflected the intention of the Bill's proponents, we should not forget that this proposal is based on a provisional recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, which it has rejected itself.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes a new offence relating to secret commissions. It seems to contain two separate offences and only the first of these, in subsection (1), is described as the offence of receiving a secret commission. Subsection (1) makes it an offence for an agent corruptly to take a payment from another person as an inducement or reward for performing any act in relation to the business of a principal. The offence is limited to receiving a secret commission, as distinct from giving a secret commission and, although the offence is described as relating to secret commissions, it contains no requirement of secrecy. The offence is committed even if payment is openly accepted. I mention these points only out of interest because the conduct described in subsection (1) is in any event fully covered by existing law. It is barely conceivable that subsection (1) was not intended to constitute an offence but was in some way meant as a general description of the offence set out in detail in subsection (2). Even if this were the intention, however, the <Col N="916" /> wording of subsection (1) clearly creates a specific offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) would make it an offence for a person to give a gift or consideration to an agent without the full knowledge or consent of the agent's principal essentially for doing anything in relation to the affairs of the principal. It would also make it an offence for an agent to accept such a gift or consideration for any person other than the principal, although here the knowledge or consent of the principal is irrelevant. It seems this proposed new offence is based on the Australian Secret Commissions Act, 1905. While I make no criticism of this Australian legislation, some might think it paradoxical for an Opposition, which regards Irish legislation on corruption as outdated, to propose reform on the basis of legislation of another State dating from 1905. It is not simply a question of the antiquity of the proposal, with which I do not have a problem but which the Opposition should have a problem if it is to be consistent, but rather of seeing how this proposal might fit into Irish law. The 1905 Act may very well have been relevant to the circumstances of Australia at that time, but at around the same time, a year later, what is still one of the main Irish Acts on corruption was enacted. To transplant one onto the other nearly a century later seems to be questionable. Apart from anything else, this provision would overlap very substantially with existing law.</P>
    <P>Section 4 would create a new offence of abuse of public position. It would apply to any person who offers the public disinterested selections, examinations or opinions in respect of property or services and who dishonestly seeks or obtains a benefit in order to influence those selections, examinations or opinions. It copies a recommendation of the 1995 Australian report of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee on Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences.</P>
    <P>I note that the offence is based on dishonesty rather than corruption. That difference and its implications would need to be explained. The UK law commission considered whether dishonesty ought to be an element in offences of corruption and concluded that it should not be. I am not suggesting that the law commission's opinion is conclusive, but the detailed consideration it gave to this issue would need to be carefully considered. The commission also considered the issue of corruption by persons performing public functions and made recommendations in that regard, recommendations which do not include the Australian proposal, although the commission was aware of it. This issue is one which I am examining in the preparation of my proposals for a Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 would create a new offence of abuse of public office. It also copies a recommendation of the same 1995 Australian report. The offence would apply to any public official who dishonestly <Col N="917" /> exercised any function or influence arising from his or her office, or failed to exercise any such function, or used any information gained from the office to obtain a benefit or cause another person a loss. The scope of the offence is not clear in that the phrase &ldquo;public official&rdquo; is not defined and, as in the previous section, the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; is used. Nevertheless, I accept this is a subject that deserves attention and I will study it in the preparation of my legislative proposals on corruption.</P>
    <P>Section 6 extends the presumption of corruption, which currently applies only to the obtaining of Government contracts, to proceedings for any offence under the Bill. The UK Law Commission studied this question carefully, UK law being the same as Irish law on this point, and not only did it not recommend the extension of the presumption but it recommended its abolition. Any proposal to extend it in our law would need careful consideration not only from a policy point of view but also from the perspective of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Section 7 rules out certain defences to the offence of bribery created by section 2. It is based, with some minor differences, on a proposal of the UK Law Commission in its consultation paper, at paragraph 8.58. It is, however, based on a profoundly mistaken view of the purpose of the law commission's proposal. In making its proposal, the law commission was simply rejecting the idea that certain specified grounds should be a defence to a charge of corruption. Implementing the proposal does not require positive statutory intervention. It merely means that no such defences should be positively provided for. Section 7, therefore, is simply not needed.</P>
    <P>It might be noted that while the law commission originally, in its consultation paper, identified five separate grounds which, in its view, should not be defences to a charge of corruption, it changed its mind on one of the grounds, coming to the view in its final report that the consent of a principal should after all be a defence. The law commission proposed, therefore, that such a statutory defence should be provided for, which is the opposite of what is contained in section 7.</P>
    <P>I have no comments on the remaining two sections of the Bill, which deal with penalties and the short title and I will, therefore, sum up my reaction to the Bill in general. I agree with the proponents of the Bill that corruption is a matter of the utmost importance. I am sure every Member would agree on that. I also agree that the law on corruption would benefit from reform, although I would not like the impression to be given that this House has neglected reform of the law on corruption. Significant changes were made to that law in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and no doubt more could have been done in that Act if it had been thought necessary at the time. The question is whether this Bill is an adequate <Col N="918" /> response to the need for reform. I defy anyone to answer that in the affirmative. The Bill does not even attempt to deal with the main purpose of the proposals I am preparing, which is to make major improvements to our law so as to meet our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Even in the areas it attempts to tackle, it does so partly on the basis of expert provisional recommendations which those very experts have subsequently rejected. If their own provisional recommendations are not sufficient for the UK Law Commission, why should they be sufficient for this House? Other provisions in the Bill are based on a mixture of old law and new untested proposals from another state. Some provisions overlap existing law, other provisions are based on misunderstandings, and others still are unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Members of this House do not demand or expect perfection, and they are glad to be able to contribute to the improvement of a Bill by way of amendment. Members are, however, entitled to expect legislative proposals to at least be adequate, to at least constitute a basis for reform. This Bill does not constitute such a basis. I cannot see how it could be put right even with the most extensive amendment.</P>
    <P>I will shortly put proposals before this House to improve the Prevention of Corruption Acts. Deputies will welcome my proposals as a significant reform of the law on corruption. I will listen carefully and respond positively to any suggestion, from whatever side of the House, for further worthwhile changes. If this Bill provided the basis for the change required I would have wholeheartedly accepted it, but I cannot, for the reasons I outlined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and to a lesser degree, Deputy McCormack were selective and displayed signs of premature amnesia when they outlined alleged acts of impropriety to the House. Tribunals are dealing with these matters and it would be wrong of me to go into any detail on same. I will await the outcome of the tribunals' findings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the old chestnut that the merger of the Department of Justice with the Department of Equality and Law Reform has somehow resulted in less legislation coming before the House, from either Department, I again lay that to rest. In the past two years, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has produced more legislation under my direction than at any time in the history of the State. For example, as regards the performance of the equality and law reform section of the Department, I defy anybody to establish that it does not favourably compare with that under my illustrious predecessor, the former Deputy, Mervyn Taylor. More than one third of the legislation which has been brought before this House in the past two years has emanated from the Department of Justice, Equality <Col N="919" /> and Law Reform. That is a tribute to the staff in the Department and I am pleased to be politically accountable for such major reform in our laws.</P>
    <P>It is untrue, as some have sought to suggest, that in that period there has not been substantial criminal law reform &ndash; there most certainly has been. The Criminal Justice Act which was passed recently is a hallmark in the evolution of the battle against drugs in society. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill represents an assault on one of the most insidious and heinous crimes of all. Other legislation which has been enacted has served to buttress our criminal justice system at a crucial period in its history. Planned legislation is of a revolutionary variety. The new sexual offences Bill which is being prepared will represent the greatest change in the law on sexual offences since the foundation of the State. The new criminal law (fraud offences) Bill which will attempt in a comprehensive way to redefine old crimes, represents the most radical step in the evolution of our criminal law in so far as it relates to dishonesty.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that definitions of larceny here go back to the 1916 Act. Other definitions dealing with such matters as forgery, embezzlement and counterfeiting go back even further. Therefore, the new legislation must clearly reflect modern society and perhaps even more importantly it must be capable of being understood by any man or woman who serves on a jury. Any individual who dishonestly makes a gain or causes a loss will be dealt with in a straightforward way by the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the reforms planned. The list I outlined is by no means exhaustive. However, it is fundamentally unfair of commentators in this House, who must know better, to try to create the illusion that a Department which has never flowered better in its legislative output is doing the opposite. It would be understandable coming from those who do not know any better or do not want to know any better. However, it is a bit rich coming from people who know better. It is clear that the law on corruption is inadequate. If that was not so I would not bother to frame the legislation which is in the process of being drafted.</P>
    <P> In summary, many of our offences relating to fraud are hopelessly outdated which is why they will be changed. By the end of the life of this Government, history will show that the period when this Government was in office was the most revolutionary and radical, in terms of overhauling criminal law, since the foundation of the State. Unfortunately, I cannot accept this Bill because of its inadequacies.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, although from listening to the Minister I am not sure if there is any hope it will get further than Second Stage. I compliment Fine Gael on putting so much effort into an area which is of considerable importance and interest to many people. I wish to outline some of the reasons we will be supporting the Bill and to point out some of its features which we will seek to amend if it is reaches Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been tabled to help politics, public life and business move forward in the healthiest possible way, by increasing transparency and eliminating acts of corruption. The motivation behind the Bill is firmly grounded in the fall-out of the events leading up to the establishment of the tribunals. No doubt, during the run-up to the recent elections, Members will have sensed and will have had communicated to them the level of public disquiet about, and distrust of, our political system. This was referred to by Deputy Flanagan in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>The low voter turnout, which was as little as 26 per cent in some polling stations, is a sad reflection on our modern democratic society. We, as legislators and public representatives, must consider proposing new methods of maximising voter turnout. One such method is to restore trust and confidence in our system. The damage done to the political system by a handful of public representatives, some of them no longer Members of this House, has implications for us all. It is only through the introduction of tough, anti-corruption laws that we can reverse this damage.</P>
      <P>Of course, corruption is not limited to politics. Business, particularly big business, has been tainted by malpractices which have come to the fore in recent times, especially in the banking sector. The Labour Party is supporting this Bill because we believe the overriding motivation behind it is to underline bribery and secret commissions as serious offences that will not be tolerated in public offices or business.</P>
      <P>The motivation of people in influential positions must, above anything, be the public good. The acceptance and giving of bribes to secure personal favours, often to the detriment of others, is not a feature of public life with which I want to be associated. I believe that the majority of Members of this House and the business community would support any measure which would reinforce their integrity.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, this legislation is by no means perfect. As I have already said, in the event of the Bill reaching Committee Stage, my party, following legal advice, will be tabling a series of amendments to it. These are mainly technical amendments and I hope they will help to enhance the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I am slightly put out by the fact that the Bill completely ignores section 38 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, which updated the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1916. Section 9 of this Bill, which addresses the collective citation of the Bill, completely ignores the 1995 Act. I would be interested to know if this was a genuine oversight by the framer of the Bill or if there is an overriding reason for failing to include it. Perhaps Deputy Flanagan will address those points in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, was introduced by my colleague, the former Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, against strong odds and strong opposition at all levels to getting it through the Oireachtas. It amended the anti-corruption legislation to take into account, among other matters, the activities of Ministers and ministerial special advisers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the 1995 Act also redrafted the presumption of corruption, which arises in certain circumstances and which was initially set out in section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1932. The section states: &ldquo;Any money, gift or other consideration received from a person seeking a contract from a Minister shall be deemed to have been received or given corruptly, unless the contrary is proved.&rdquo;  This Bill deals with the presumption of corruption in a similar way. A section of the Bill provides that if a gift was received from a person as part of an inducement to secure a special reward or favour, it is corrupt unless proven otherwise. If my understanding of this section is correct, I must again question why the amending sections of the Ethics in Public Office Act have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>On a more minor point, I would like to see greater definition of some of the terms used in the Bill. The Minister has referred to this. For example, in section 5 I would like to know what precisely constitutes a public official. Nonetheless, despite our concerns, I believe that, through amendments on Committee Stage, we can iron out the technical problems with the Bill in its current form.</P>
    <P>When launching the Bill, Fine Gael pointed out that only one person in the past 13 years has been convicted under our current corruption code. In a sense, this sets corruption apart from any other crime. Corruption, which may drastically influence planning decisions in favour of large developers over the needs of communities, is somehow a lesser crime than one where a petty criminal tries to secure the means to purchase his or her next fix. Corruption in many guises leads to criminal behaviour and helps the black economy to flourish. Despite the fact that members of the public believe that corruption is widespread and, as Deputy Flanagan said, are saying, &ldquo;You are all at it&rdquo; and &ldquo;You are all the same&rdquo;, it is ironic that nobody seems to have been found guilty of cor<Col N="922" /> ruption &ndash; I should say &ldquo;as of yet&rdquo;, until the tribunals complete their inquiries.</P>
    <P>Corruption is predominantly a white collar crime. The fact that only one person has been charged with this offence in the past 13 years raises the question of whether there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. Our prisons are bulging at the seams with convicted heroin addicts who were sentenced because they robbed £30 or £50 for their next fix. I am not saying it is right for them to rob, but why should others who have taken bribes to carry out favours which were not part of their terms of duty be let off the hook, particularly if the action for which they accepted bribes inflicted hurt or damage on others?</P>
    <P>The Bill brings the penalties for the crime of corruption into line with those for other crimes. For example, a fine of £1,500 or a 12 months prison sentence is proposed for summary convictions, which is in line with what is now perceived to be the maximum penalty imposed by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Although I have made some slight criticisms of the Bill, which mainly relate to technical details, I thank Fine Gael for using its Private Members' time to table it. I am surprised the Minister found the Bill so reprehensible that he could not support it or suggest amendments to it, which I would have thought was the purpose of this Private Members' time. In my view, the more we can do to legislate for a fairer and more just society, the better for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Deputy Flanagan's Private Members' Bill which is before the House this evening.</P>
      <P>Corruption and the public belief that corruption exists in business and in public life in Ireland is doing untold damage to public confidence in the institutions of the State and society as a whole. It is right and proper that our legislation be reviewed and updated to ensure that our laws are stringent enough to deal with corruption, bribery and secret commission in any form in which it appears. In this respect this Bill is welcome. It updates our existing laws which date from 1916 in respect of corruption and bribery. As has already been stated many times tonight, the fact that only one person in the State was convicted for corruption in the past 13 years is proof positive that both our legal framework and our enforcement regime are in need of radical overhaul. It is the responsibility of the Oireachtas to ensure that both aspects of the matter are addressed in a forthright manner and that a real assault on corruption, backhanders and sharp practices is undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me dwell for a moment on the subject of enforcement of our laws, particularly as they relate to white collar crime. For most people here, the mention of the word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; conjures <Col N="923" /> up images of sinister gangs involved in the drugs trade, protection rackets or other such criminal behaviour. Our perception of crime and of criminals is heavily reinforced by these images which are also widely disseminated through television and other media.</P>
    <P>However, white collar crime is also prevalent in our society today. In some respects it is more insidious than many so-called ordinary crimes. In much white collar crime it is difficult to point to an individual victim, to a citizen whose rights have been trampled on by those with no regard for the law. Let there be no doubt that white collar crime does create victims, from the unsuccessful job applicant who has been passed over because the selection procedure was rigged to the companies bidding for a contract whose tenders were never given a chance because they did not grease the wheels in the manner to which some people have become accustomed. These people and organisations are victims of white collar crime.</P>
    <P>On a wider level, all citizens of this State, and the State itself, are victims of crimes of this nature. Recent revelations have proved that tax evasion was rife in many businesses in Ireland over the recent past. In the 1980s and early 1990s, while the Government was forced to make drastic cutbacks in public expenditure, cutbacks that often hurt the most vulnerable sector in our society, leading businesses and individuals operated on the basis that the tax laws were an annoying obstacle that could be got around. In many instances there was no connection between the payment of tax and the social services that the State made available to its citizens. The &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; mentality dictated many decisions made in some of the most important boardrooms of this country. This avoidance of tax at a time when thousands of citizens suffered from cutbacks in essential services, was a form of robbery. The victim may not have been as readily identifiable as the elderly lady who is robbed of her handbag on the street, but let there be no doubt that white collar crime of the nature that has gone on here has real victims. People's basic supports were cut back while people who should have paid their fair share flouted the law at every turn.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House clamp down on this type of crime and ensure that the Garda and the relevant authorities have the resources necessary to deal effectively with allegations and investigations.</P>
    <P>The definition and scope of the term &ldquo;bribery&rdquo; has never been defined in Irish law. Judicial interpretations at different stages since the foundation of the State have formed the most reliable basis for interpretation. I welcome the fact that this Bill defines &ldquo;bribery&rdquo; in our primary legislation. Bribery and corruption undermine the basic principles <Col N="924" /> of equality and fair play which should inform all decisions, public and private.</P>
    <P>The recent privatisation of a number of State firms and the increasing liberalisation of a number of important markets, such as telecommunications and electricity, necessitate a review of our corruption laws. Traditionally the legal thrust of our bribery laws has been concentrated in particular on the behaviour of public officials. However, the increasingly open liberalised economy which we are in the process of creating must also be protected against corruption and bribery. Individuals in business who are guilty of nefarious practices must be investigated thoroughly and prosecutions must be brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>In this House, over the past four years in particular, we have spent much time and energy establishing regulatory regimes to ensure that a level playing pitch is in operation for all entrants to our new liberalised markets. This work cannot be undermined by under-the-table payments aimed at gaining a competitive advantage. Our laws defining bribery should apply to those in the public and private sector alike.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in conjunction with a recent report on company law compiled by Mr. Michael McDowell, SC, represent a significant advance in how we deal with white collar crime. The report on company law has at long last drawn the attention of the Government to the widespread flouting of legal requirements passed by this House. In many circles, registration with the Companies Office and the regular filing of company returns were unheard of practices. The new vigour which the McDowell report will engender should put an end to this behaviour and ensure that our business sector complies with the requirement for transparency and openness that the law of the land demands.</P>
    <P>While I support this Bill in principle and look forward to the debate on Committee Stage, it may be valuable to review our laws on corruption and bribery in the wake of the final report from the tribunals which are currently sitting. Ordinary people are outraged by the fact that, despite the amount of wrongdoing which has been uncovered, the main players in these scandals have avoided prosecution in the courts. The fact that the most high profile prosecution to emanate from the beef tribunal was against the journalist who originally broke the story still rankles with me and with many others in this House. In the wake of the tribunal reports, we should undertake a wholesale review of our laws relating to corruption and bribery.</P>
    <P>I note that in section 5 &ndash; the section dealing with abuse of public office &ndash; specific reference is made to an individual who dishonestly &ldquo;uses any information he or she has gained arising out of his or her public office&rdquo;. This section touches on a matter that is much on the minds of people in this House. My colleague, Senator <Col N="925" /> Pat Gallagher, will soon publish a Bill relating to lobbyists which represents a major step forward in establishing a legal framework in which lobbyists can work. Section 5, although its scope is wider than lobbyists, also addresses this and I urge the Government to act on the remarks the Taoiseach made at the end of Question Time last week when he outlined the major issues that need to be tackled in this regard and to look favourably on the Bill soon to be presented by Senator Gallagher.</P>
    <P>We need to update our laws on corruption. Deputy Flanagan's Bill deserves to be given a Second Reading and debated in Committee. I urge the House to accept it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue. Some of us do not realise that community employment schemes make a significant contribution to the development of community life, particularly in areas which have been designated as disadvantaged, such as those which qualify for partnership companies. I am mainly, though not exclusively, concerned with Dublin 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of community employment schemes, however, were capped, with the exception of those which got the opportunity to have &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo;. Some groups which applied for the rate for the job were told that the quota had been used up and they could not, therefore, apply for it. Those over 35 years of age cannot take up part-time job options under these new regulations because they are not allowed a third year. If 28 participants in Dublin 12 were over 35, they would have been normally entitled to second and third years. Now only 10 per cent are entitled to <Col N="926" /> that &ndash; only 2.8 people could be retained as opposed to 28 in the past.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin 12 area the number of previous participants over 35 allowed to participate in the community employment scheme was 587. That has now been capped at 484, a reduction of 103. That area is not large but the schools in it which benefit from the assistance of the community employment schemes and all the other projects will suffer if this is allowed to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The FÁS community employment supervisors network in Dublin 12 is very disturbed by the changes taking place in community employment. The scheme was set in 1993 to get short and long-term unemployed into the workforce. Supervisors were trained accordingly. They were told how important it is to treat the participants with dignity, to build up their self-confidence and improve the quality of their lives, something they have done. I have seen the transformation in people participating in these schemes. Now that the economy is successful, they have been cast aside and we are only dealing with numbers.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to raise eight points by those involved. All their projects, except for those accepted for rate for the job, have been capped. I say those accepted because a number of projects were turned down for this option because the local FÁS office had reached its quota. The supervisors were led to believe at a meeting with FÁS personnel that they would be going for rate for the job. In anticipation they had recruited over 35 long-term unemployed. Now all that has changed and they have to let their over 35s go after one year.</P>
    <P>This group is working in a disadvantaged area, doing very valuable work such as caring for the elderly and those with disabilities and running crèches and playschools. They have been told they will be judged on progress. Many of the participants are lone parents who have never worked outside the home. Because the participants are socially disadvantaged, one or two years is not enough time to prepare them to take up the jobs which had been created.</P>
    <P>There have been various reports such as those by Deloitte &amp; Touche and Conference of Religious of Ireland, but nobody consulted with those on the job. The participants were led to believe that the posts will be cut further next year. These rumours have caused alarm. They also have been led to believe that other disadvantaged areas have been unaffected by these changes. Why is that? Some participants have difficulty in reading and writing, with the resultant fear of training.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer has been given £590,000 in tax and PRSI by these people. They are making a financial as well as a social contribution. We must not deal with this matter like a bull in a china shop. We must take into account the contribution they are making. I hope the Minister will take these concerns into account and act accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is as a transitional programme to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. This year there has been a reduction in the number of places in community employment, from a level approaching 40,000 at end 1998 to an average of 37,500 in 1999. This reduction of 6 per cent reflects in a very modest way the drop in unemployment levels, which are down 65,000 year on year to November 1998. It is also indicative of a strategic shift in supports for unemployed persons away from community employment towards mainstream training programmes, bridging programmes to mainstream training and job clubs. An additional 10,000 places in these areas were provided for in the 1999 Revised Estimates.</P>
      <P>This strategy represents a response to the thrust of the Deloitte &amp; Touche review of community employment. The main elements of that review were to reduce the number of places; improve targeting and progression; limit rollover by participants; have young adults participate in mainstream training rather than community employment; and discontinue community employment within the State sector.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has just completed a round of consultations with the social partners on the restructuring of community employment. Taking these discussions into account, proposals for the restructuring of community employment are currently being finalised. As is standard practice, these proposals will be circulated to relevant Departments for observation prior to being brought to Government. It is anticipated that the restructuring proposals will be implemented on a phased basis over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Within the context of the overall number of places on community employment schemes, FÁS has operational responsibility for project selection and appraisal. Priority is accorded to sponsors who provide good and relevant work experience, training and educational experiences, achieved good progression, including placement results, and have an approved and effective supervisor.</P>
      <P>In addition, a strategic policy focus is applied to projects, having regard to national and local policy objectives. This means that child care and drugs task force projects, for example, are accorded priority. There is also an emphasis on projects which accord with partnership-community employment framework agreement priorities and with local development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to stress that a number of community employment projects have a finite lifetime as opposed to those schemes providing services <Col N="928" /> which are rolled over, and this too will be a criterion applied in any reduction in numbers.</P>
    <P>While the restructuring proposals on community employment, which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends to bring forward, will reflect a number of issues in the Deloitte &amp; Touche review, the full set of recommendations will not be implemented. It is not, for example, proposed to terminate the programme in the statutory sector, including schools.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Water Supply Contamination.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The contamination of the water supply on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, is extremely worrying, and the Minister for Health and Children must take full responsibility for this near catastrophe. I ask him to clarify exactly how this contamination occurred, if it was caused by sewage or farm effluent, whether this has happened before at St. Ita's and what steps he proposes to take to ensure the purity of the water supply in St. Ita's.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 550 very vulnerable residents and patients plus about the same number of staff who, since last Friday, 18 June, have had to make do with tankers of cold water supplied by Fingal County Council. Hot water is not available for baths, laundry or general hygiene use unless the water is boiled. Nurses and care staff must haul water up and down stairs &ndash; in one instance, a three storey building. I understand that it may be at least another four or five days before the problem is rectified. All the water tanks, 25 in all, have to be emptied and sterilised and as yet the source of contamination has not been found. The central heating had to be switched off and no alternative has been provided.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to request the assistance of the Army to help haul the water around the hospital and to set up a temporary system to provide hot water and heating. There are many elderly doubly incontinent patients and they can only be cared for using either cold water or medical wipes. I do not have to be any more graphic, particularly with the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, given his profession, to portray how appallingly difficult it is for staff to look after these patients without running hot water and in cold unheated wards. Why can the work not be completed more quickly? Surely contractors can be hired, if local staff are not available, so the work may be finished. Will the Minister give an assurance that he will provide all the necessary resources to expedite the work to restore the water?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that over the years concerns about the level of maintenance have been expressed by staff and by the St. Joseph's Association for the Mentally Handicapped. Apparently, as maintenance staff reach retirement age, the <Col N="929" /> Eastern Health Board has not been replacing them. Could this policy have anything to do with the current contamination whereby there was insufficient staff to keep close scrutiny on the water tanks, pipes, etc.? It has been stated by the EHB that it was regular routine testing which showed the e.coli contamination. I heard locally that is not the case but that a member of staff reported the matter to the health board when some patients became sick. It may also be the case that the e.coli strain is not the highly dangerous version but I point out that the patients in St. Ita's are very vulnerable, many, as I said, are doubly incontinent and many who have been there for years are elderly and their resistance to infection may well be lower as a result. A number of the staff live on the campus and their quarters are also without water and heat.</P>
    <P>Over the years the staff in St. Ita's have done a tremendous job in very difficult circumstances. During this emergency they are working night and day to minimise the inconvenience and discomfort being caused. I would like the Minister to join me in commending the staff and to assure me that the problem will be solved quickly and that any additional overtime payments required will be sanctioned by the Minister. I also want a commitment from the Minister that the investment now being put into the facilities and services in the complex, both for mentally handicapped and psychiatric patients, which is very welcome, will be continued until all the facilities are brought up to today's modern standards.</P>
    <P>So far it would appear people have not become ill as a result of this contamination but they may still succumb to illnesses in the coming days. We could have been faced with a major catastrophe if the contamination had been of a different strain but, thankfully, we were not. The Minister has been warned by this very close call and it is his responsibility to ensure this does not happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from information received by Fingal County Council that there were indications of slight traces of lead in the water used in the farmyard area of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, the environmental health department of Fingal County Council carried out sampling of the water in the farmyard area on 1 June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 June results revealed that water contamination did not exist except for some slight coliform content in the water. On 15 June further water samples were taken from a number of locations on the hospital campus which indicated faecal contamination in one area of the hospital. The results of the tests were available late in the evening of 16 June. A third phase of water sampling took place very early in the morning of 17 June. Initial readings in respect of these samples became available in the afternoon of 18 June which indicated significant presumptive e.coli <Col N="930" /> contamination of water in one area of the hospital campus. Immediately the contamination came to the notice of hospital management on the 17 June, an urgent notice was issued that water was not to be used for drinking purposes unless previously boiled.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting on Friday evening, 18 June between representatives of the environmental health department, Fingal County Council, hospital staff and Eastern Health Board management, it was decided to shut down the water supply to the hospital to prevent any possibility of ill-health to patients or staff. The chief nursing officers of both the learning disabilities and mental health services of the hospital met representatives of all service areas in the hospital later on Friday evening and it was agreed that the water was not to be used for any purpose and that bottled water was available from the hospital stores.</P>
    <P>On Saturday morning, l9 June, Fingal County Council supplied the hospital with water tanks in ten different locations around the hospital campus. The hospital stores department also remained open throughout the weekend and bottled water was supplied for drinking and making tea and coffee.</P>
    <P>On Sunday, 20 June, representatives of the environmental health department, Fingal County Council and hospital management outlined to staff the procedures that were to be implemented to tackle the water contamination. The main hospital water reservoir in the water tower was being cleaned along with all water storage tanks throughout the hospital. The entire water supply system would then be super chlorinated, tested and, if deemed satisfactory, the supply to the hospital would be restored. This has been an unprecedented occurrence and the Eastern Health Board has acted very swiftly to ensure that patients, staff and visitors to the hospital were not exposed to any risk as a result of the contaminated water supply.</P>
    <P>I am now informed that the hospital water tower has been cleaned and there are several teams working on cleaning the tanks throughout the hospital area. All patients are well and have suffered no ill-health effects due to the water contamination. Medical, nursing and management staff have combined to address this serious incident and additional staff have been brought into the hospital as required.</P>
    <P>Hospital management expect that normal water supplies to the hospital will be resumed by the coming weekend following a comprehensive cleaning and disinfecting of the hospital water supply system. The source of the contamination is currently being actively investigated by the board's environmental health department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I received very disquieting reports from concerned citizens who witnessed first-hand a number of incidents but particularly the one to which I refer where a ballot paper of a voter with an intellectual disability was filled in by a third party while the supposed voter rummaged in a bag apparently unaware of why she was in the polling station. When this incidence was reported to the presiding officer, he was very unclear about what could be done as it seems the procedures are at best vague and at worst totally inadequate to ensure proper supervision and the integrity of the secret ballot is maintained.</P>
      <P>At present a person with a physical disability is allowed the assistance of a companion but the position for a person with an intellectual disability seems very unclear. Nobody would want to disenfranchise a person who wished to vote and knew for whom he wished to vote. However, the presiding officer should determine that the voter has the ballot paper marked in accordance with the voter's wishes. That is a basic requirement. When and how will supervision be improved to ensure that voting by a companion of a person with an intellectual disability is in accordance with the voter's wishes?</P>
      <P>I understand presiding officers have had to make very difficult judgment calls on the capability of voters to exercise their franchise when they present themselves at a polling station. Clearly, this is a very difficult call to make and I call on the Minister to set out a clear procedure to avoid embarrassing situations in a public polling station when a presiding officer is faced with such a difficult decision. Is it not too onerous a task to expect a presiding officer to judge the intellectual ability of a voter on a first impression in a polling station?</P>
      <P>Finally, the portraits of candidates on ballot papers is a very welcome development which I hope will be extended to all elections in future. I suggest this development will help reduce the need for companions to assist voters with literacy problems. The provision of Braille ballot papers would also greatly help in reducing the need for companions to assist voters with visual disabilities. Will the companion arrangement be reviewed once the printing of candidate portraits on all ballot papers becomes standard, which I hope will happen, given that it will radically change the situation for people with literacy problems exercising their vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each election presents us with opportunities to evaluate procedures and introduce improvements. Is the Government setting itself the task of improving procedures for future elections? Other issues arose in the elections which I will not discuss now as I do not have time to do so. For example, the early opening of polling stations was marred by the late arrival of boxes in some areas, <Col N="932" /> resulting in people not being able to vote as early as they thought they could. These people could not wait as they had to go to work and as a result were disenfranchised. Clearly, there is a need to tighten procedures. I hope the recent elections will provide an opportunity to evaluate existing procedures and improve on them in future elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I should first explain that the conduct of an election, including the procedure for voting and the supervision of voting, is a matter for the appropriate returning officer in accordance with electoral law. In relation to the procedure for voting at a polling station, electoral law requires that a person issued with a ballot paper shall go alone into a voting compartment in the polling station and shall secretly record his or her vote on the ballot paper. However, there are exceptions to this requirement and electoral law specifies categories of electors who may be assisted.</P>
      <P>A person who satisfies the presiding officer that he or she is unable to vote due to impairment of his or her eyesight or due to physical incapacity may have his or her ballot paper marked for him or her, on his or her instruction, by a companion, or if he or she wishes by the presiding officer. The companion must be at least 16 years of age, must not be a candidate or an agent of a candidate at the election and may not mark, as a companion, more than two ballot papers at the election.</P>
      <P>An elector who satisfies the presiding officer that he or she is unable to read or write to such an extent that he or she is unable to vote without assistance may have the ballot paper marked for him or her by the presiding officer only. When the presiding officer marks a ballot paper for an elector he or she must do so in the presence of the elector and of the agents; no other person is entitled to be present. In relation to voting by people with mental disability, they must be able to apply for a ballot paper and state their name or address. They may be required to produce evidence of identity, answer questions or make an oath or affirmation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have outlined, there are special arrangements to assist electors with physical disabilities, visual impairment or reading or writing difficulties to exercise their voting rights. However, there is no similar provision for companion voting for persons with a mental disability. In this regard, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not aware of the serious reports of malpractice to which the Deputy referred in his contribution. However, if the Deputy makes the details available to the Minister, he will bring the information to the attention of the relevant <Col N="933" /> returning officer and, if necessary, will have the matter considered in the context of the ongoing review of electoral law in his Department.</P>
    <P>I will also bring to the attention of the Minister the other suggestions made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment. It goes without saying that in the past 40 years or so the population of County Kildare has increased dramatically, having more than doubled. This is evidenced by the fact that County Kildare, once a three seater constituency, has been divided into two three seater constituencies. Likewise, the education sector has increased dramatically in terms of scale and spread throughout the county. What was a very small VEC area of responsibility in the 1960s has become an intricate network of highly sophisticated VEC schools throughout the county, and I refer specifically to north Kildare, my constituency. In this regard it should be noted that with an increase in responsibilities, the number of staff to be administered to and the number of calls to the VEC, there is an obvious strain on the administration centre.</P>
      <P>In the recent past there has been evidence of this strain which has been brought to the attention of the current and previous Ministers. We are now at the stage where industrial action is being taken, which is justifiable on the basis that the number of staff in the VEC service in County Kildare is inadequate to deal with the workload. I ask the Minister to personally intervene and ascertain to what extent he can alleviate the problem with a view to ensuring that the potential hardship to those most likely to be affected is averted. I refer to those who are paid on a weekly basis, namely, cleaners in various schools, part-time staff, be they teachers or administrative staff, and secretaries in schools and VEC headquarters. None of these people will be paid in the current climate unless matters are resolved.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister can offer some resolution to the problem. The matter has been in need of attention for some considerable time, it is not the fault of the current Minister that things have developed in this way. I hope on this occasion that the matter will be finally and satisfactorily resolved from the point of view of all concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter. It gives the Minister an opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the allocation of non-teaching staffing resources to vocational education committees generally, with particular reference to an application for an increased staffing allocation received by County Kildare VEC from IMPACT, the union which represents clerical and administrative staff in the VEC sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The allocation of clerical, administrative and maintenance staff in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme-wide basis and it is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy sanctioned staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. The Deputy will be aware that any case for an increase in staffing has to be approached in the context of Government policy on public service numbers and staffing norms in the VEC sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>County Kildare VEC has made a number of representations to the Department concerning the adequacy of staffing levels in the scheme based on increases in pupil numbers and expansion of programmes.</P>
    <P>Arising from previous claims for an improved grading structure and staffing increase, the Department carried out an examination of the staffing levels in 1995. In addition, the grading structure of the VEC was evaluated by an independent consultant. Arising from these reports, the clerical staff complement for County Kildare VEC was increased from 15.8 to 17.8 posts and a new senior management grade was created in the committee. This allocation was arrived at on the basis that it compared favourably with other schemes of similar size. Further increases in the administrative staffing complement of the VEC have since been approved by the Department to support the ESF and PLC student maintenance grant schemes and the operation of the VTOS and Youthreach programmes.</P>
    <P>In his report on the grading structure to apply in the VEC, the independent consultant recommended that the need for the appointment of an assistant principal officer in the VEC should be reviewed at a later date. The Department has agreed to have this review carried out but IMPACT indicated that this was not acceptable and requested a full review of its structure and threatened industrial action, including an all out strike from Monday last.</P>
    <P>The Department is not opposed in principle to the carrying out of a staffing review in County Kildare. However, the Department has also received similar requests from many other vocational education committees. The Minister wants to ensure that these requests are dealt with in an equitable and timely manner. With that in mind, work is currently under way on the development of an agreed framework for looking at staffing claims generally from the VEC sector. The Department expects to be in a position to finalise the detailed arrangements shortly following discussions with all relevant interests, including staffing and management representatives.</P>
    <P>With regard to the threat of strike action, the Minister is pleased to say that following discussions over the weekend IMPACT has agreed <Col N="935" /> to a deferral of its action and a meeting with the VEC and the Department under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission has been set for tomorrow. The Minister is hopeful that these discussions will address the particular difficulties of County Kildare VEC staff while also allowing for the development of the proposed framework.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to assure the Deputy that he is committed to providing the necessary <Col N="936" /> resources to assist vocational education committees in meeting their obligations within the constraints already outlined. He is confident that the proposed framework will better inform his Department concerning the level of pressures and demands falling to be met by vocational education committees, including County Kildare VEC, so that an appropriate and timely response can be made by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.03 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 June 1999.</P>

      <P>As announced in my press release of 23 April 1999, I have initiated a six month long enforcement campaign in the hotel and catering industry, the objective of which is to secure compliance by employers in that sector with the relevant statutory worker protection requirements affecting their employees. The campaign is currently under way involving the full complement of ten labour inspectors to the virtual exclusion of all their other inspection work.</P>
      <P>There are a number of distinct elements to the campaign. Inspectors are conducting random inspections to investigate employers' records and to interview both employers and employees in relation to the compatibility of the terms, conditions and pay of employees with the relevant applicable legislation. In this process a priority will be to ensure that any irregularities discovered are immediately rectified and that, where relevant, arrears of moneys owing to employees are recovered. Legal proceedings will also be instituted, where appropriate, against offending employers.</P>
      <P>There is an educational-informational dimension to the campaign. This will involve my inspectors in giving information and advice, where necessary, in relation to the requirements of the law on individual components of worker protection entitlements.</P>
      <P>A programme of national and provincial advertisements will be operated in conjunction with and as a complement to the activity of the inspectors. The purpose of these advertisements will be to give a high public profile to the campaign in the hope that due note and timely corrective action will be taken by all non-compliant employers notwithstanding that &ndash; by reason of the very limited resources available to me &ndash; an investigation of each and every employer in the sector is simply not possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 26 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Recent levels of economic and employment growth are at historically very high levels. There are now more than 1.5 million people at work, more than at any time in the history of the State. Since this Government has come to office the live register has fallen to its lowest level in 16 years. The unemployment rate at 6.4 per cent is less than half the rate of five years ago. The rate of labour force growth is also significant. Demographic factors including a move towards net inward migration all reveal the dynamics of our labour market.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the economic fundamentals are in place for continuing economic and employment growth. I have this week launched the most recent, 1999 national employment action plan.</P>
      <P>The overriding target in the 1999 action plan is to reduce unemployment to 5 per cent and long-term unemployment to 2 per cent, by the end of year 2000. Key strategic goals under the action plan are to mobilise labour supply by tapping into potential pools of labour, to enhance the quality of labour supply through investment in education and training, to strengthen the preventative element in the employment strategy, to continue the drive to re-integrate long-term unemployed into the open labour market, to support an increase in female labour force participation and to strengthen employment opportunities in new growth sectors.</P>
      <P>The very successful implementation of the supports available to young unemployed under last year's action plan are being extended to adult unemployed under commitments entered into in the 1999 plan. These policies will be balanced with a continuation of the drive to re-integrate into the open labour market those who are long-term unemployed or otherwise excluded.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 79 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the outcomes of supports under the employment action plan are reproduced in monthly progress reports which are available in the Dáil Library. Monthly report No. 7 provides the details in respect of the outcomes for young unemployed persons referred for action plan supports in the period to end April 1999.</P>
      <P>Of the cumulative total of 7,518 young persons referred in the period to end March 1999, the position is that by end April 1999, 60 per cent had left the live register and nearly 70 per cent of these had left for identified positive reasons &ndash; to enter employment, a FÁS programme or return to education. Of those people interviewed by FÁS, 60 per cent had left the live register. Of the remainder, approximately 5 per cent were referred to training programmes, 15 per cent continued with active FÁS supports and in the remainder of cases persons had either dropped out of the support process or were not progression-ready. The report shows that over 1,800 young persons were identified as having entered employment.</P>
      <P>Full occupational details are available only for those placed directly by FÁS. This shows that 32 per cent of persons were in semi-skilled manual occupations and a further 18 per cent and 17 per cent respectively, in clerical or administrative, and unskilled occupations. An equal proportion of 8 per cent in each case were in skilled manual and catering occupations.</P>
      <P>Many of those referred under the action plan have entered employment only in the recent past, so it is early to attempt to assess the durability of their jobs. However, an initial analysis undertaken by FÁS suggests that the level of job retention is high, at least over the first months after entry to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, I am very pleased with the way the action plan is progressing. In addition, we have extended the process since 1 May to the 25 to 34 year age group reaching 12 months unemploy<Col N="940" /> ment and I am confident that it too will have positive outcomes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The Government through Partnership 2000 and through the work of the national centre for partnership, encourages and supports partnership at the level of individual enterprises. An extensive range of employee participation structures already exists as well as a number of measures which provide for information and consultation of employees. However, a new concept of partnership which promotes and facilitates employee share participation could be an important factor in promoting healthy competitive enterprise structures in this country.</P>
      <P>I want Irish business to adopt a more open and imaginative attitude to gain-sharing with their workers. Many of our big companies have employee share ownership schemes in operation. They recognise that their workers are part of the team but we also need to promote such schemes at the level of small businesses.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has proposed a Council Directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community. My Department will consult with the social partners and the text of the proposed Directive is currently being examined in preparation for the consultation process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Job initiative participants have access to three years temporary employment. Budget 99 added an additional 875 places to job initiative provision, bringing the total number of places available to 2,875.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned Deloitte &amp; Touche to review the programme as follows: in the light of labour market changes since the inception of the job initiative programme to revisit the assumptions underlying the targeted groups and provide comment and analysis on whether job initiative remains an appropriate intervention in respect of each of these groups; to consider if the programme is successful in meeting its objectives and indicate how it might be improved or better targeted, and assess if the programme provides value for money to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I expect a report from Deloitte &amp; Touche in early July. In parallel, my Department has been consulting with job initiative stakeholders and this process, too, will help inform future policy. The issue of a further extension for the current participants has also been raised with me but I do not wish to make decisions until I have the evaluation.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, with regard to those persons completing their three year term on the job initiative later this year my Department is initiating discussions with FÁS and relevant local employment service networks in order to set in place appropriate responses to help individuals take up jobs or access training.</P>

      <P>As previously indicated, I have submitted proposals to Government for the introduction of new legislation in respect of the work permit scheme. While it is my intention that the new legislation should reflect the need for a flexible scheme, having regard, in particular, to skill shortages in the Irish economy, I have no plans to alter the position whereby the permits are made available to employers in respect of the employment by them of employees with specific skills. The permits are not issued directly to the employees concerned.</P>

The only stipulation on the part of FÁS is that individuals should be eligible to participate but whether that eligibility is derived from being long-term unemployed or on foot of an NRB referral is immaterial. FÁS can and does refer eligible persons to sponsors for consideration but within the constraints of eligibility and availability of places the sponsor selects the participant.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answers to Parliamentary Question Nos. 116 and 117 of Tuesday, 15 June 1999, concerning Ireland's participation in the pan-European EUREKA programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I outlined in my answer, I have asked <Col N="943" /> Enterprise Ireland, having regard to its strategic remit for company development and in formulating its plans for post-1999 funding for research, technology and innovation, to examine the best way to use the EUREKA programme, in the context of the preparation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>I will represent Ireland at the EUREKA ministerial conference in Istanbul on 29 June 1999. The principal item on the agenda is a debate on EUREKA's strategic review and its implementation. During this debate, I will, on behalf of Ireland, support the relaunch of EUREKA and will outline our proposals aimed at raising Ireland's profile in EUREKA over the coming years. These actions will include the continuation of funding to Irish involvement in EUREKA projects through the in-company research, technology and innovation initiative administered by Enterprise Ireland, with preference being given to collaborative projects; encouraging companies to apply for Enterprise Ireland's feasibility study grants scheme in order to explore opportunities, in collaborative research and development, including EUREKA; the development of a streamlined travel and subsistence funding scheme to encourage companies to send staff to EUREKA brokerage events abroad; the organisation of research and development brokerage events in Ireland; and engaging in a sustained promotional campaign, directed at those companies most likely to consider taking up opportunities to collaborate in research and development through organisations such as EUREKA.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the proposed activities listed above provide ample evidence of Irelands support for the relaunch of the EUREKA programme.</P>

      <P>The date of 31 December 1999 has been declared a public holiday, in recognition of the uniqueness of the occasion in all of our lifetimes. There are, however, sectors where it may be necessary for employees to attend work on 31 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that in certain industrial sectors, such as the hotel and catering sector and the information technology and related sectors, there will be a requirement for a large number of employees to be present at their places of work on this special day. In the public sector, indications from the Garda and the health services and others engaged in essential services, are that the <Col N="944" /> occasion will result in increased labour requirements for the millennium weekend.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements for occasions such as the New Year's Eve holiday are in the normal course of industrial relations, matters to be addressed through negotiation between employers and employees involved, or their representatives.</P>
    <P>Workers have minimum statutory rights and entitlements under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, in relation to work on public holidays and these must be fully respected. It is of particular importance, in relation to the occasion in question, that attention should be paid to such matters as maximum hours of work, hours of rest, and night work. Furthermore, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 prohibits the employment of 16-17 year olds beyond 10 p.m. as a matter of health and safety.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it appropriate for me to provide detailed guidelines for agreements on pay and conditions for millennium work, other than to encourage the parties concerned to work together to ensure that 31 December will be a good occasion for everybody.</P>

      <P>Further to the agreement between the State and ICI to seek a joint sale of 100 per cent of Irish Fertilizer Industries, an information memorandum was issued to interested parties in early March. Two proposals were received by the closing date of 26 March.</P>
      <P>Following clarification and evaluation of the two indicative offers received, the shareholders are of the view that neither offer presented a sufficiently strong basis for proceeding further with the joint sale of IFI. However, a new potential purchaser has recently indicated an interest and this is currently being pursued.</P>
      <P>Once the position regarding this new expression of interest has been clarified and any indicative offer evaluated, the shareholders will decide on whether a joint sale could be progressed with this third party. Should this not prove possible, the shareholders can explore the options remaining in relation to ownership, which include abandoning the sale process altogether or, at any rate, postponing the process for a period or examining the possibility of a unilateral sale of the State 51 per cent shareholding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group, established by my predecessor, published a discussion document on the newspaper sector on 3 March 1999. I had asked the group to take account of and advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the commission on the newspaper industry dealing with <Col N="947" /> competition issues. The recommendations concern the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers, an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
    <P>The competition and mergers review group invited comments on its document by 30 April 1999.</P>
    <P>This issue forms but one part of the overall work of the review group. In July 1998 the review group published a discussion document on mergers and work continues on their wider consideration of competition policy. When the review group has assimilated and considered all the comments of the public and interested parties it expects to submit its final report and recommendations to me later this year.</P>

      <P>My Department's work in examining the books and documents of six companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, is substantially completed, and a number of reports are now being prepared by the authorised officer. I expect to receive final reports on many of these investigations over the summer period.  The companies involved are Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Celtic Helicopters Limited, Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Kentford Securities Limited.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have appointed an authorised officer to a further three companies. In the cases of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited, I am awaiting the outcome of High Court judicial review proceedings of my decision. In relation to College Trustees Limited, I hope that the officer will be given the books and documents that he has specified in the near future. It is not possible to speculate at present as to when these three reports might be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, I am precluded from publishing information relating to a company which has been obtained under section 19 of the Act, except with the prior written consent of the company concerned. In the case of the two section 19 reports which have <Col N="948" /> been completed, namely Faxhill Homes Limited and Garuda Limited, I do not have any authority to publish these reports. However, I have used my powers under section 21 to refer these reports to the DPP, the Minister for Finance, certain authorised officers of the Minister in the Revenue Commissioners and the authorised officer to Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. I will be considering my options under section 21 as I receive each completed report.</P>
    <P>While the inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited were initiated at my request under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, they are proceeding under the auspices of the High Court. While the inspectors appointed by the court have filed a number of interim reports since their appointment, I expect that it will be some time yet before they will be ready to submit their final report to the High Court. It will be a matter for the High Court to determine in due course whether and to what extent this report will be published.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 77, 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>A number of recent reports have suggested that emerging skills and labour shortages could potentially restrict the growth of the Irish economy over the coming years. As part of a response to addressing the skills needs of the economy, FÁS has launched a campaign to attract overseas workers to Ireland. The campaign is focused on highlighting the job opportunities available in certain key sectors which are experiencing the most acute skills shortages at present.</P>
      <P>FÁS's objective is to build up a database of over 10,000 suitably qualified jobseekers who are interested in working in Ireland. The campaign will be conducted in the UK, Germany, France, the Benelux countries, the USA and Canada and is aimed at Irish nationals and other EU citizens.</P>
      <P>FÁS will facilitate the matching of these jobseekers with Irish-based firms seeking to carry out recruitment. FÁS is not offering any inducements, allowances or other financial assistance to encourage people to work in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The FÁS campaign is just one approach to addressing the emerging skills shortages in the economy. I am aware of the ESRI's comments on the campaign and I appreciate that there may be a concern that attracting additional workers to Ireland may exacerbate current difficulties in areas such as housing. I am also aware that it can be argued that the consequences of acting to address skills shortages may outweigh these concerns in terms of the potential to continue to promote economic growth and improved living standards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The draft life assurance disclosure regulations are currently undergoing legal drafting in the parliamentary draftsman's office. They will be based on a specific enabling provision in the Insurance Bill, 1999, which is due to be published later this year. I would like again to re-assure the House that extensive consultations have been held by our Department with all of the interested parties and representative bodies in regard to all aspects of the draft regulations. All of the interests concerned, including insurance brokers' representative bodies, have been given ample opportunity to furnish submissions and to seek clarification and modification, as appropriate, of the proposed regulations. Similarly, the Society of Actuaries has consulted widely in relation to the formulation and content of the accompanying actuarial guidance notes and submissions have been made to the society by insurance brokers' representatives in relation to particular aspects of the guidance notes. I have asked the society, in consultation with our officials, to consider all submissions from the point of view of the maintenance and indeed the strengthening of the equivalence concept, as between the various life assurance distribution channels and the creation of a level playing field, as far as is practicable, between providers of life assurance products.</P>
      <P>Given the extensive consultations that have already taken place and the further on-going consultations, I would urge Deputies to allow due process to prevail in order for these consultations to proceed to finality as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Matters of detail in relation to specific provisions of the regulations, can be raised and dealt with when the Bill comes before the House for its examination, when every opportunity will be given for debating the general scope and content of the legislation before it is enacted.</P>

      <P>Last year I asked IDA Ireland to produce proposals to encourage foreign companies located in Ireland to employ people with disabilities. As a result of the IDA's consultations with a number of its client compan<Col N="951" /> ies, 11 multinationals agreed to participate in a pilot programme. The programme will consider strategies which can be put in place to encourage the employment of disabled people. The programme began in July 1998 and will be completed in December 1999.</P>
      <P>As a result of the experiences which will be gained during the lifetime of the IDA pilot project, I hope the programme can be substantially opened up to a much wider group of companies throughout the country and to a greater number of disabled people. My Department's other agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards, will have a role to play in widening the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In earlier replies to similar questions on this issue I detailed the requirements imposed on employers by the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, and how the Act seeks to protect the welfare of children, persons under 16 years of age, and young persons, 17 and 18 year olds. The Act seeks to protect the welfare of young persons in the workplace by requiring employers to keep wages and employment records detailing the hours of work of any such young persons, rest intervals etc. The Act also lays down specific limits as to the hours that can be worked by young persons and prohibits the employment of persons under 18 in late night work.</P>
      <P>The Act is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. Inspections of employers records are carried out based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Act and as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Act can be detected by close examination of these records. Inspections take place during normal office hours as the majority of employers carry on business during these hours. Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur, a follow-up inspection is usually carried out after a suitable lapse of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work in relation to the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes most efficient use of the enforcement resources available to me. A comprehensive, six month long enforcement campaign commenced by the labour inspectorate in April and focusing on the catering sector nationwide is continuing. It is expected that 1,000 cross legislation inspections will be carried out in the course of this campaign, particular attention being paid to compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken to enforce the 1996 Act with a view to safeguarding the rights of young persons in the workplace. I am conscious of the concerns expressed by various groups in relation to the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons and would urge anyone with information in relation to breaches of the Act to notify the employment rights division of such breaches. I am confident that all such reported breaches will be dealt with expeditiously and that every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with this and indeed any other employment rights legislation.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's question refers to the special working group on a personal injuries tribunal, chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley. In its first report, which was published in May 1997, the special working group set out two alternative structures for a mediation board for occupational injury claims &ndash; the first to operate within the courts system, and the alternative mediation structure to be established on a greenfield basis outside the ambit of the courts system and operating initially on a two year pilot basis. A majority of the working group had reservations about the cost effectiveness of a greenfield mediation board and recommended a mediation system to be established within the courts system, having regard to assurances given to it about the rapid pace and scale of the ongoing reform of court procedures and elimination of delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuing the special working group's recommendation our Department has been advised that the question of establishing a claims mediation process within the courts would be a matter to be <Col N="953" /> pursued with the new courts services board, when established.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the special working group is currently engaged in research into personal injury compensation systems in operation in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and the USA, in the areas of occupational injuries and motor accident injuries. The special working groups consideration of the results of this research and its relevance to the possible improvement of the systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland will, of necessity, involve a re-appraisal of the recommendations in its first report for a claims mediation system. The group is aiming to complete and submit its final report later this year.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the new code is to inform consumers by providing for transparency in the pricing of goods and services during the changeover from the pound to the euro and to assist consumers, in a practical way, to become familiar with pricing in the new currency. The code is designed for retailers and other suppliers of goods and services. Among its features is a strict rule on conversion from Irish pound prices to euros &ndash; the six digit conversion rate of 1 euro = 0.787564 &ndash; must always be used.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the extensive work done by business organisations in bringing forward other codes to meet specific circumstances and from the excellent co-operation received by my Department in preparing the national code, that there is a clear determination on the part of industry not to take advantage of the changeover process to exploit consumers.</P>

      <P>The Donegal employment initiative, which I set up on 16 September 1998, has made considerable progress to date. Since its establishment, the task force has pursued its work through a number of sub-committees which addressed a variety of issues, including the conduct of consultations with employees and management representatives at the various Fruit of the Loom plants on the provision of advice and support to redundant workers and also consideration of submissions made by interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> The work of the task force is now well advanced and I understand that a report on its progress is being finalised for presentation to me shortly. I propose to bring the report before Government in due course.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies, who form part of the task force, have undertaken an intensive promotional campaign of the county and as a result, on 4 May 1999, I announced the creation of 226 new jobs for Donegal which marks the beginning of progress for the area. Some 116 of these jobs are for Letterkenny with the balance being located between Killybegs, Lifford and Greencastle. A number of companies are in discussions with IDA Ireland's north west regional office regarding further new projects.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also actively working with the various bodies represented on the task force to minimise the impact of loss of employment in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, the Government agreed in principle to set up a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector and established an implementation group to prepare recommendations for the basis on which the new authority should be structured and operate.</P>
      <P>The report was submitted to me and, concurrently, to the Minister for Finance on 19 May 1999. Consideration is being given at present in both our Departments to the numerous proposals contained in the report which would have a significant impact on the financial services industry and its customers. The Minister for Finance and I are anxious to ensure that Ireland should have a financial regulatory system of the highest quality and international standing which will be of mutual benefit to this important industry and the wide range of clients that it serves.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to supporting the development of the indigenous sector and that commitment was given new impetus by the establishment, in July 1998, of Enterprise Ireland which combines together, in a one stop-shop, the resources of the former Irish Trade Board, Forbairt and the in-company training division of FÁS.</P>
      <P>In line with its mandate, Enterprise Ireland concentrates on helping and supporting client companies to achieve sustainable competitive advantage leading to growth in profitable sales, exports and employment. The policy I set it is to deliver structured and co-ordinated responses to the business needs of clients as identified by them.</P>
      <P>In its recently launched business strategy, Enterprise Ireland has set ambitious performance targets which will lead to a bigger, more productive, internationally competitive and world class indigenous sector. The long-term target is to double sales within ten years with attendant increases in exports and employment.</P>
      <P>As regards the development of small businesses, the Government decided last September that with effect from 1 January 2000, the local enterprise function will be centralised in the county enterprise boards. This will provide a single local point of contact and support for the establishment and development of small businesses. Through these initiatives the Government will play its part in supporting the indigenous sector. Furthermore, investments under the next national plan will be heavily focused on areas such as improving our infrastructure and our human resources which are so essential to the successful development of industry.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the banana dispute. On 6 April 1999, a WTO panel ruled that the EU revised banana import regime is non-WTO compatible. The panel assessed the damage to US interests at $191 million, which is <Col N="957" /> less than half the amount of sanctions threatened by the US. On 9 April, the US published a revised hit-list of European products to reflect the panel's findings, which would be subject to 100 per cent tariffs. Both my Department and I are continuing to monitor the impact of these sanctions on Irish exporters. Some products of importance to Irish exporters which featured on the US preliminary list, including greeting cards, chandeliers and pig meat, are no longer affected, and the sanctions now have no significant impact on Irish trade or employment. There are ongoing discussions within the EU and also between the EU Commission and the US, with a view to resolving the dispute. Ireland is very active in these discussions. We support a WTO compatible resolution of the dispute.</P>

      <P>The Fruit of the Loom plants based in Malin, Milford, Raphoe and Buncrana remain open on a temporary basis despite the announcements regarding an earlier timetable for their closure and the loss of additional jobs at Ballymacarry, Buncrana. Approximately 770 people were formally made redundant at the end of April 1999 when the Fruit of the Loom plants at Malin, Milford and Raphoe were due to close. The redundancy payments were made at that time. The affected employees were then offered temporary employment on a week to week basis. Many of them accepted this offer and are still employed.</P>
      <P>There are currently 1,991 workers employed at all four plants in County Donegal. The most likely position is that all of the redundant employees on temporary contracts will be laid off at some stage in July. This will result in the closure of Malin Head and Milford and also the cessation of T-shirt production at Raphoe. Fleece production will continue at Raphoe until the end of September 1999. In anticipation of the job losses in Fruit of the Loom, IDA Ireland over recent months intensified its promotional programme of County Donegal, in close association with the Donegal Employment Initiative.</P>
      <P>The extensions to the closure dates originally announced by Fruit of the Loom have significantly affected the initial plans prepared by the Donegal Employment Initiative for training programmes to be provided in response to the specified requests of the redundant workers. The redundant employees on temporary contracts have all been advised that they will have the same opportunity to avail of these training programmes when the plant closures eventually take effect.</P>

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the primary duty for ensuring the <Col N="959" /> health and safety of employees at work, including employees working in the aviation industry, rests with their employer. The Health and Safety Authority is the national body charged with overall responsibility under the 1989 Act for the promotion of occupational safety and health and for the administration and enforcement of relevant statutory provisions on safety and health. Compliance with occupational health and safety law is a day-to-day matter for the authority.</P>
      <P>The role of the authority in relation to the aviation industry centres on all ground operations, with a more limited role when aircraft are under the control of air crew.

The Health and Safety Authority, as part of its ongoing inspection programme, inspects workplaces in the aviation industry and takes enforcement action as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I published the final report of the interdepartmental group on implementation of a national minimum wage today. The group sets out detailed recommendations for the implementation of the national minimum wage. The group recommends that the date for implementation should be 1 April 2000 for all sectors of the economy. Other recommendations cover the definition of working time, pay reference period, reckonable pay, under 18 rate, job entrants and certified training rate, repercussive claims, firms in financial difficulty, uprating mechanism, the interaction with joint labour committees and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The group's report includes the impact study undertaken for the group by the ESRI. The ESRI study concludes that approximately 163,000 employees will benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage. Over half of these beneficiaries will be women and over 40 per cent will be persons aged under 25. Approximately 80,000 workers will get an increase of at least £1 per hour.</P>
      <P>The ESRI study estimates that the impact of the introduction on 1 April 2000 of the national minimum wage on the national wage bill will be an increase of 1.6 per cent of total gross earnings. This is much lower than the figure of 4 per cent estimated by the National Minimum Wage Commission, in its report last year, mainly due to wage growth between 1997 and the year 2000.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by the group that the possibility of repercussive claims should be curtailed. Such claims could seriously erode the competitiveness of the economy and employment levels. I will shortly be in a position to finalise my proposals for the necessary legislation following consideration of this report and submissions received from interested parties on it.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with workplace health and safety. It is detailed legislation which clearly sets out the responsibilities which both employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment. The Act applies to all places of work and covers all employers, employees and the self-employed. The 1989 Act places the primary duty of care for the safety, health and welfare at work of employees on the employer in the first instance. This applies to all workplace health and safety matters including such issues as workplace stress, violence and bullying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 12 of the 1989 Act, every employer is obliged to prepare a written safety statement. This statement should be based on an <Col N="962" /> identification of the hazards, and an assessment of the risks, to safety and health at the place of work. The statement should also specify the manner in which the safety, health and welfare of workers is to be secured. The Health and Safety Authority encourages all employers to use the process of preparing a safety statement to examine both the physical and psychological risks to workers, and to ensure that the workplace is structured and managed in such a way so as to ensure that workers are not placed under extreme levels of stress which may have a negative or detrimental effect on their physical and psychological well-being. The emphasis is on the management of workplaces in a way so as to prevent unnecessary stress.</P>
    <P>The authority has produced a booklet on the prevention of stress at work and it is intended that this will be revised during the current year. A separate booklet on bullying at work is also available from the authority and I am considering further initiatives in this area at present. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The recent survey undertaken by Enterprise Ireland and that undertaken by the Small Firms Association confirm that awareness of the Year 2000 computer problem is very high and that many companies now have taken steps to pursue the issue. A high proportion have commenced some planning and have assigned a senior employee to take responsibility within their organisations. Despite this, the level of remedial action is still disappointing. This is a concern to all of us involved in the Business Awareness Campaign.</P>
      <P>In regard to the risks facing the economy, there are many positive developments. The State services, the utilities and the bigger companies in all sectors, throughout the economy are very far advanced in remedial programmes. This progress has been recognised in an international survey which places Ireland among the small number of countries in the top rank of compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is the smaller businesses who have been slow to respond, despite all the efforts to ensure that they take action to become compliant. The information campaign of Enterprise Ireland is now concentrating on these sectors. To <Col N="964" /> ensure continued Government action on the year 2000 computer problem, further funds have been allocated to Enterprise Ireland towards the cost of their information campaign and their efforts are being focused on those companies most at risk. Full details of this campaign were given in my reply to Questions Nos. 8334/99 and 8335/99 of 24 March 1999.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions previously, it is up to individual businesses to take the necessary steps to ensure that their business activities can continue normally after the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I travelled to Brussels to represent Ireland at the EU Council of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers on 25 May 1999. I was taken ill that morning and the Irish Deputy Permanent Representative deputised for me at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political agreement was reached at that meeting on three separate directive proposals, as follows, concerning the organisation of working time: (a) a proposal for a Council directive amending directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that directive; (b) a proposal for a Council directive concerning the agreement on the organisation of working time of seafarers concluded by the European Community Shipowners Association (ECSA) and the Federation of Transport Workers Unions in the European Union (FST); and (c) a proposal for a Council <Col N="965" /> directive concerning the enforcement of seafarers hours of work on board ships using Community ports. Ireland supported all three proposals.</P>
    <P>The proposal at (a) envisages a phased introduction of a 48-hour (average) maximum working week for doctors in training, 48 hours being the maximum permitted weekly working hours applicable to workers generally under the EU working time programme, which is subject to a transitional phasing arrangement under which: a 60-hour limit will apply for the first three years after implementation of the directive; a 56-hour limit will apply for the second three years after implementation of the directive; anda 52-hour limit will apply for the third three years after implementation of the directive.</P>
    <P>A four year limit, dating from adoption of the directive, has been agreed by the Council as the timeframe within which member states will have to implement the directive within their territories.</P>

      <P>I met the president and chief executive of the Stock Exchange on 27 May last. The disclosure of directors pay and remuneration in listed companies was one of the subjects we discussed. I have indicated to them that full disclosure of remuneration of each named director is a desirable development. It is in the best interests of all the members of a company that the annual reports of Irish registered Irish listed companies show the individual remuneration packages paid to directors. I have already indicated that I would prefer to see the Stock Exchange's rules on disclosure in the area being revised voluntarily rather than dealing with it through legislation.</P>
      <P>The exchange has informed me that it is currently engaged in assessing responses from investors, companies and other relevant bodies concerning the disclosure of directors pay and remuneration. Following this consultation process, I have agreed to meet the exchange in the early autumn to progress the matter.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to her responsibilities under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (S.I. No. 24 of 1995), the Director of Consumer Affairs is working in consultation with the representative organisations of credit institutions in order to draw up a code of practice on transparency in relation to consumer credit charges, to which the member credit institutions of those organisations will adhere on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed code is to bring about improved transparency of interest, fees and charges by credit institutions in relation to consumer credit products or services, over and above the existing statutory and voluntary provisions, in order to more fully meet the needs of consumers, as personal customers of those institutions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the commencement date for the proposed code is now effectively the main issue outstanding in the consultative process being led by the Director of Consumer Affairs. In that connection, I believe the director is currently exploring avenues for resolving information technology implications associated with early introduction of the code without jeopardising the Y2K preparations by credit institutions. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my full support for the director's initiative in bringing forward the proposed code. I would urge credit institutions and their representative organisations to join their best efforts with those of the director in order to overcome the final hurdles in reaching agreement on the code.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the regulations for the labelling of bacon and bacon products on sale in this country comply with EU legislation in this area. The European Communities (Labelling, Presentations and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982 (as amended), which implement Directive 79/112/EEC (as amended) on the labelling, advertising and presentation of foodstuffs, provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that most pre-packaged foods, including bacon products, must include certain information, including the following, on the label: the name of the food; the name or business name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller established within the EU; and the country of origin if its absence might mislead to a material degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sufficient under the regulations to provide the name or business name and address of the manufacturer or the packer or the seller, without <Col N="967" /> specifying to which of the three this information relates. The regulations would not permit a requirement to identify products as Irish unless the absence of such identification might mislead consumers to a material degree. My Department and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, which enforces the food labelling regulations, are currently looking at certain issues relating to the interpretation of the regulations to ensure that the information provided to consumers, in accordance with the regulations, does not mislead them regarding the origin of products.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation. I am informed by the authority that there were 22 fatalities in the construction sector in 1998, in addition to seven fatalities in other sectors from construction-related activities. Some 579 non-fatal construction-related accidents were reported to the authority in 1998. For the first three months of this year three fatal accidents and 117 non-fatal accidents in the construction sector were reported to the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a high level of both trade union and employer representation and participation in all the activities of the authority, particularly in relation to the construction sector. The authority has a tripartite board with equal representation from trade union and employer sides, while the authority's construction safety advisory committee is also composed of representatives of both sides of industry. The construction action programme, which is designed to address the specific issues surrounding health and safety in the construction sector, was drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority after consultation with both sides of industry. In addition, the authority continues to meet regularly with both trade union and employer groups as part of the drive to improve the safety culture of the construction sector at all levels. There are, therefore, many opportunities for both the trade unions and the employer organisations to express their concerns <Col N="968" /> and their views, both formally and informally, to the authority.</P>
    <P>Recent developments to improve safety standards in the construction sector include the launch of a code of practice on scaffolding. This code of practice provides recommendations and practical guidance on all aspects of working with scaffolds. The code of practice was the result of a joint initiative involving the Authority, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Construction Industry Federation. A safety training video focusing on scaffolding was also launched at the same time. This video was produced in conjunction with FÁS. Other work which is continuing under the construction action programme includes targeted inspections of construction sites, safety in working with fragile roofs, training of workers, safety representation and the role of clients.</P>
    <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally sound legislation which provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety. It is enforced in a targeted manner by the Health and Safety Authority and is complemented by the commitment and activities of the social partners. It is through this continued commitment from all sides that we can bring about real improvement in safety standards.</P>

      <P>The announcement by ThermoDisk of the closure of their Limerick plant with effect from 1 July 1999, which will result in the loss of 69 jobs, is regrettable. The closure of the plant is due to excess global capacity. However, as I said in my statement on 31 May 1999, Limerick is experiencing buoyant jobs growth at present. I recently announced a project for Modus Media which will create 100 jobs over the next year in a customer solutions centre. Other companies such as Dell, Hadco Corporation and Beacon Integrated Systems are recruiting at present and are looking for a wide range of skills.</P>
      <P>This week, FÁS will meet the ThermoDisk employees to undertake skills profiles and assess training requirements. Everything possible will be done by FÁS to enhance the prospects of the workforce for re-employment. In addition, the Limerick area is regarded as an attractive location for overseas mobile investment and the development agencies will continue to market it aggressively.</P>

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, provides for statutory rights for employees in respect of rest, maximum working time and holidays. The Act stipulates a maximum average working week of 48 hours for employees averaged over four months generally, over six months <Col N="974" /> for employees whose work is subject to seasonality, a foreseeable surge in activity or where the work involves ensuring continuity of service or production, and over 12 months if there is a collective agreement in place approved by the Labour Court. There is, however, a transitional arrangement under the Act whereby an employee may work up to an average of 55 hours a week in the period 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2000 provided the employee has agreed to those extended hours and provided the agreement has been approved by the Labour Court. If the employee is a member of a trade union or if his/her employment is represented by a trade union the employee must sign the agreement to work the extended hours through the trade <Col N="975" /> union. If the employee is not a member of a trade union or no trade union exists in the place of employment the employee must sign an individual agreement to work the extra hours.</P>
      <P>Doctors in training are excluded from the protection of the maximum working hours provisions in the Organization of Working Time Act, 1997. However, there are EU proposals for a directive which will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for maximum weekly working hours for doctors in training. The Labour and Social Affairs Council of Ministers agreed on 25 May 1999 on a proposed directive whereby there would be a nine year transition period from the end of a four year implementation period before a 48 hour working week would apply to doctors in training. The transition period would be broken down into three stages with successive reductions in the working week : 60 hours for the first three years, 56 hours for next three years and 52 hours for the remaining three years.</P>
      <P>What was agreed at the council meeting now goes to the European Parliament for consideration. The eventual final content of the directive is a matter for negotiation between the Council and the Parliament. The Minister for Health and Children, has indicated that he does not believe that we need to await the final outcome of the EU's deliberations on the draft directive to begin to put in place the preparatory process required to implement the primary provisions of the legislation. In that regard he regards it as necessary to establish the facts on the ground. Accordingly, it has been proposed following a recent meeting between representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Health Services Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation that a study should be undertaken which would look at the hours worked by non-consultant hospital doctors. When the findings of the study and the outcome of the medical manpower forums deliberations are available, it is intended to reach agreement on how to reduce the NCHD working hours in a manner that benefits doctors and patients.</P>

      <P>In 1997 the Government established a business education and training partnership to develop national strategies to tackle the issues of skills needs, manpower forecasting and education and training for business. A key element of the partnership is the expert group on future skills needs, which was set up to identify in a systematic way the skills requirements of different sectors of the economy <Col N="976" /> and to advise on the actions necessary to meet those needs. The expert group presented its first report last year. This report dealt with the skills needs of the software and electronics sectors.</P>
      <P>My Department is responding to the expert group's report in a number of ways. FÁS is providing extra training places for the electronics and software sectors. An additional £3.2 million has been allocated to FÁS in my Departments 1999 Estimate to train an extra 730 people for these sectors. Enterprise Ireland has established a programme aimed at attracting Irish people who are living abroad back to Ireland to work in the information technology sector. FÁS is also highlighting the opportunities which are available in Ireland in certain key sectors which are experiencing skills shortages. Forfás has strengthened its national skills awareness campaign, which is aimed at encouraging second level students to pursue careers in information technology. In addition to the measures being taken by my Department, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, responded to the recommendations in the first report of the expert group on future skills needs by announcing recently that 5,400 new places will be provided over the next four years in third level education to minimise future potential skills shortages in the information technology and electronics sectors.</P>
      <P>With regard to other sectors, FÁS currently provides a range of training courses to meet the skills needs of the economy. Training courses for unemployed people are developed by FÁS in consultation with local employers and are regularly reviewed to ensure that the courses are relevant to the needs of the labour market. In the case of the traineeship programme, which was piloted in 1996, employers are involved in curriculum development, the determination of standards and the provision of traineeship places. I have made a total of £53 million available to FÁS in my Department's Estimate this year for training unemployed people. FÁS also provides funding for firms who wish to update the skills of their workforce through training or re-training. In 1998, FÁS assisted over 3,300 firms to identify their training needs at all levels under the training support scheme. Skills needs of employers are further addressed through apprenticeship training. The number of apprentices in off-the-job training places in FÁS and the education system increased from 2,808 at the end of May 1998, to 3,905 at the end of May 1999. To encourage industry to identify its own training needs, a sum of £3 million is provided in my Department's Estimate this year for a pilot enterprise-led training networks programme. This initiative will facilitate companies in identifying and addressing their training and human resources development needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that there is an adequate skills supply to meet the needs of the economy. Apart from the measures I have outlined in relation to training the workforce, the recent restructuring of FÁS's employ<Col N="977" /> ment services will also help to address skills shortages by achieving a better and quicker match between job vacancies and job seekers.</P>

      <P>While investment in ports has greatly improved the capacity and quality of port infrastructure and facilities, the level of growth in Ireland's international trade and in port activity generally underlines the need for continued investment. Almost 93 per cent of trade by volume and 84 per cent by value is transported through Ireland's ports each year. The returns from the top 20 ports for 1998 show that seaborne trade is at an all time high. Ports cargo throughput in 1998 increased by some 9.2 per cent from 36.66 million tonnes to a record level of 40.05 million tonnes and passenger numbers increased by almost 6 per cent over 1997 to 4.65 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises that &ldquo;the necessary infrastructure to handle ever increasing volumes of tourism and trade has to be underpinned by continuing investment and the maintenance of competitiveness&rdquo;. The key policy objective of my Department in relation to the ports sector is to support and facilitate the availability of efficient and competitive port services.</P>
      <P>This policy objective has been given tangible expression through the transformation of the Irish State commercial seaports in the context of the implementation of the Harbours Act, 1996. Under the Act, nine of the key commercial seaports which handle over 93 per cent of national seaborne trade  &ndash; Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon Estuary and Waterford &ndash; have been corporatised as fully fledged commercial State companies.</P>
      <P>The port companies are statutorily responsible for the management, control, direction and development of the harbours as commercial operations. Freeing up the ports from direct State control gave them the commercial freedom needed to operate in a competitive environment as a modern, customer oriented service industry, while enhancing accountability for operation and financial performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been significant development in maritime infrastructural works at the commercial seaports with the assistance of EU funding. Co-<Col N="979" /> financing of infrastructural development at the ports comes through my Department, from the EU via the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, the Ireland/Wales Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative and the Cohesion Fund. On completion of the current programme of modernisation and infrastructural development at our key seaports some £163 million will have been invested in new and upgraded infrastructure and access improvements. The development and modernisation of the ports industry could not have been achieved without grant assistance under these programmes. The scale of the various funding programmes reflected the low level of investment in the ports industry generally before the programmes were put in place.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the aim, enshrined in the community support framework 1994-1999 and Partnership 2000, of reducing port/shipping costs by at least 15 per cent in real terms over the duration of the programme had been effectively achieved by 1998.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these past achievements, there still remain a number of important deficiencies to be addressed in the ports industry; ports have inadequate facilities to cope with continued massive growth which is forecast in the unitised modes in particular; competitive forces between ports need to be continually strengthened. Continued reductions in port costs will maximise competition between ports; scope exists to increase port efficiency levels to maximise the use of existing infrastructure; our ports need to continue to reduce cost levels to the lowest levels achieved in the best ports internationally; there is scope for further rationalisation of the port sector through, for example, co-operation agreements between adjacent State ports to maximise services and cost efficiencies to port users.</P>
    <P>Based on the examination of the port industry's importance to the economy and of its development needs over the period to 2007, as determined in a detailed study on future seaport capacity requirements by independent consultants, it is clear that a third national port development programme is required as part of the next national development plan. In preparation of the next NDP for post-1999 Structural Fund allocations my Department consulted fully with all the port companies and harbour authorities requesting that they identify proposals for investment priorities for the NDP.</P>
    <P>Following this comprehensive consultation process, port and maritime infrastructural development projects have been identified and costed in the context of possible funding allocations under the next round of EU Structural Funding post-1999.</P>
    <P>The challenge now is to secure necessary investment support to consolidate development of the seaports in line with economic growth and the rise in seaborne trade.</P>

The results of the prosecutions were that fines and costs were imposed in all cases, with, in one case, the confiscation of a boat in addition to the imposition of a fine with costs.</P>

      <P>The Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order, in place since 1990 prohibits the commercial fishing of sea bass by Irish sea fishing boats. I have recently renewed, for a further year, the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Order, which prohibits the sale or offer for sale of sea bass other than sea bass which has been imported into the State. I have also renewed for a further year the bass fishing conservation by-law which imposes a bag limit on anglers of two bass in any one period of twenty four hours and provides for a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season.</P>
      <P>These domestic conservation measures for seabass will continue to be kept under review over the next 12 months in light of scientific assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute of the state of seabass stocks, as well as assessments of the impact of commercial fishing effort on seabass stocks by other member states. Conservation and management strategies for inshore fisheries will also be kept under review in light of scientific stock assessments and BIM's recently published report into the Irish inshore fisheries sector.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the humanitarian situation in Kosovo is becoming clearer as access improves. A set of complex challenges face the international community in trying to take care of those Kosovar Albanians who remained behind, to manage the refugee return and plan for the harsh Balkan winter. In addition, the humanitarian agencies led by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees must ensure adequate protection for all vulnerable groups.</P>
      <P>The immediate challenge over the coming months is to ensure the security and safety of the returning refugees and of the internally displaced people and to provide for basic needs such as shelter, water, food and health care whether in Kosovo, in the camps or with host families in the neighbouring countries. The international community is at the same time planning a major rehabilitation and reconstruction effort which will last for a number of years. Not only has much of the physical infrastructure been damaged or destroyed but the civil institutions necessary to any well-functioning society must be established and developed.</P>
      <P>Ireland has responded to the Balkan crisis both at a bilateral level and through the European Union. So far grants totalling £2.6 million have been allocated in humanitarian assistance in the region. The Government is seeking Oireachtas approval for a total of £6 million to cover assistance to the region in 1999. A Supplementary Estimate to this effect has been considered and approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee and will go before the Dáil next week. This will enable Ireland to respond to the most recent appeals for funding of the UN and other agencies who have been charged by the international community with the protection of the refugees and internally displaced and with the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In addition a technical team from Irish Aid will travel to the region in the near future to monitor the funding already disbursed and to develop proposals for future assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> The European Community Humanitarian Office has disbursed 132 million euros in response to the crisis so far this year and a further 50 million euros is in the process of being allocated to support the return of refugees.</P>

      <P>In each case, there are a number of potentially suitable locations in both jurisdictions. However, since all decisions in this regard will be a matter collectively for the two administrations, North and South, it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of the decision-making process by elaborating at this point on the details of individual possible locations. However, I am fully aware of the excellent case being made for Cavan as a suitable location by the Deputy, and his representations will be treated with the utmost seriousness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to introduce a buy-out scheme like the one in 1993 whereby farmers could buy out their annuities at a discount of 50 <Col N="988" /> per cent on the outstanding capital provided any arrears of repayments were also paid.</P>
    <P>My Department has been and still is visiting farmers who have arrears with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment. If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is found that there is no good reason for non-payment of annuities my Department will take whatever action is necessary including legal action to secure due payments.</P>

      <P>The district veterinary office has been in ongoing contact with the herdowner since the herd breakdown with brucellosis in mid 1998 in an effort to finalise grant categorisation. To date all of the information required to determine grant category under the brucellosis eradication scheme grant arrangements in place for all breakdowns occurring on or after 27 April 1998 has not been furnished by the herdowner, necessitating further follow-up by the district veterinary office. When the ongoing examination of available information on the movement of eligible animals into and out of the herd during the review period is concluded, the grant categorisation process will be finalised. The district veterinary office is endeavouring to conclude the examination at an early date.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the regulations, extensification premium is payable to all herdowners where the stocking density of the holding is less than 1.4 livestock units (lus) per hectare. The person named lodged an 1998 area aid application for 123.92 hectares. He applied for, and was paid on 128 suckler cows, under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme i.e. 128 lus. He also applied for 90 animals under the ten month special beef premium scheme, three were deleted as innocent errors and six were rejected for lost tags but counted for stocking density. The remaining 81 animals were paid special beef premium (87 x 0.6 = 52.2 lus). A further application was received for 59 animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme, 23 of those were deleted as innocent errors and the remaining 36 were paid special beef premium (36 x 0.6 = 21.6 lus). The total lus of 201.8 divided by the hectares of 123.92 gives a stocking density of 1.62 lus per hectare. As the stocking density is not less than 1.4 lus/hectare the person named has no entitlement to 1998 extensification premium.</P>

The regulation also provides for possible changes in the rates and duration of the pension. The terms and conditions which will apply to the future early retirement scheme are being considered at present in the context of an integrated rural development plan which my Department has to prepare to implement the new rural development regulation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the growth of output in GDP and GNP terms.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is experiencing a period of strong output growth in terms of both GDP and GNP. Since 1993 GNP has grown by 8 per cent per annum while GDP expanded by 9 per cent per annum. This is well in excess of the growth rates achieved by our EU partners. Last year it is estimated that GNP grew by about 8 per cent. Industrial production was up 17 per cent while retail sales were over 8 per cent higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the economy will continue to expand in the immediate future, albeit at a <Col N="992" /> slower rate than in the recent past. On budget day growth in GNP of just under 7 per cent was forecast for 1999. Growth in GNP of 5.7 per cent and 5.2 per cent were forecast for 2000 and 2001 respectively.</P>
    <P>Over the medium-term it is believed that growth will slow to a more sustainable 4-5 per cent per annum. This reflects the expected slowdown in labour force growth compared with the 1990s and the tighter labour market conditions. All the components of GNP &ndash; personal consumption, investment and exports &ndash; should make a contribution to this continued growth.</P>

While it is my intention that my future budgets will complete the changeover to tax credits, they are not yet fully incorporated into our income tax system. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the allowances which were standard rated in the 1999 budget were converted to tax credits the cost to the Exchequer in a full year of refunding the unabsorbed portion of such tax credits to individuals on the income tax record would be of the order of £759 million in respect of the basic allowances for married, single and widowed persons and £165 million in respect of the PAYE allowance.

      <P>The Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited was a private company which went into voluntary liquidation in 1987. In 1988 the Government decided that the unclaimed prize money of Sweepstakes promoted by Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited should be used to benefit former employees. In December 1990 the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act 1990 enabled the then Minister for Health to take over approximately £481,000 in unclaimed Sweepstake prize money, together with accrued interest, for distribution to former employees of the company.</P>
      <P>The money was distributed to the two categories of former employees of the Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited generally regarded as being the most seriously disadvantaged when the company ceased trading. The two groups were former employees still living who opted for early retirement in 1978 or later and from whom an <i>ex gratia</i> element of pension entitlement was withdrawn in 1987 and former employees still living who were made redundant when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation in 1987. Spouses of deceased persons belonging to either of the above categories were eligible to receive the amount which the deceased person would have been qualified to receive. Persons in the first category received a flat rate payment of £1,000. The balance of moneys available after category one payments were finalised was distributed among persons in category two on the age and service weighted basis used to calculate statutory redundancy payments. The money was distributed in 1990 and 1991 to 282 persons on receipt of valid application forms.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy received an interim payment of £1,000 in January 1991 and a balance payment of £2,879.65 in March 1991, a total of £3,879.65. I would also like to inform the Deputy that these payments were made on a once-off basis as part of a special arrangement and as Minister for Health and Children I have no ongoing responsibility for former employees of Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Addison's disease has been dropped from the long-term illness scheme; if it will be restored in view of the fact this is a life threatening and long-term condition which needs daily treatment and sufferers have very heavy pharmacy bills if they are not covered under the long-term illness scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>There are 15 illnesses covered under the long-term illness scheme and the scheme has not been extended since 1975 having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines. I should also explain that Addison's disease has never been included in the long-term illness scheme.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from an ongoing condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme do not have to pay more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board for expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter.</P>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme will replace the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme, with effect from 1 July 1999 with a monthly threshold of £42. The new scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situations of families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual may, for example, in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in the month.</P>
      <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the drug payment scheme. This is in contrast to the drug cost subsidisation scheme where patients must be certified by their doctors as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new scheme will be easier to use than the drug refund scheme and will <Col N="996" /> be more inclusive than the drug cost subsidisation scheme, bringing overall benefits to a greater number of people. </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 150 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>A commencement date for the extension of routine dental treatment services under the dental treatment services scheme to persons in the 35-64 age group is part of a package of proposals drawn up in the context of a claim for a fee increase made by the Irish Dental Association, IDA, and on which an offer has been made through the health service employers agency. It is my intention to extend eligibility to this group from 1 September next provided that I can negotiate satisfactory monitoring arrangements with the IDA.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency has sought clarification from the Irish Dental Association of the association's recent decision to ballot its members on a withdrawal from the scheme. The decision to ballot and threat to withdraw from the scheme was announced to the media before my Department or the HSEA was informed. The HSEA has also indicated its willingness to have further discussions with the association in regard to its claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dentists providing services under the dental treatment services scheme and under the dental treatment benefit scheme do so under separate contractual arrangements. The IDA has nego<Col N="997" /> tiated special fee increases under the DTBS with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in return for implementation of 1997 budget provisions for the abolition of the £35,000 income limit, relaxation of dependency conditions, and the extension of dental benefit to public service workers and for dropping any claims to items which were annexed to a 1992 Agreement with that Department, viz. pensions, sick leave, study leave, etc. These special fee increases were applicable to circumstances peculiar to that Department's agreement with the IDA for the provision of services under the DTBS.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a charter of rights for hospital patients was introduced in August 1992. It provides guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis, its objective is to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of the individual patient and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the scheduling of appointments, section 2 of the charter states that you have the right, when your family doctor refers you to hospital for an out-patient appointment, to receive confirmation within a reasonable time of the date of your first appointment; be given an individual appointment time; be seen by a consultant or senior doctor on your first appointment.</P>
      <P>You have the right, should your appointment at an out-patient department be cancelled by the hospital, to receive adequate and timely notice of such cancellation and to be given a new appointment on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department has recently asked all acute hospitals to indicate if they are allocating out-patient appointment times in accordance with the standards specified in the charter. When I have received responses from the acute hospitals on this issue, I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the provisions of the charter are being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of mechanisms for improvements in patient advocacy is an important task for my Department and in this context, my objective <Col N="1001" /> is to provide a patient focused service, within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality of care, based on clinical need. The patients' charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients' rights and I intend to develop a comprehensive policy which will build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of subvention is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, and regulations made under the Act.</P>
      <P>There are three maximum levels of subvention payable, £70, £95, £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. If the rates were increased using the consumer price index to take account of inflation, the current rates would be £79.14, £107.40 and £135.66 respectively. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £9 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors such as the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is <Col N="1002" /> no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £33 million. Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on budgetary circumstances and competing priorities at the time.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take on the deepening crisis at the National Neurosurgical Department at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, in view of the pain being suffered by elective patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15880/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital is the national centre for neurosurgery in Ireland. The neurosurgical bed complement in the hospital is 90, which represents 15 per cent of the total hospital beds and 2,000 patients are treated on an annual basis. I am conscious that there has been a steady growth in demand for neurosurgical services, and in recognition of the pressures that this has placed on the national neurosurgical unit, my Department approved additional funding in 1999 for the appointment of a sixth neurosurgeon at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of Beaumont Hospital and I have been advised that current activity levels in the neurosurgical theatres are at 1998 levels, and priority is being given to urgent cases by the hospital. Furthermore, I have been advised that at present, all bed capacity is fully utilised, including an additional intensive care unit bed which was commissioned in 1998, on the basis of additional development funding from my Department. However, I understand that due to nursing shortages in theatre, it has been necessary to reduce the number of dedicated theatre sessions available to the neurosurgery department. To compensate for this reduction, the hospital has endeavoured to meet the needs of the department by using alternative theatre capacity in the hospital, subject to staff availability.</P>
      <P>This shortage of specialist nursing staff is not confined to Beaumont Hospital. While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency, HSEA. The HSEA established a task group in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the work of the task group, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the following: standardisation of overtime rates; the introduction of a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care unit; full incremental credit on permanent appointment for <Col N="1003" /> relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In addition, the HSEA is committed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. At present, the only options for permanent employment are full-time work or job-sharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives with family responsibilities back to work. The HSEA recently circulated a discussion document on a revised scheme of working arrangements to the nursing unions. A meeting between the HSEA and the nursing unions to discuss the proposals contained in the document is expected to take place shortly. This initiative is being undertaken under the programme for partnership.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department has engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study nursing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons why nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>

      <P>The group of unions nationally representing the non-nursing and related grades, which includes the staff in Cregg House referred to by the Deputy, accepted a pay increase, arising from the programme for competitiveness and work, which was recommended by the Labour Relations Commission on 2 September 1998. My Department provided funds for these staff to receive this increased national payment.</P>
      <P>I understand that the staff at Cregg House refused to accept this increase and instead successfully took a claim to the Labour Relations Commission, claiming parity with care attendants in certain named agencies. The implementation details of this recommendation have yet to be finalised between the management and unions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, Partnership 2000 for Inclusion Employment and Competitiveness provided for national increases, including a modernisation element, to apply for the duration of the programme and specifically excluded any other cost increasing claims, such as the one in Cregg House. Outstanding issues which could not be dealt with in the context of partnership 2000 were agreed to be referred to partnership committees, which include representatives of both management and unions, set up under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will accept that the challenge to a health board in situations such as that outlined is to use the powers and services available to it to provide a package of support which will best meet the needs of both the person who is ill and the carer. Depending on the specific circumstances, this package would include elements of support from public health nurses, home helps, respite care and relevant voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income earned from the payment of the carers' allowance is not taken into account when determining eligibility for a medical card. The guidelines, however, are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines set by the chief executive officers, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. <Col N="1007" /> There are also a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication for non-medical card holders. These are the long-term illness scheme, the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drugs refund scheme. With effect from July 1999 the drug payments scheme is being introduced to replace the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, a person or his/her dependants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances for use by that person or his/her dependants in that month.</P>
    <P>While there is no specific provision for the type of case the Deputy has mentioned, if the Deputy wishes to supply details I will bring the case to the attention of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board so that a suitable support package, within the limits of the resources available, may be provided.</P>

    <P>The average length of time for each operation is 20 to 30 minutes There are three ophthalmic surgeons at University College Hospital, Galway</P>
    <P>I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include: the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher that the amount allocated by the previous government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million to services for the older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected Accident and Emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists; the issuing of a new Policy Circular and Guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the Waiting List Initiative should be operated in future.</P>
    <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator-bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
    <P>The policy circular reiterates the targets of treating adults in target specialities within twelve months, and of treating children in target specialities within six months.</P>
    <P>Public in-patients waiting lists are maintained by every acute hospital in the country. In its recent policy circular on the operation of the waiting list initiative, my Department has emphasised to agencies the importance of validating these lists so that an accurate and up-to-date picture of the situation can be available at all times.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services to children with autism in County Meath is primarily the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board. In the first instance, children with autism avail of the generic services available to children with an intellectual disability in the county. However, this year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £200,000, with a full year cost of £300,000 in 2000, for the development of specific health-related support services for children with autism in the north eastern region. This funding has enabled a dedicated multi-disciplinary team to be formed to support children with autism in County Meath, and will provide early intervention services for young children and support for schoolgoing children. The posts of senior psychologist, senior speech and language therapist and medical social worker have been filled, and recruitment is under way for a senior occupational therapist.</P>
      <P>In total, this year I provided additional funding of £1.5 million with a full year cost of £2.5 million in 2000, for the further development of health-related support services for children with autism. Planning for the continued development of support services for children and adults with autism is included by the North-Eastern Health Board in their overall consideration of the needs in their region.</P>

I understand that in the case referred to by the Deputy, a number of the children from Wicklow currently attending school in Carlow receive a speech and language therapy service as part of a classroom based programme. Because of difficulties in the recruitment and retention of speech and language therapists, this service is necessarily limited at the moment.

    <P>The number of nurses in these hospitals in temporary positions is: Mullingar, 55; Tullamore, 50; Portlaoise, 27.</P>
    <P>Temporary nurses are entitled to incremental credit in respect of previous nursing service. Following the issue of Labour Court Recommendation No. 16094, agreement has now been reached with the Alliance of Nursing Unions in relation to revised incremental credit arrangements for temporary nurses. The new agreement provides for the phased implementation of full incremental credit on appointment as temporary nurses on foot of satisfactory validation of previous nursing service. The Health Service Employers Agency has notified the health agencies of the terms of the new agreement, which is effective from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Midland Health Board that it is currently in the process of converting a number of temporary posts to permanent positions under phase two of the conversion process outlined in the 1997 Nursing Pay Agreement. The board is currently arranging interviews for next week at each location where there are long-term temporary nurses who meet the qualifying criteria, and depending on vacancies to make permanent appointments. Where there are insufficient vacancies in particular locations, successful candidates will be given letters of comfort indicating that they will be offered permanent appointments in the event of a suitable vacancy arising in that location in future.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry was asked to examine the situation in two areas of the country. The Southern Health Board asked the registry to investigate the incidence of cancer in the Caherlag-Little Island area from 1992 to 1995. The registry provided a report in May 1998 showing no evidence of a cluster of cancers. The Mid-<Col N="1016" /> Western Health Board asked the registry to look at cancer incidence in Askeaton and again found no evidence of a raised incidence of cancer.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Registry has informed me that it has not received any other requests for reports on possible cancer clusters.</P>
      <P>The incidence of cancer by county is set out in the attached table for the years 1994 and 1995, the years for which national data is available to date. The registry expects to complete its national reports in respect of 1996 and 1997 in the autumn. The figures below have been adjusted by the registry to take account of age differences by region, since the incidence of cancer rises with age.</P>
      <P>The registry has warned that it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding variations in the incidence of cancer because of the small number of cases in many counties. It will be necessary to collect data for a number of further years before drawing definitive conclusions.</P>

      <P>The importance of investment in infrastructure, such as roads and water services, in underpinning continued economic growth in our economy is well accepted. For this reason, the Government has provided significant additional resources for these services since taking office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking to the future, a range of studies and reports have pointed to the need to accelerate investment in infrastructure over the next national development plan period, 2000-2006. I am confident that the Government will reflect <Col N="1017" /> this priority fully in determining the financial resources to be allocated to roads and water services over this timeframe.</P>
    <P>Investment in roads helps to offset the effects of our peripherality in Europe, and I take it that this is what the Deputy has in mind in referring to &ldquo;access costs&rdquo;.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether funding will have to be made available for the infrastructure required by the rezoning of land for development by local authorities in view of the requirements of the urban waste water directive 91/271/EEC; and, if so, the amount allocated in 1999 for this purpose.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15722/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's water and sewerage services investment programme provides funding to local authorities to meet the capital costs of providing major new waste water schemes, net of contributions from non-domestic users for the provision of services to them. In these cases, contributions, based on capacity reserved, are paid up front or over a period of up to 20 years; operating costs are paid by non-domestic users based on metered usage or on a flat rate basis. In addition, where services are provided to support commercial or residential developments, for example under the serviced land initiative, my Department will only fund a maximum of 40 per cent of the approved cost with the balance to be met by the local authorities and funded primarily by development levies raised under the planning acts.</P>
      <P>Over the period of the current national development plan covering 1994 to the end of this year, an estimated £960 million will be spent on water and waste water services to provide the services necessary to support economic and social development and environmental protection. This investment has enabled us to make good headway in meeting the obligations of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive which requires that urban areas with a population equivalent of more than 2,000 are provided with secondary treatment of waste water by the end of 2005. Major new schemes required under the directive have been completed in locations such as Tralee, Killarney and Clonmel and are under construction in many other locations including Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford, Galway, Cork, Navan, Limerick, Osberstown and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1999 capital provision for water and waste water services amounts to £275 million which represents an increase of 50 per cent on the amounts spent on these services in 1998 and includes an estimated £150 million which will be spent this year on schemes required under the urban waste <Col N="1018" /> water treatment directive. The balance of the 1999 provision is funding major water schemes and the development of services under the serviced land and rural towns and villages initiatives, the rural water programme and the water conservation sub-programme.</P>
    <P>The outstanding investment required to complete the programme of works necessary to meet the directive requirements in full will be provided under the next national development plan.</P>

      <P>I understand that Fingal County Council propose to provide additional funding to Kerbside Dublin Limited to enable that company to further extend during 1999 the &ldquo;kerbside&rdquo; collection of recyclable materials within the functional area of the council.</P>
      <P>In so far as the financing of waste services is concerned, regard must be had to the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle. The 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, strongly advocates that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services which they provide, by means of use-related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial-business concerns. Currently, Fingal County Council is one of a small minority of local authorities which does not levy household waste charges.</P>

      <P>The housing scheme at Castlegrange Heights, Swords, County Dublin was provided by the National Association of Building Co-operatives, NABCo, under my Department's rental subsidy scheme. The residents of this estate are not local authority tenants.</P>
      <P>The rental subsidy scheme does not provide for the purchase of houses by the tenants. This issue was carefully considered and it was found that a tenant purchase scheme for rental subsidy housing would not be feasible as the sale of individual houses would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
      <P>Residents of rental subsidy scheme houses of more than one year's duration who wish to become owner-occupiers may, however, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits available to local authority tenants surrendering their houses to the authority; special mortgage allowance of £4,500 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership system without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works-in-lieu; affordable housing sites; exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans; the affordable housing scheme without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria.</P>

Separate guidance also issued to presiding officers re-emphasising this point and ensuring that poll clerks under their supervision were aware of the importance of this task. Notwithstanding this advice, there have been incidences of unstamped ballot papers which is a matter of concern and one which I will keep under review.

The report is being considered by NRA and, where appropriate, additional measures will be developed with a view to enhancing the value for money realised from investment in national roads.</P>
      <P>My Department and NRA will be responding in detail to the report when it comes to be considered by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the report by the Ombudsman, Lost Pensions Arrears, with particular reference to one of the conclusions that the regulations on arrears penalty would have been struck down if they had been challenged in the High Court; the changes, if any, he proposes in law or regulation arising out of this report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Ombudsman concerns the application of the law in relation to the time limits for claiming social welfare pensions. The regulations in question, which were in existence for many years, required that people with pension entitlements make their claims within a specified period, normally three months but extended in 1994 to six months. Arrears in the case of late claims were also as a general rule limited to three or six months.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman in his report raises questions about the use of secondary legislation, i.e. regulations in general and in particular in relation to setting time limits on pension claims. He does not, as stated in the question, conclude that the Regulations in question are invalid but considers that there is &ldquo;more than a reasonable possibility&rdquo; that, if they had been challenged, they would have been struck down.</P>
      <P>I do not think any useful purpose is to be gained by taking issue with the Ombudsman on what is a question of legal interpretation to be decided ultimately by the courts. The regulations in question were made with the benefit of legal advice and in compliance with the provisions set out in the primary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations were in force for over 60 years in the case of widow's pensions, 36 years in <Col N="1024" /> the case of old age contributory pensions and 27 years in the case of retirement pensions and throughout this extended period no legal challenge was ever made to them. Regulations under the Social Welfare Acts in most cases, as in the present case, require to be counter-signed by the Minister for Finance. Furthermore it is a requirement under the Acts that all regulations are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and some in fact require that an affirmative resolution is passed before they can become applicable. Where regulations are laid before the Houses, they may be annulled if a resolution to that effect is passed by either House within 21 sitting days. No such resolution was adopted by either House in relation to these regulations.</P>
    <P>To put the matter of the validity of the regulations in question here beyond doubt, the provisions were incorporated into primary legislation in section 32 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which was enacted by the Oireachtas. That Act also extended the limit on backdating of payments in contributory pension claims from six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>As a further measure, I made regulations in February 1998 under the 1997 Act under which claims made after 1 January 1997, a proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid. These regulations also provided for the possibility of full arrears, in cases where claims are delayed due to force majeure, proven incapacity on the part of the applicant or to Departmental error, and also to alleviate current financial hardship.</P>
    <P>On reviewing the situation further, the Government was concerned that pensioners who had applied for pension prior to 1 January 1997 did not benefit from these improvements. I am happy to say, therefore, that provision was made in this year's budget, with an additional provision of £10 million, for the payment of proportionate arrears of pension in the case of late claims made prior to 1 January 1997 in respect of retirement, old age, contributory, widow's and widower's, contributory, pensions and orphan's, contributory, allowance.</P>
    <P>Payment of proportionate arrears of pension due under these new arrangements is continuing. The Department is identifying the pensioners affected by this latest development and arrears are being issued automatically to those concerned.</P>
    <P>The measures which have been taken strike a reasonable balance between the need for effective management of the system and for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty. The Ombudsman in his covering letter enclosing the report has acknowledged the steps taken to alleviate this problem. He also stated that the issue dealt with in this report represents an historical problem which, in <Col N="1025" /> the light of developments in 1997 and 1998, has now been significantly ameliorated.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
      <P>However, an exception to this rule is made in the case of widows, widowers and other lone parents who are sick or unemployed. Where a person who is in receipt of a widow(er)'s pension or one-parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment benefit at half-rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their pension. Furthermore, if they are entitled to a widow(er)'s pension or one-parent family payment at a reduced rate, e.g. on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on account of means, the rate of that payment is also increased up to the maximum level for the duration of their claim for disability benefit or unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>While any changes to current arrangements could only be considered in a budgetary context, I can assure the Deputy that the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>It is a condition for entitlement to one-parent family payment for separated persons that the claimant makes reasonable efforts, in the particular circumstances, to obtain maintenance from their spouse.</P>
      <P>My Department has explained the position in this regard to the person concerned. The Deputy himself is also aware of the position as outlined in the debate on the Adjournment on 18 May 1999.</P>
      <P>The latest evidence available to the Department is that the spouse of the person concerned is now working and should, therefore, be in a position to provide maintenance. The Department is obliged to ensure that in such circumstances the claimant seeks maintenance and advised her to contact the District Court with a view to getting a maintenance order. She was also asked to provide certain other information to enable her means to be assessed.</P>
      <P>The approach being adapted in this case is the standard approach in dealing with claims for one-parent family payment, viz. the same approach as has been adopted to this scheme since the inception of this scheme on 1 January 1997 and to the previous schemes of lone parent allowance and deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes dating back to the 1970s. The person concerned did not supply the evidence required or demonstrate reasonable efforts to get maintenance, and her claim was accordingly refused on 29 April 1999. She was informed of this decision and of her right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
      <P>If there has been any relevant change in the circumstances of the person concerned, she should inform the Department and her entitlement to one-parent family payment will be re-assessed.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme, as in the case of other social welfare schemes in Ireland, is available to all eligible persons irrespective of nationality. It would not be possible to extend the scheme to Irish nationals resident in <Col N="1027" /> Britain as this would be contrary to EU law, which in many instances prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality. This would mean, therefore, that if the scheme were to be extended on the lines suggested, it would have to be extended to all pensioners who are EU nationals coming to Ireland for temporary stays.</P>
      <P>Extending the free travel scheme to all retired citizens of the European Union visiting Ireland would have policy, cost and administrative implications bearing in mind that the scheme is based on spare seating capacity being available on public transport during off-peak hours only.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, has commenced to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the proposal to extend free travel to EU pensioners visiting Ireland will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>Under existing arrangements, where a claim to pension is made late, arrears of up to 12 months can be paid. This applies to any claims made after 1 January 1997. Under regulations which I made in 1998 additional arrears beyond 12 months may be paid on a sliding scale.</P>
      <P>For claims made prior to 1 January 1997, arrears of up to six months can be paid. In this case also I made additional provision this year for payment of additional arrears on a sliding scale at an estimated cost of £10 million.</P>
      <P>Regardless of when late claims are made there is provision to pay further arrears (even back to the date of original entitlement) in certain cases viz. where the person is proven to have been incapable of claiming on time, where wrong information was given by the Department, <i>force majeure </i>or where the claimant is currently suffering financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Arrears in respect of claims made late after 1 January 1997 are paid on an ongoing basis at a cost of some £3 million per year. It is estimated that the cost of paying full arrears in all such cases would be an additional £3 million per year.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of paying full arrears in all cases, including pre-1997 cases, regardless of the circumstances, is likely to be very substantial but the necessary information is not available to enable a fully reliable estimate to be given at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under the proposals contained in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, which was recently published, the Independent Radio and Television Commission &ndash; which, when the Bill is enacted, will be renamed as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland &ndash; will be given increased functions including the function of making arrangements for the provision of digital broadcasting services in the State additional to those provided by RTE and those which are already in existence under the provisions of the 1988 legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, in performing the functions conferred on it by the Act, shall endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services made available in the State best serve the needs of the people of the State, bearing in mind their traditions and culture. It would be open to the person concerned to apply to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland for a broadcasting content contract under the terms of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999 when it is enacted. However, I would not be hopeful that the service proposed would be feasible as a broadcast service on any of the television delivery platforms envisaged in the digital era.</P>

      <P>Whilst Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department would have no objections in principle to the local development group carrying out restoration works at the site, the site is protected under the National Monument Acts 1930-1994 as a &ldquo;recorded monument&rdquo;. This requires the owner or occupier to give two months' written notice to me of any proposals to carry out works at the site and it would be necessary that any such restoration proposals would accord with proper standards and procedures. Therefore, when a definite proposal is formulated, this should be forwarded to Dúchas for consideration, at which stage they will be in a position to assess what guidance, if any, they can give to the project.</P>

      <P>The information sheet which issues with the visa application form states that applicants should allow at least three weeks for the processing of their application. The applications in question were received in my Department on 21 May 1999. A number of queries had to be raised, the last of which took the form of a questionnaire to the applicant's reference in Ireland. This issued on 1 June 1999. When the reply was received, the case was further processed and a decision issued from my Department on 16 June 1999. It should be noted that it became apparent from the documents lodged that the applicants in this case had travelled to the State on a number of occasions without holding a visa. This is a breach of immigration law.</P>
      <P>The visa application processing fee is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The fee for the holders of Iranian passports until 1 June 1999 was £35 and that, not £70, is what each of the applicants paid. The basis for that fee was that Iran charged holders of Irish passports an equivalent amount for Iranian visas. The Diplomatic and Consular Fees Regulation 1982 to 1996 authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to charge visa fees on that basis. Since the coming into force on 1 June 1999 of the Diplomatic and Consular Fees (Amendment) Regulations 1999 a standard visa application processing fee of £20 is in operation.</P>

The Employment Equality Bill also makes provision for the application of different height criteria for men and women for this purpose but further provides that the criteria chosen must be such that the proportion of women in the State likely to meet the criterion for women is approximately, the same as the proportion of men likely to meet the criterion for men.</P>

    <P>The enrolment at the school on 30 September 1998 has decreased to 389 pupils.

      <P>The psychological service provided by my Department to primary schools is still in the development phase. During the past year, this service was enhanced by the employment of a number of psychologists on short-term contract. One of these psychologists has been assigned to a number of primary schools in County Sligo. To ensure a quality service, it is important that a realistic number of schools should be assigned to each psychologist. This inevitably means that some schools unfortunately do not currently have access to the service.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the value to schoolchildren of having a readily available psychological service and the provision of this has been one of my priorities during my time in office. On 11 February last, I announced the decision by the Government to establish a national educational psychological service agency. This agency will be formally established as and from 1 September 1999 and will begin to provide a service on that date. The process of recruiting additional psychologists for the agency has already begun. An advertisement for additional staff has been placed and interviews for the new posts will be held shortly. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five year period and most will have access before that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the request for the retention of the middle infant class in St. Laurence O'Toole's junior boys school. I reaffirm my Department's policy on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary curriculum is designed as an eight year course. It is flexible and child centred and can be adapted to cater for the individual needs of pupils. Furthermore, there is no official pro<Col N="1040" /> gramme for a middle infant class within the primary curriculum. As a general rule, primary pupils should progress from one standard to a higher standard at the end of each school year.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there may be individual cases where it is felt that a pupil would benefit educationally by remaining in the same standard for a second year. However, the number of such cases should be minimal, and under no circumstances should an additional grade level be introduced through the retention of all, or a substantial proportion of, the pupils at a grade level for a second year.</P>
    <P>The location of a school in a disadvantaged area does not constitute grounds for breaching the principles underlying this policy. There is a range of supporting measures in place to address the needs of pupils in disadvantaged areas, and St. Laurence O'Toole junior boys national school has been allocated significant additional resources in recognition of its disadvantaged status. In the current school year the school has the services of a principal teacher and two mainstream teachers, which is the appropriate staffing allocation for a school with 86 pupils. In addition, the school has two Breaking the Cycle posts, a remedial teacher and a concessionary post arising from its designation as disadvantaged. The school also enjoys the services of a shared home school liaison post and a shared counsellor. The school will retain all of these posts in the coming school year.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot allow this school to retain its middle infant class. However, officials of my Department are in discussions with the authorities of the school with a view to putting in place transitional arrangements for the coming school year.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the implications of diverting all advanced technical skills funding to information technology courses for the training of core competencies in the exploration, exploitation and management of marine resources.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The advanced technical skills programme is one element of the human resources operational programme of the Community Support Framework 1994-99. This programme provides advanced level training for graduates in order to enhance the relevance of their qualifications to the needs of the labour market and to meet the skill needs of industry at the highest level. The over-riding aim of the programme is to provide courses which are clearly relevant to sectoral economic development. The programme is run in the universities and in the Dublin Institute of Technology and receives assistance from the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>The mid-term evaluation of this operational programme by Goodbody consultants, highlighted a number of concerns relating to the ATS programme and the ESRI, in its Mid-Term Evaluation of the CSF 1994-99, recommended that public funding be reduced for the ATS. The level of financial support, including ESF aid, for the ATS programme was subsequently reduced for the remaining period of the programme. The funding available for this programme in 1999 will be fully expended on the courses approved for the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the bulk of courses included under the ATS programme in recent years were targeted at IT skills related courses in response to the critical need for graduates to meet the needs identified with the high levels of employment growth in the IT skills area. In response to the needs identified in the report of the expert group on future skills needs, under the chairmanship of Dr. Chris Horn, in relation to the provision of graduate conversion courses, arrangements are being put in place to expand the number of IT skills related conversion courses which will be available for 1999-2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a small number of aquaculture-marine related courses included under the ATS programme. The position in relation to these and other university courses that were previously funded under the ATS programme is that these courses revert to being funded from the general allocation available to the Higher Education Authority, in the normal manner. The technology foresight report on natural resources identified a range of horizontal and specific technologies for the year 2015 and argued for sustained public and private investment in all aspects of marine S and T, which would, <i>inter alia,</i> focus on support for <Col N="1042" /> targeted education, training, R and D and support infrastructures in the marine sector. The issue of further support for post-graduate education and training as a response to the economy's identified needs will be considered in the context of the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>

      <P>The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with dyslexia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to existing teachers, training and support is provided within the overall in-service pro<Col N="1044" /> vision for remedial education. Courses are supported and directly funded by the in-career development unit of my Department. Course syllabi include training in the diagnosis and identification of reading difficulties and in appropriate techniques for remediation. In particular, there is a focus on the problem of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, in relation to diagnosis and pedagogy.</P>
    <P>Many shorter courses for remedial and other interested teachers in specific learning difficulties have been supported financially by my Department. They have been provided mainly through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned since coming into office at the shortage of trained teachers at primary level. For this reason I have introduced a range of measures designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I ensured that the intake of students to the colleges of education in the current school year was increased to over 1,000. I am committed to maintaining this level of intake over the next number of years. Furthermore, I have arranged that B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
    <P>I am examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education and who have Irish either as part of their degree or to higher level grade C in the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>I further decided that from September 1998 all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education shall be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing subsituation service. Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the three year course at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire which is recognised by the NCEA shall also be granted recognition for substitute service with effect from September 1998.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the shortage of trained teachers in the system cannot be completely eliminated in the short-term. This shortage has been in existence for some years but, as a result of the improvements I have outlined, there will be a significant improvement over the coming years.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties facing schools in implementing the new curriculum in the worsened conditions for teachers and principals, particularly in small schools arising from the withdrawal of caretaker and secretarial services following the reduction in the number of community employment places available to schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15798/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>While the responsibility for the operation of the community employment schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the provision of additional assistance to schools for clerical and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional per capita grants for primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; and has been in operation since 1 September 1992. The PESP provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional <i>per capita </i>grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and secretarial services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more. Currently, all schools of 195 pupils or more, not including schools in the 1978 scheme outlined above, qualify for a grant of £30 per pupil, to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services.</P>
      <P>At second level the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at second level.</P>
      <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
      <P>All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of increasing the level of grant payable to schools, which I increased by £5 per <Col N="1047" /> student in 1997 in respect of the secondary school secretarial grant, will be examined in the budgetary context and in light of available resources.</P>
    <P>In relation to the concern expressed by the Deputy about classroom assistants, I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.</P>
    <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the Deputy's comments regarding the implementation of the revised primary curriculum, my Department has established a primary curriculum implementation group and a supporting technical working group to plan and put in place training and support services to enable schools to successfully implement the revised curriculum. These groups are representative of the partners in the primary education sector. The main element of support to schools will be provided by the primary curriculum support service which is currently being put in place and will commence providing training and support in the new school year. In this regard, forty trainers have been recruited to provide training and support on a regional basis during the forthcoming school year. The national network of education centres will also provide on-going support to schools in co-operation with the PCSP. There will be ongoing evaluation of the PCSP so as to ensure that appropriate support is provided to schools to assist them in implementing the revised curriculum over the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take these three questions together as all are related to the payment of arrears of pension to retired teachers.</P>
      <P>Arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement and Partnership 2000. In order to calculate how much is due under Partnership 2000, it is first necessary to complete the calculation of how much is due under the PCW agreement.</P>
      <P>The PCW agreement is a complex one and its final elements, those concerning in-school management, were not agreed until early 1998. In order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary. The permanent staff involved in pensions has been increased by 70 per cent, from 16 in 1997 to 27 currently. Following agreement with the staff unions, my Department also appointed ten temporary clerical officers to pensions work in June 1998.</P>
      <P>The pace of the work of payment has, however, been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &ndash; 50 per cent higher than in 1996. The work has also been delayed by difficulties in replacing temporary staff who have left from time to time. These difficulties have resulted from an agreement made at central level between the Department of Finance and the staff unions regarding the recruitment of temporary staff. Following discussions with the staff unions, it is expected that an agreement will shortly be reached which will facilitate the speedy replacement of temporary staff on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pace of the work of payment was also affected, throughout 1998, by the amount of queries received on a daily basis regarding one of the elements of the PCW agreement: the agreement <Col N="1049" /> that the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme would become a compulsory scheme and that all secondary teachers would be given the opportunity of purchasing for pensions purposes all periods of service given by them prior to their admission to the scheme. The closing date for applying to purchase service was originally agreed as 31 August 1998 but it was later agreed to extend it to 30 October 1998.</P>
    <P>With effect from January 1999, the number of queries received regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally have been greatly reduced through the issue to all secondary teachers of a comprehensive information booklet, in a question and answer format, on the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme. Similar booklets are being prepared for issue to primary teachers and vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>The position at this stage is that all 11,000 retired teachers have received, under Partnership 2000, the benefit in pension of an increase corresponding to an increase of 2.5 per cent of the first £10,436 of annual pay. In addition, all have received, at minimum, an increase of 3 per cent in pension, backdated to 1 July 1998. With regard to outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making outstanding payments to the retired teachers involved as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern of students and their parents regarding the leaving certificate higher history examination paper; his views on whether this paper was totally dissimilar to the history papers of recent years; if he will instruct the examiners to mark the answers with leniency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the content of leaving certificate and junior certificate examination papers has been the subject of much comment and analysis in the media in recent years. It is important that we view all such comment in a balanced way, having due regard for the need for validity, reliability and the maintenance of appropriate standards in our examination system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in rules and programme for secondary schools 1998-99, the syllabus requires that students be &ldquo;well informed on the particular period studied&rdquo; and that they should acquire &ldquo;an understanding of the main trends, issues and events in the social, cultural, political and economic context of that period&rdquo;. In addition, the syllabus requires &ldquo;an understanding of basic historical concepts and issues&rdquo; and expects of students that they will have acquired the ability &ldquo;to exam<Col N="1050" /> ine critically and discuss statements on historical topics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Applying the above criteria, the examination paper in History (Higher Level) for 1999 falls within the given parameters of the stated aims and objectives of the programme. It is noteworthy that all topics on the examination paper have been examined on previous occasions, while many topics have been asked on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>Each year teacher representatives submit observations on examination papers to the Department. It is Department policy to refer such observations to the chief examiner for consideration and discussion, as appropriate, with the panel of advising examiners. Due allowance is made in the marking of scripts where any shortcomings in a particular paper or in a particular question are identified through this process.</P>
    <P>Apart from ensuring that this process takes place, I believe that it would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene directly in the marking of scripts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational infrastructure in place in the area referred to by the Deputy is working very satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>A visiting teacher for travellers works in the area and is in almost daily contact with the traveller parents to encourage and support them to enrol their children in schools and also to ensure that the children attend school on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two primary schools in the area which cater for approximately 105 traveller pupils. In September 1999 the two schools referred to will have a total of seven resource teachers for travellers working with the traveller pupils. Such resource teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis that the traveller pupils are taught in an integrated setting, either within their classroom with the resource teacher working with their class teacher or withdrawn in groups for intensive tuition according to their ages and perceived needs by the resource teacher. I understand that the traveller children are fully integrated into the life of both schools, they are <Col N="1051" /> placed in classes appropriate to their age, and are making good progress.</P>
    <P>In addition there are two home school community liaison teachers and three remedial teachers working in the schools. The practice in the schools is that all the teachers catering for special needs and educational disadvantage function as a team and work as much as possible to provide a first class integrated and intercultural education for all children.</P>
    <P>There is also a pre-school for traveller children operating in the area which caters for approximately 15 children. Under present arrangements schools included in the early start pre-school scheme have the service of a child care assistant. My Department grant-aids 98 per cent of the approved tuition cost for traveller pre-schools for up to a maximum of three hours per day. Special transport, if such transport is necessary, is also grant-aided at the rate of 98 per cent.</P>
    <P>The post-primary school in the area supports the integrated education of the traveller pupils when they leave the primary school. There is also a special school for traveller pupils in the age range 12 to 15 years operating in the area in question.</P>
    <P>The Cara Park senior traveller training centre in Belcamp provides a programme of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience for young and adult traveller early school leavers aged 16 upwards. Some 30 places are provided in the centre. Responsibility for the centre transferred to the education sector from FÁS with effect from 6 April 1998. The number of places provided in the centre was increased, the programme duration extended to two years, and new guidance, counselling, psychological and child care supports were approved for the programme. In order to optimise participation of adults, particularly parents, in the centre, the upper age limit on eligibility for the programme was removed in order to influence educational participation levels in the next generation. However, I have no plans to lower the age limit for entry to the centre given the impact this could have on retention of traveller children within the school system.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational support for the children of the travelling community in the area of north Dublin is constantly under review. Discussions are held on a regular basis with the parents of the children and with the principals of the schools to ensure that the best practice pertains and that there are adequate resources available to meet the challenges presented.</P>

It is important that we view all such comment in a balanced way, having due regard for the need for validity, reliability and the maintenance of appropriate standards in our examination system.</P>
      <P>As outlined in Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools 1998-99, &ldquo;at senior level it is recommended that geography should be taught from motives which include, but which go beyond, the narrow and traditional objectives of imparting geographical knowledge and the training of students in the recall of facts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The syllabus goes on to note that &ldquo;the student should be taught to acquire facility in the use of the geographer's mode of inquiry and skills, namely the reading and interpretation of aerial photographs, maps, pictures, tables and graphs and other written sources of materials as well as an involvement in the field work process of observation and recording. Thus, while imparting a body of knowledge that is useful and meaningful to the student, the geography teacher must also be aware of his/her role in developing the student's appreciation of abstract concepts and in gaining the facility in such matters as comprehension, analysis, synthesis and the application of information&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Applying the above criteria, the examination paper in geography &ndash; higher level &ndash; for 1999 falls within the given parameters of the stated aims and teaching objectives of the programme. It is also noteworthy that all topics on the examination paper have been examined on previous occasions, while many topics have been asked on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the four days following the leaving certificate geography higher level examination on Monday 14 June, the examinations branch of my Department received about 15 telephone calls from parents, students and teachers in relation to this examination. Comments were varied in nature but concentrated on two areas. Concerns were expressed that the compulsory question <Col N="1054" /> one had been reduced from a three part to a two part question. There was also comment that, in the regional geography section, which contained four questions of which candidates had to answer one, the candidates were asked to divide a country into regions using one of five given countries as an example rather than allowing them to choose one country themselves from among the 14 countries stated in the syllabus. Callers were asked to put their complaints in writing and were told that all points made would be given full attention in the finalisation of the marking scheme at the examination conference.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware this process involves a full analysis of the examination paper by the team of markers with a view to finalising a marking scheme appropriate to the paper. Due allowance is made in the marking of scripts where any shortcomings in a particular paper or in a particular question were identified through this process.</P>
    <P>Apart from ensuring that this process takes place, the Deputy will, I hope, agree that it would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene directly in the marking of scripts.</P>

      <P>Schools are asked to make a return twice yearly, in February and October, to their local FÁS office of pupils who have left school early. The information is used for compilation of a social guarantee register so that FÁS can contact the young people concerned regarding education and training options. This register is used for recruitment onto Youthreach in FÁS and the VEC sectors. Youthreach centres have also developed referral networks linking with schools, youth services, probation and welfare, juvenile liaison, area partnership, employers and other relevant community groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of all pupils on roll on 30 September each year in post-primary schools are gathered by my Department and entered on a post-primary pupil database. By matching the previous year's file against the current file, it is possible to isolate the pupils below leaving certificate year two who did not progress to full-time education within the State in the current year. There could be a number of reasons for this including emigration, death, transfer to a private college etc. as well as <Col N="1055" /> early leaving, and there is a considerable time lag before the data is available. Details are also gathered on the numbers who leave ESF-aided programmes early and this process is now being expanded to cover all programmes.</P>
    <P>The Data Protection Act precludes the transfer of personal data in electronic format to other agencies without prior client permission or legal cover. Section 28 of the recently published Education (Welfare) Bill 1999 proposes a legal basis for the sharing of personal data with other agencies for the purpose of education or training tracking and placement, or research. In addition, the Bill raises the compulsory school leaving age from 15 to 16 or completion of junior cycle, whichever is the later, and proposes the establishment of an educational welfare service to support children, families and schools in meeting the attendance requirements of the Bill. It is also envisaged that young people aged between 16 and 18 who leave school early to enter work will be registered with the educational welfare service with a view to advising them on appropriate education and training options.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will provide a basis for a more comprehensive tracking and follow-up system to address the needs of those at risk of early school leaving, and will provide for the exchange of data with a range of agencies such as FÁS, CERT, traveller and Youthreach training centres and for research purposes. In addition, my Department intends to introduce the personal public service number for pupils in the post-primary system with effect from l August 2000.</P>

      <P>The Castlebar campus of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) began operations in 1994-95 with a full-time enrolment of 119 students on three national certificate courses in business studies, construction and computing. The enrolment for 1998-99 was 628 full-time students on 11 courses and 1,000 part-time students. At the outset it was envisaged that the full-time enrolment would reach 750 to 800 by the academic year 2002-03. The institute's current academic plan projects an enrolment of 754 students for 1999-00 and an enrolment of 1,000 students by 2002-03. This would indicate that the original targets set could be achieved three years ahead of schedule. The Deputy will appreciate that this is only made possible by the very signifi<Col N="1058" /> cant funding made available to the institute by this Government.</P>
      <P>The Castlebar campus of GMIT has performed as follows. Demand for places at the Castlebar campus is quite strong particularly for the new and novel courses developed there in such areas as rural heritage, outdoor education and leisure, computing and information technology, all of which complement the programmes available at GMIT's main campus at Galway. The Castlebar campus of GMIT is also an active participant in the national effort currently under way to address skills shortages in key areas of the economy.  The innovative and exciting developments taking place at Castlebar are enhancing the quality and excellence of the institute as a whole.</P>

      <P>The position is that my Department has a process in place to cope with any issues that arise in relation to the conduct of any of the 10,000 or so aural examination sessions. Initially this involves obtaining a detailed report from the examination superintendent.

      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate for a Minister or any other party to become involved in relation to the marking of the work of any one candidate or group of candidates.

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services. The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case. In some cases, children with mild forms of autism are educated in ordinary schools, with the support, where necessary, of remedial and resource teachers. Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools for children with mild general learning disability and schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement giving formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of children with autism. Such children are now being catered for in 40 special classes established in special schools and in mainstream primary schools throughout the country. Each special class caters for a maximum of six children, and receives the support of a teacher, a special needs assistant and enhanced capitation funding. In addition, the relevant health board provides an outreach support service.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a number of additional special classes for children with autism in a variety of locations throughout the country. It is my intention to continue to target educational support for children with autism where an assessed level of need has been identified.</P>

      <P>The two-year poetry course examined in this year's leaving certificate ordinary level Irish examination consists of five prescribed poems and three poems of the candidate's or teacher's own choice. The five prescribed poems are the same for the examination in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poetry section of Paper two, in this year's examination paper carried 55 marks out of a total of 600 marks for the entire examination. Within <Col N="1062" /> this section there were two parts: part A which dealt with prescribed poetry and part B dealing with unprescribed poetry chosen by teachers or pupils and studied as part of the syllabus requirement.</P>
    <P>In part A, candidates could choose to answer four questions on an older poem in the amhrán tradition, A Ógánaigh an Chúil Cheangailte, or to answer four questions on a modern poem Cártaí Poist, by Louis de Paor. In the case of A Ogánaigh an Chúil Cheangailte, the questions focused on the theme, the meaning of certain phrases, the metre, and the poetic devices metaphor, assonance and alliteration. In the case of the modern poem, the questions dealt with basic comprehension, the suitability of the title, the candidate's understanding of certain phrases and with metre. In the light of the centrality of these questions to an appreciation of these poems, and in view of the fact that the full text of each poem was printed on the paper, there should not have been any cause for disquiet.</P>
    <P>In part B, candidates were asked to write a brief account of the view expressed by the poet in the case of any unprescribed poem which they had studied and of their own opinion of the poet's view. They were also required to write down the title of the poem and to give the poet's name.</P>
    <P>Each year teacher representatives submit observations on the examination papers to the Department. It is Department policy to refer such observations to the chief examiner for consideration and discussion, as appropriate, with the panel of advising examiners. Due allowance is made in the preparation of the marking scheme where any shortcomings in a particular question or paper are identified through this process. Apart from ensuring that this process takes place, I believe that it would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene directly in the marking of scripts.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the content of leaving certificate and junior certificate examination papers has been the subject of much comment and analysis in the media in recent years. It is important that we view all such comment in a balanced way, having due regard for the need for validity, reliability and the maintenance of appropriate standards in our examination system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in rules and programme for secondary schools 1998-99, &ldquo;at senior level it is recommended that geography should be taught from motives which include, but which go <Col N="1063" /> beyond, the narrow and traditional objectives of imparting geographical knowledge and the training of students in the recall of facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The syllabus goes on to note that &ldquo;the student should be taught to acquire facility in the use of the geographer's mode of inquiry and skills, namely the reading and interpretation of aerial photographs. maps, pictures, tables and graphs and other written sources of materials as well as an involvement in the field work process of observation and recording. Thus, while imparting a body of knowledge that is useful and meaningful to the student, the geography teacher must also be aware of his-her role in developing the student's appreciation of abstract concepts and in gaining the facility in such matters as comprehension, analysis, synthesis and the application of information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Applying the above criteria, the examination paper in geography &ndash; higher level &ndash; for 1999 falls within the given parameters of the stated aims and teaching objectives of the programme. It is also noteworthy that all topics on the examination paper have been examined on previous occasions, while many topics have been asked on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>Each year teacher representatives submit observations on examination papers to the Department. It is Department policy to refer such observations to the chief examiner for consideration and discussion, as appropriate, with the panel of advising examiners. Due allowance is made in the marking of scripts where any short<Col N="1064" /> comings in a particular paper or in a particular question are identified through this process.</P>

      <P>Inquiries have been made with the local authorities and vocational education committees in Cork and Mayo and I understand that there is no record of an application for financial assistance having been received from this student. Accordingly, she should be advised to apply to Mayo County Council in order to have her eligibility for a third level maintenance grant assessed.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, other than European Social Fund &ndash; ESF &ndash; aided courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved third level institutions. I understand that the Higher Educational Authority is in discussions with the college authorities regarding the eligibility of this course for inclusion in the free fees initiative. The question of the student's eligibility for a back to education allowance should be addressed to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
