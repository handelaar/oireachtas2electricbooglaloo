    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 29 together.</P>
      <P>On 18 December, following negotiations and consultations involving Assembly parties and, as appropriate, the Irish and British Governments, the First and Deputy First Ministers designate reported that agreement had been reached on the departmental structures and on North-South co-operation. The ten new Departments and corresponding ministerial offices which will be responsible for the work of the current six Northern Ireland Departments will be: Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment; Regional Development; Social Development; Education; Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment; Enterprise, Trade and Investment; Culture, Arts and Leisure; Health, Social Services and Public Safety; and Finance and Personnel. In addition, the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will have an economic policy unit and special responsibility for equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> In relation to North-South co-operation, six areas were identified as suitable for the establishment of implementation bodies. These were Inland Waterways; Food Safety; Trade and Business Development; Special EU Programmes; Language; and Aquaculture and Marine Matters. In addition, six areas were identified as suitable for co-operation through existing bodies: Health, Transport, Agriculture, Education, Environment and Tourism. A publicly owned limited company is to be established in relation to the latter.</P>
    <P>On 18 January, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister designate submitted their joint report to the assembly. I look forward to the final report which will be submitted to the assembly for 15 February and which will facilitate the enactment in the UK, by the target date of 10 March, of the legislation enabling the formal transfer of legislative powers. Our timetable will proceed broadly in parallel and the objective of both Governments is to have all the Agreement institutions go live shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>I have continued to meet and liaise with the parties and others on Northern Ireland before and after Christmas. In recent weeks I have met the First Minister designate, Mr. David Trimble, the Deputy First Minister designate, Mr. Seamus Mallon, Mr. Seán Neeson, leader of the Alliance Party, Mr. Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Féin, and Mr. Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin. I have also been in regular contact with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. I do not propose to report in detail on each meeting or telephone conversation I have had. However, recent discussions have focused on progressing the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in all its aspects. The question of further meetings with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>We all know that difficult issues remain to be dealt with. All the parties to the talks are aware of their obligations and we expect them all to deliver. We must all be willing to take those vital steps forward together in the coming weeks to get over the current impasse. We must ensure that the implementation process is credible, that progress is made and that a political vacuum is not allowed to develop. The process is about bringing an end to a conflict that has dogged this country and its people for too long. It is about delivering good, democratic, accountable governance in Northern Ireland and real practical benefits to the people, North and South. The sooner we are able to do this, the better.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government is pressing on with the work of preparing for the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies. Officials from the relevant Departments, together with officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, are engaged in an intensive programme of work with their Northern counterparts to ensure that the North-South institutions are ready at the same time as the other institutions as required by the British-Irish Agreement and <Col N="849" /> the appropriate legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the Commonwealth paid a courtesy visit to me on 10 December in Government Buildings, during which we had a friendly exchange on a number of issues.</P>
    <P>I propose to visit Northern Ireland again next Friday. I will undertake a number of functions, including attending a lunch in Armagh and a reception in Newry, in response to invitations from Armagh District Council and Newry and Mourne District Council respectively.</P>
    <P>I look forward to visiting the United States for St. Patrick's Day again this year. The programme for this visit is in preparation.</P>
    <P>On the issue of further meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I make the point that this is not a matter for me or the Government but for the chairperson and all the participating parties. I refer the Deputy to my reply to previous questions on 8 December and 6 October.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of according Oireachtas representation to the citizens in the Six Counties, I wrote to the Chairman of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution on 11 April, following the conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement. I suggested that the committee might consider how people living in Northern Ireland might play a more active part in national political life to the extent that they desire and in a spirit consistent with the principles underlying the peace settlement.</P>
    <P>I understand the committee subsequently invited written submissions from the main political parties in Northern Ireland and it received the latest submission on 7 December. The committee intends to invite interested parties and individuals to make oral submissions in February.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the committee published a progress report on the Presidency last November. It is now examining the provisions in relation to the national Parliament and it will report thereon as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 1, will the Taoiseach indicate whether extra staff will be recruited in any of the various Departments dealing with legislation arising from the British-Irish Agreement? Does he agree that there is a need to be severe in prioritising legislation because of the backlog? Will that be dealt with by the recruitment of extra staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to cross-Border negotiations, will the Taoiseach comment on the extent of discussions currently under way to move the decommissioning issue forward? Does he consider there is a role for non-governmental agencies and organisations in that regard, such as church leaders who recently suggested a monument based on metal and old materials, similar to the monument between Chile and Argentina following conflicts in that part of the world? Will the Taoiseach respond to those suggestions and outline how they might fit into the process of decom<Col N="850" /> missioning? Is the Taoiseach aware of the Garda belief that the Provisional IRA was involved in the Dalkey raid on a Securicor van? What implications does he feel that might have? Does he agree a serious vacuum will develop unless progress is made on the decommissioning issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to staffing, additional staff have not been taken on as of yet. However, when the implementation bodies are set up in a permanent location and when structures are working, there will be a requirement for further staff to ensure the system operates effectively. Some estimates of that have been outlined by the Department of Foreign Affairs but the proposals are only tentative at this stage. Staff who work in Northern Ireland at present would comprise part of the new staff.</P>
      <P>On the issue of church and community people assisting in overcoming the current impasse, there is always a role for them. Church and community leaders have been of significant assistance over the past decade in these matters.</P>
      <P>On decommissioning and the impasse generally, the Deputy will be aware that I have repeatedly conveyed my views on these matters. Parties set out their positions on all issues, including decommissioning. However, it is not particularly helpful at times for parties to reiterate entrenched positions and become more defensive in the process. We have all invested a great deal of time in this process and if we are to make progress, we must face up to the reality of difficult issues such as those referred to by the Deputy. We have faced such issues in the past and have come through successfully. We can get through the current difficulty too if all sides are willing to do what is asked of them under the terms of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that whenever there is a vacuum in a political process, there is a tendency for people to use their hands in mischievous ways. That is a always a concern. We have witnessed it happening many times in recent years. The more political action and dialogue that occurs, the better.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Dalkey raid on a Securicor van on 4 January, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that investigations into the armed robbery are ongoing and that no conclusions have been arrived at by the investigating gardaí about paramilitary involvement. I am aware of claims made in recent interviews that the Garda or the Government are, for some unspecified political reasons, seeking to suppress knowledge of Provisional IRA involvement in this robbery. That is totally without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that the Government is not suppressing knowledge in this matter. I take it that, regardless of possible political consequences, the Government would not suppress such knowledge. Has the Taoiseach examined whether it is likely that the weaponry used in the raid came from IRA <Col N="851" /> stocks given that it was of an AK 47 variety which is apparently one in which the IRA specialised? What procedure would be used to determine whether an action was carried out by a particular organisation and whether such action constituted a breach of the ceasefire? Would such a judgment be made by the Garda Commissioner or would it be made politically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>Regarding the examination of arms, I understand it is part of the Garda investigation and they have not yet reported. The judgment will be that of the Garda Síochána because the Government has no other source of information. The House will recall that in the first few days following the attempted raid, the view was that a group from a particular organisation was responsible. I have received no further information since, but the Garda Síochána have not been able to confirm it either. I assure Deputy Bruton and the House that any report made by the Garda Síochána will not be suppressed.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of reports in at least one newspaper that the Provisional IRA have acknowledged their involvement in the armed kidnap in Dungannon of Mr. Fox? Would participation in an armed kidnap, where arms were used to intimidate the person but were not necessarily discharged, constitute a breach of the ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard any act of violence as a breach of the ceasefire. I have said that in relation to punishment beatings on a consistent basis. We have heard what the Garda Síochána and the head of the RUC have said about punishment beatings over the past weeks since we last discussed Northern Ireland issues here. The difficulty in all of these matters is to prove them. There are conflicting reports about who is involved. The fact that something happens in a particular community cannot be taken as meaning that it is part of an organisation. That was stated recently following a number of incidents in Belfast. Under the Mitchell principles, which were the guiding principles over recent years, I take the view that any act of violence against property or, more importantly, persons, is a breach of what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>The political bodies associated with these events have totally and unreservedly condemned them as strongly as I have, and have dissociated themselves from them. In so far as there is evidence from both loyalist and republican sources, there is substantial proof to show <Col N="852" /> that the political organisations have been endeavouring through many initiatives on the ground to stop such activities. In my discussions with republican representatives &ndash; I have not spoken directly to loyalist representatives of late &ndash; their attitude is condemnation and an intention to do all they can to see such activity is eliminated from the two communities. They have no direct control over it and no evidence of who is involved.</P>

      <P>In the light of the upbeat comments made by the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, in Dublin at the weekend, is the Taoiseach confident that the establishment of the Executive in shadow formation will be achieved by 15 February, less than two weeks from today? Consequent on his meetings with Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams, will the criteria of reasonable progress on decommissioning set down by Mr. Trimble be achieved by that date? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to be either upbeat or downbeat following anything that happened at the weekend. I am satisfied all parties and political representatives are endeavouring to find ways to meet the deadline, not so much that of 15 February but that of 10 March, and to find ways through or around the impasse. Of course, it is difficult. We have to try to find some formulation, under General de Chastelain, the chairperson of the International Commission on Decommissioning, which can do this, but there is no such proposal yet. Mr. Trimble and everybody else stressed that they will do all they can. I am continually urging them that we must press ahead with the implementation of the Agreement. We all have to continue to work towards the deadline.</P>
      <P>From our point of view we are facing it realistically in the knowledge that people North and South want it to succeed. We are endeavouring to assist the parties in every way we can and we are working closely with the British Government in doing this. I continually put it to all the parties, particularly those which can influence the matter, that if people want a society in which people can live together, where diversity is recognised and accepted and where the normal decencies of civilised behaviour is allowed flourish, they must accept their responsibilities. If people approach it from this point of view and acknowledge what they have negotiated in the Agreement, we can find a resolution. However, I do not underestimate the difficulties in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question specifically concerning the target dates set down. The Taoiseach seems to imply he is not terribly anxious about the deadline of 15 February for the establishment of the Executive and shadow formation, and rather looks to the deadline of 10 March for the transfer of powers. Is he saying he is now less confident that the deadline of 15 February, which is less than a fortnight away, will be achieved in terms of establishing the Executive <Col N="853" /> and shadow formation? In relation to decommissioning and a formula being worked on, does the Taoiseach agree the least which can be done by paramilitary groups in the interim is for a clear demand by those signed up to the peace process to call for an end to punishment beatings, that this would at least be a signal that the path of violence has been completely left behind and that all parties are working wholeheartedly towards achieving an agreement in an entirely peaceful way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that would be very helpful. A number of political individuals have made their views clear on the matter, something which did not happen in the past in terms of punishment beatings and which I certainly appreciate. The number of punishment beatings declined last year in comparison with the previous year, but still amounts to 200 per annum. Information shows that not all punishment beatings are linked to paramilitary bodies. A large proportion are split between loyalists and republicans, but many more are not connected with either group and are undertaken by communities or individuals, which is also in no way acceptable.</P>
      <P>Regarding the deadline, of course it would be desirable to have a resolution tomorrow, but 15 February is the date on which the First Minister designate and the Deputy First Minister will make their report to the Assembly. I am not sure that date will bring a resolution of the other matters &ndash; I do not think it will. It would be nice if there was a resolution, but we have to try to get a resolution between that date and the end of February. This month is crucial and we have to do as much as we can to resolve this issue which will then allow everything to fall into place. Side by side with trying to find a resolution to the impasse, work is going ahead on the structures of the Departments, the legislation both here and in Westminster for the North-South bodies and on areas of co-operation. Detailed discussions are going on between both Governments and the NIO to try to conclude the make-up and all the relevant details. Preliminary work is also being done on the North-South Ministerial Council. We are not, therefore, allowing one matter to take up all our time. Ultimately, we cannot move to the next stage until we achieve a resolution of the impasse.</P>

      <P>In light of his answer on punishment beatings, that the paramilitary organisations concerned have condemned them, have no control over them and have no evidence about them, will the Taoiseach define what is in his view the relationship between these parties and these paramilitary organisations, bearing in mind that the parties agreed a procedural motion in September 1997 that the arms issue was an indispensable part of the process of negotiation? How could they say and affirm that if they have no control over those who have the arms and are using them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for six months and it is renewable. Again, there is a limit on that in that it is renewable on two occasions. In all, the time involved could be about a year and a half.</P>
      <P>The political representatives, not the paramilitaries, are condemning the punishment beatings. Obviously, it is the paramilitaries who are involved in punishment beatings but their political leaders have been trying to deal with the issue. The difficulty is that some of these matters relate to law and order and community issues. Over the Christmas period there were two accidents in which young people were killed as a result of joyriding. Unfortunately, in Northern Ireland, or at least in some parts of it, the community tends to put pressure on others instead of turning to the security forces as they would in this part of the country. I would like to see them moving away from that position, but public calls and demands have been placed on these organisations. It is a very unsatisfactory position.</P>
      <P>The political wings of the paramilitary groups are endeavouring, along with the authorities, to find a democratic way to deal with this type of terror, and they have put much effort into it. An alternative must be found, a community policing format of whatever type. There are examples and there have been conferences in the North to try to find an alternative way to deal with these matters. In some areas where there is a lack of confidence in the RUC, people tend not to follow that route. The police commission is very conscious of this matter too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> An alternative must be found because it is not satisfactory that there is almost one punishment beating per day. Over the past few weeks there seems to have been more rather than fewer punishment beatings. Whether it is community policing where the community is involved in a democratic way, as happens here with Neighbourhood Watch, some format will have to be found. A year ago I said to loyalists and republicans that they should work with the authorities to find an alternative and they are now doing so, which I appreciate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that if a member of the public is in the situation described by the Taoiseach and wants a punishment meted out in the interest of justice as they see it, the only people they could approach are people who are already known in the public as representative of and linked with an organisation, in other words, political representatives? Is it not the case that the initial point of contact between the member of the public who wants punishment meted out and, ultimately, the people who will carry it out is likely to be a visible political representative of some kind who may be associated with a party because members of the public cannot go directly to secret organisations? If that is the case, surely there has to be some measure of involvement of the political parties in at least passing on information which leads to punishment beatings taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not believe that is what happens. Unfortunately, in some of these communities active or former members of paramilitary organisations, who are extremely well known but who are not in the political domain, discuss this matter at times with members of the RUC. The same happens in both loyalist and republican communities. The people who are political in both the loyalist and republican organisations would like to see an end to that because they believe these barbaric attacks undermine their credibility, and that of everyone else, and do not bring any blessings on the communities in which they take place. That is the reason for the work on the policing commission, and whatever conclusions come from that, and the ongoing work in these communities to find some method of co-operation through community policing and involvement on a democratic basis.</P>

        <b>:</b> On the same theme, does the Taoiseach agree that savage, so-called punishment beatings have a certain tolerance in many working class communities even though they are carried out by paramilitary organisations which have no democratic accountability to any community? Will he agree the reason for that tolerance is that these communities are plagued by social problems, crime and so-called joy-riding and that because of the way these communities feel exposed, this is the inevit<Col N="856" /> able result? Will the Taoiseach agree that the key question is the development of a community-based civil force to deal with such crime and anti-social behaviour?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts have been ongoing, particularly over the past year, by the communities, including all their political representatives, to find alternative means of co-operating in this regard. The difficulty in parts of Northern Ireland &ndash; this cannot be avoided &ndash; is that the normal police, the RUC, is not accepted and the flow of information necessary to deal with crime does not pass to them. The police commission and the RUC are well aware of this problem and are trying to find solutions to it. Some form of community involvement is necessary and I hope the current efforts by the communities to find an acceptable and democratic way to deal with social problems in these areas in the future will succeed. I appreciate the efforts of those people who are involved in that and I am aware they have researched this question outside of these islands to try to find a way to overcome this difficulty.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the strength of the vote by the pro-Agreement parties in the Assembly on 18 January, approving steps forward for the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, effectively routed the anti-Agreement elements and provided David Trimble with a renewed mandate to fulfil his obligations as First Minister-designate and to allow the Executive to be established? The Taoiseach and the House should note that I, again unhesitatingly, join my party colleagues in the Northern Assembly and other opinion in a further appeal to those responsible, irrespective of whom they may be, to end punishment beatings, which are abhorrent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his last remark which is helpful. Regarding the vote in the Assembly, it was a rout of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side. The ratio was almost 70:30 and any such vote is evidence of the strength of the pro-Agreement element. I was glad to see it happen, as were all the parties involved, because it was a victory for David Trimble and everyone else involved. I hope the same happens on 15 February when the paper comes forward.</P>
      <P>As regards progress being made, there are no preconditions to prevent it. There is an understanding of what needs to be done to ensure the Agreement is implemented in all respects, rather than harping on about one specific area. People in the North have stopped doing that, so we should not start doing it here. It is clear where the grounds for compromise are and, hopefully some resolution can be found. The prize for finding a resolution to the impasse is that we could move very quickly &ndash; I was asked on a Northern interview what that means and I said immediately &ndash; to the setting up of the Executive and the ministerial North-South body for the Assembly and all its sub-committees and committees to work normally. We could then move on with all the other aspects of the Agreement. That can be done if we can overcome the impasse. As per the Assembly vote on 18 January and the vote on 22 May, clearly that is what the people want us to do. We must ensure the Agreement is implemented in all respects. If there is trust and confidence we can move forward very rapidly.</P>

We have worked on the basis that everything can happen together and I believe that is possible. We still have a difficulty but I appreciate people are trying to focus on that. The way to resolve it is under General John de Chastelain and within his remit. If we can do that we can move very quickly.

There are key suspects in all of these cases, particularly the ones who received much public attention in Omagh. There is no secret in Border areas that the Garda and, on the other side of the Border, the RUC have been focusing much of their effort on certain individuals. Nobody in those communities would need to be a great detective to know that, but to start naming them in Parliaments is not correct and it should not be done. This is a matter on which the security forces are co-operating. Mr. Ronnie Flanagan, the head of the RUC, and Commissioner Pat Byrne are doing everything they can to deal with this matter in their investigations. They, together with the men and women who work for both forces, are more anxious than anybody else to try to resolve it.</P>

It has met the political parties and many business, social and sporting community bodies throughout the North. It is looking at work outside the country and at other models also.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether it is unfair and unjust to assess pensioners and other social welfare applicants with an income on the false basis that they are getting interest rates of either 7.5 per cent or 15 per cent on their bank savings when they may be getting as little as 0.2 per cent; and if he will change this system immediately to reflect the facts.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to the Deputy recently that, while the formula for assessing capital includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, it is important to note that the effective assessment rates are much lower. To determine the effective assessment rates account must be taken of the significant capital disregard of £2,000. There are other aspects of the means test which, when they interact with the assessment formula, operate to further reduce the effective assessment rates. For instance, in the case of old age, widow and widower pensioners, the first £6 of weekly assessable means does not affect entitlement to payment. In the case of a couple, means are taken to be half of the joint means. This results in a <Col N="861" /> couple being able to have double the amount of means that a single pensioner can have.</P>
      <P>The revised method of assessing capital, which was introduced for non-contributory pensions in 1997 by my predecessor, is designed to take account of all the above factors. Old age, widow and widower pensioners can have significant amounts of capital and still qualify for payment. For instance, a single old age pensioner can have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension. A married couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension. A single pensioner can have up to £38,348 in capital &ndash; £40,428 from June &ndash; and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have up to £76,696 &ndash; £80,856 from June &ndash; before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
      <P>The majority of old age pensioners have no capital or insufficient capital to be assessed for means test purposes. Only a small minority have capital in excess of £20,000. In practice, therefore, the effective rate of assessment of capital is well below 7 per cent in the vast majority of cases. For example, a couple with capital of £20,000 would be assessed with means of £600, giving an effective rate of assessment of just 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The present arrangements are designed to ensure that those with smaller amounts of capital at their disposal receive a greater share of available support than those who have large amounts of capital available to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. I am aware the interest rates available on investments have fallen in recent times, particularly in the context of the introduction of the euro. My Department is reviewing the formula currently used for assessing the value of capital. Reducing the assessment rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent to the current levels of interest available on bank deposit accounts would disproportionately benefit those who are well off. This was the rationale behind the decision by my predecessor to set the assessment rates at their current levels.</P>
      <P>Any proposals to further ease the assessment of capital would have financial implications and would, therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and other commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy. The £6 per week increase for elderly pensioners announced in the budget will be of benefit to all old age and widow and widower pensioners aged 66 and over. This means that all such pensioners will receive the £6 increase in full, even where they are receiving a reduced rate of payment because of the assessment of means.</P>

Does he accept that following the introduction of the euro <Col N="862" /> interest rates on bank deposits have collapsed with the result that old people with a few thousand pounds set aside, normally for funeral expenses, are being assessed at enormous rates of interest?

      <P>The Deputy who used the words &ldquo;highway robbery&rdquo; has a short memory. This method of assessment, which he is now decrying, was introduced by my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa. On 5 March 1997 Deputy Durkan, then Minister of State at my Department, said, &ldquo;To bring in more uniform, consistent and even-handed treatment of capital means, the provisions contained in section 25 mark a further step along the road by applying new and more generous rules to all means-tested pensions and the carer's allowance&rdquo;. On 12 March 1997 Deputy De Rossa said, &ldquo;I am continuing this year with the process of improving and standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital and savings.Because of the changes the effective rate for couples with £20,000 is just 3 per cent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister know anything about his brief? We are talking about old age non-contributory pensioners to whom the death grant does not apply. Last week with some ceremony the Minister ushered in the International Year of Older Persons. Does he accept that his attempts to justify this bizarre and outrageously unfair system will not wash? Following the introduction of the euro on 1 January interest rates have fallen to as low as 0.2 per cent. Does the Minister accept that old age pensioners are being assessed under false pretenses at rates of 7.5 per cent or 15 per cent and that the system must be changed? Recently the parish priest on Achill spoke about the need to decommission the biscuit tin to encourage old people not to keep money in their homes. This system is encouraging a reversal of that worthy plea.</P>

      <P>A total of 75 per cent of old age pensioners have no means. Only 2 per cent have capital of £20,000 and over. The Deputy's then colleague in the rainbow coalition Government said that anyone with capital of £20,000 would be <Col N="863" /> assessed at an effective rate of 3 per cent. The Deputy is misleading the public by suggesting the rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent should be reduced. He is well aware that the disregards are extremely generous. They were put in purposely by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, and I compliment him on that, because he was treating people at the lower end of the scale more favourably than those at the upper end.</P>

If we were to reduce the 7.5 per cent to a combined rate of 1 per cent with the retention of the current disregard of £2,000 we would, effectively, give the maximum pension to a person who had capital of £66,000. Interestingly, in relation to the pre-retirement allowance, if we were to reduce the rate to a combined 1 per cent, a single person with capital of £428,000 or a married couple with capital of £856,000 would qualify for an allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that men and women are treated equally in relation to access to all social welfare schemes and services. Ireland has given full effect in legislation to the EU directives on equal treatment in both statutory and relevant occupational social security schemes. As a result, all of the social assistance and insurance schemes operated by my Department are available equally to men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> A new one-parent family payment was introduced in January 1997 and replaced the lone-parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit schemes. The new payment covers both men and women equally, irrespective of whether they are married, separated, widowed or divorced and irrespective of the reason for lone parenthood. A notable feature of this measure is that the requirement to prove desertion has been removed from the social welfare code, thus eliminating a requirement which was particularly difficult and degrading for many women.</P>
    <P>A new widower's non-contributory pension was introduced from October 1997 which is available to widowers on the same basis as applies to widows. The more restrictive conditions which apply to the benefits available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme for both widows and widowers were amended to apply on the same basis as applies to the schemes for widows and widowers generally. In short, this involved the alignment of the qualifying conditions applying to the widow's and widower's pension schemes available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme with all other social welfare schemes for widows and widowers. These changes took effect from April 1997. Arrears of equal treatment payments owing to 70,000 married women amounting to almost £300 million were paid.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997 with the main objective of tackling poverty and social exclusion. Several principles underlying this strategy are implicitly related to equality of access and addressing discrimination. These include ensuring equal access and encouraging participation by all and the reduction of inequalities and, in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty.</P>
    <P>The effect of the measures I have outlined is to complete a programme of equal treatment which ensures that all of the social assistance and insurance schemes operated by my Department are available equally to men and women.</P>

      <P>Is it true that what the Minister has just said is not the case? Consider the rises announced in the budget and shortly to be introduced. The adult dependant's allowance for people on unemployment assistance will rise from £41.20 to £43.20 and for people on non-contributory pensions from £41.20 to £44.20. The adult dependant's allowance for people on invalidity benefit will rise to £49.50 and so on. Does the Minister consider it possible, in early 1999, for the adult dependant of a social welfare claimant in one of these wide categories to live on £43.20 per week? How much does the Minister think an Irish man or woman would need to live in modern conditions, bearing in mind the average industrial wage and the average level of social welfare payments?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the issue of equalisation. A working group has been <Col N="865" /> set up, chaired by my Department, to examine and compare the treatment of one and two parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. Part of that examination is of the issue of income support and the individualisation of it. That group is to report in the first half of 1999. The Commission on Social Welfare has recommended that adult dependant rates should be approximately 60 per cent of the maximum rate. That was one of my aims in both recent budgets in relation to social welfare. We will endeavour to keep adult dependant rates as close as possible to the recommended 60 per cent.</P>

The Minister has not answered my question. Does he think the princely sum of £2,300 is enough for an adult Irish citizen to live on in 1999? The Minister presides over this situation. He is in charge of the biggest spending Department of Government and he has the power to change this situation, once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of December 1998 there were 11,416 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance at an annual cost of more than £45 million.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and launched by me in October 1998.</P>
      <P>The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. The major issues raised by these groups were the removal or easing of the carer's allowance means test, the introduction of a needs assessment and the provision of adequate respite and other health care services.</P>
      <P>The review examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, I introduced a range of measures in the 1999 budget to improve and develop the position of carers. More than 11,500 existing carers will benefit from the measures I have introduced while an additional 3,300 new carers will now qualify for a carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>This budget package, costing more than £18 million, represents a 40 per cent increase on existing expenditure and is a very considerable addition to the £45 million spent on carers in 1998, bringing to an estimated £63 million the amount being spent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the rate of the carer's allowance will increase in June this year by £3 per week for recipients of the allowance who are under age 66 and by £6 per week for those who are over age <Col N="868" /> 66. This represents an increase of 4.1 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively on current rates.</P>
    <P>Other measures proposed in the review, which will be advanced in the coming year, include the introduction of a needs assessment, encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carers. This would separate care needs from income support and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. The Government has agreed that a working group, to be chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, and also comprising representatives from my Department, the health boards and other relevant Departments be set up to advance this proposal as quickly as possible. This is currently being progressed by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a PRSI carer's benefit to facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care. The review envisaged that this would be financed through the PRSI system. The proposal would require, for example, an increase of the order of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points in each of the current employee and employer PRSI rates depending on the level of the Exchequer contribution. This proposal, at a cost £42 million, deserves further full examination and I would be interested, for example, in the views of the social partners in this regard.</P>
    <P>Looking towards the longer term, a further PRSI benefit arrangement for care recipients, that is, those in need of care was also proposed in the review. Given that there is a high probability that many of us will need some form of long-term care, such an arrangement could enable care recipients to meet some or all of the costs of their own care. The Government agreed, given the complexity of the issues raised, that this proposal should be pursued at the policy and operational levels as a separate consultancy project and my Department will be progressing this later this year.</P>
    <P>The measures I introduced in the budget and the additional proposals outlined above clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers, who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities, and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. In addition, I must emphasise that the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers in the recent budget. The Government is conscious that such a cross departmental approach is required. This was the reason we endeavoured to co-ordinate our approach to carers.</P>

      <P>Having listened to that diatribe for the past five minutes, is it necessary to have such a diary of words in response to a simple question? It makes a mockery of Question Time.

      <P>Figures can vary depending on to whom one talks. From my recollection, in the carer's review it is estimated there are approximately 40,000 carers. As a result of a survey of health boards and people working in the area, the carer's allowance review suggests there is a strong desire to pinpoint, on an individual basis, those in need of care and the needs of carers. That is why we examined the implementation of a needs assessment and set up an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to progress that.</P>

      <P>It is wrong that more than two-thirds of carers do not get the carer's allowance. Does the Minister agree it is economically wise and socially just to give encouragement to carers? It has been brought to my attention by the Carer's Association that, in some instances, tax is paid on the small amount of money paid to carers. Will he accept that is unfair? Will he agree that in this International Year of Older Persons care of the elderly is one of the main political themes? Does he accept we should all do a good deal more for carers, particularly for those who do not get any allowance, and that we should take on board the points raised by the Carer's Association, CROSSCARE and the other organisations which are doing such good work in this area?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we should all be doing as much as we can. I would have thought the Deputy would at least have acknowledged that, in the carer's allowance area alone, the estimated expenditure will increase from last year's figure of £45 million to £63 million. Nine major proposals which were made in the carer's allowance review were delivered upon in the budget. Carers got a very substantial increase, £6 for those over 66 years and £3 for those under 66 years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of people paying tax on the carer's allowance. This issue was raised by the Carers Association when it met me.</P>

      <P>I subsequently raised it with the Department of Finance which made the point, with some validity, that all income should be treated on the one basis, which has always been <Col N="870" /> the way. Perhaps the Deputy will understand that if he is ever Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I stated earlier that the Government brought forward in the recent budget a package of measures for carers across a number of Departments. The carer's allowance is taxed if the carer has other income. However, we raised the income tax level so that people earning £100 will not pay tax, which is a tremendous achievement and milestone. Many people in the public domain had asked for that and we delivered it in one budget.</P>
      <P>Many people do not realise that the Minister for Finance, in acknowledgement of the issues of carers, to which I know he is very dedicated, also extended the carer's tax allowance, which was a very generous £8,500 but which applied only to a person caring for their spouse, to members of the immediate family. That is very much to be supported.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children brought forward a number of initiatives in the area of respite care. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government brought forward very significant improvements in the disabled person's grant and essential repairs grants, specifically for carers.</P>
      <P>These changes are incremental. We are endeavouring, over the coming years of this Government, to build upon the very substantial improvements we made in the recent budget.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe is correct in that all the carers' associations, such as CROSSCARE on the northside of Dublin, were bitterly disappointed with the budgetary provisions and the number of areas which the Minister did not look at. The Minister mentioned the sum of £63 million and what his colleagues are doing. Has the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and his committee engaged in cost-benefit analysis of the role of carers?</P>
      <P>Carers telephone Deputies every day to tell us about the incredible work they do in looking after severely disabled and elderly people. If the State and the health service were totally responsible for that role, is it not true that it would cost hundreds of millions of pounds? Carers are saving us those sums, yet the Minister is behaving in a most miserly way towards them.</P>

It is in my Department &ndash; the Deputy said earlier that my colleagues were doing it &ndash; that £63 million is being spent on the carer's allowance. It is a very substantial allowance and one which, as I have acknowledged here before, needed some investigation because we needed to see where it was going after eight or nine years.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy in regard to carer's associations. Many of the carers' lobby groups were somewhat happy &ndash; obviously they were not happy with everything that was done &ndash; with the fact that a substantial carer's package was delivered in the budget and that we particularly acknowledged the investigation of the needs assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that. I have asked the question so often that I know it by heart. What is the Minister doing about the situation whereby a carer who becomes a widow loses her carer's allowance? For example, if a married woman is caring for her husband's doubly incontinent bedridden father and her husband suddenly dies, she qualifies for the widow's pension to compensate her for the loss of her husband, but she immediately loses the carer's allowance. That is a desperate anomaly in the scheme &ndash; I have made that case to the Minister on many occasions. I have also made that case to the review group, detailing very closely the effects of this. Why can something not be done about that? I am sure very few carers become widows and it would be a very small cost to the State.</P>
      <P>There is another anomaly in the scheme, aside from the tax situation to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred. If a carer is living in and caring for someone in a local authority house, she gets the carer's allowance of £73. If her local authority rent is increased by £17.50 next week&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has highlighted the fact that there is inadequate information available on people with disabilities, particularly in relation to their numbers, characteristics and needs. However, the limited research which is available would suggest that, even before their special needs are taken into account, people with disabilities face a high risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Government is committed in its action programme to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed. Specifically, the Government is committed to overhauling the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities, to implementing the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The Government has implemented a number of recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in relation to income support, namely that the rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &ndash; CSW &ndash; be achieved as a matter of priority and a package of improved benefits be introduced for carers. As a result of the improvements which have been provided for by this Government, all payments to people with disabilities are now above the rates recommended by the CSW. Following implementation of the recently announced budget increases, payments for people with disabilities will range between 102 and 124 per cent of the CSW's target rate. In addition, the 1999 budget provides for the introduction of a major package of improvements for carers and people with disabilities costing over £18.6 million in a full year. They are improvements.</P>
      <P>Various studies have highlighted the fact that low employment rates lead to higher levels of poverty and social exclusion among people with disabilities. In this regard, significant progress has been made by my Department in recent years in relation to the employment and educational supports which are provided for people with disabilities. For instance, the back-to-work allowance and back to education programme, under my Department, have been extended to people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>In addition, the amount a person can earn from rehabilitative employment without affecting their entitlement to disability allowance, blind person's pension and supplementary welfare allowance has been increased from £36.30 to £50 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> While many improvements have been introduced in recent years for people with disabilities, it is nevertheless recognised that much more needs to be done. In this regard, the potential for further enhancements to the system will continue to be examined in the light of the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and having regard to the available resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to the duration of payment of child dependant allowances, my Department operates a number of payment schemes specifically for people with disabilities, namely the contributory invalidity pension, the means-tested disability allowance and blind person's pension schemes. Increases in respect of child dependants continue to be paid up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday, where the child continues in full-time education in the case of all these disability payments. This provision does not apply in relation to short-term disability benefit. However, a person receiving a disability benefit payment for more than 12 months can, as the Deputy knows, qualify for invalidity pension which is paid at a higher rate and, obviously, attracts extra benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>For three quarters of his reply, I thought the Minister was talking about another question altogether. It is typical of the filibustering attitude of the Minister in not replying to the question he was asked. I simply asked him his views on whether disability payments are generally made to low income families. I gather the answer is yes, but he might not even have confirmed that.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in why the children of those on disability assistance or benefit do not get the opportunity of going on to higher education because they do not get the child dependant allowance after the age of 18. Does the Minister not accept that system is wrong and that we should be encouraging the children of those on disability payments to go on to higher education?

It is the exception rather than the rule that they are not changed over to the long-term payment until many years have passed. Does the Minister accept that these are low income families and that it is wrong not to allow them the child dependant allowance to encourage their children to continue on to higher education? Will the Minister accept that if he continues with this attitude against people who are in receipt of disability payments, he will become know as the Glenn Hoddle of the Dáil? His lack of care for people in that position will fully justify him being christened in that fashion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows exactly what is at issue here, yet he is endeavouring to misrepresent the situation. Disability benefit is short-term and I cannot put it any clearer than that. Because of that, people in receipt of short-term benefits do not avail of some of the extra benefits available to those on longer-term payments. That has always been the case it was the case when the Deputy's Government was in power on this side of the House. I do not see any rationale for changing that because with scarce and finite resources one must target those most at risk from poverty. Those on long-term payments are more at risk of poverty than those on short-term payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if someone is on unemployment assistance or benefit, they can move on to a long-term payment after 15 months? That is not the situation with disability payments. The Minister and I have been Members of the House for about the same length of time. We often meet people in our clinics who are on disability payments and cannot get onto invalidity payment. It is very difficult to move from disability to invalidity. The Minister is aware of that. There is a very strict medical examination, yet many people are on disability benefit for quite some time. Would it not be only fair that they can receive allowances for their children in higher education?</P>
      <P>I fully understand what the Minister said concerning short-term and long-term payments. Perhaps there is a case to be made for disability benefit to become a long-term payment, or to have some system whereby children could receive special treatment. In reality, in most cases it is not a short-term payment.</P>

      <P>In this issue we are talking about people with disabilities I do not want to look at this purely as a matter of money. A huge number of people are on disability benefit. Their disability or sickness is of varying degrees, from the least disabled to people who have severe medical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> The Deputy is right in that after 12 months people are entitled to apply for invalidity pension. He is also right in that it is difficult to get onto invalidity pension. We all know that. One of the reasons many people endeavour to get onto invalidity pension is that they know that extra benefits are available. However, we have to look at this in a broader context. The Government is examining the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which contain some substantial proposals on extra payment for people with disabilities. The issue of some of the payments that are really designed as a sickness allowance, which we are committed to bring forward, is a broader issue. It is something we will be looking at in the current year. We propose to examine the issue of a sickness allowance which will assist in distinguishing people who are sick from those who have a disability and should be on invalidity.</P>

It is quite clear that the percentage of children of those in receipt of disability benefit or assistance who go onto third level education is very low. We should be doing everything we can to change that trend. Will the Minister accept that the fact the child dependant allowance is not available to parents of such children is a contributory factor? That alone should be a major reason we should try to change the system.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, was launched in April 1997 with the overall target of reducing the proportion of households in poverty from 9 to 15 per cent to less than 5 to 10 per cent by the year 2007. NAPS also set targets under five key themes: unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
      <P>In relation to the overall target, the Economic and Social Research Institute will publish a report around Easter on poverty trends between the years 1994 and 1997. This, along with other relevant reports and research, will inform the future direction of the strategy and provide us with the updated information necessary to refocus our efforts on those most in need. The introduction of poverty proofing also ensures that the NAPS targets are kept in mind as policy is being designed. The strategy is of ten years duration and targets will be periodically reviewed to reflect developments over time.</P>
      <P>With regard to progress on unemployment, for example, considerable headway has already been made towards the NAPS target of reducing the unemployment rate to 6 per cent by the year 2007. The average rate of unemployment for 1998 is estimated at 7.4 per cent. This also represents considerable progress towards the target of 7 per cent unemployment by the end of year 2000 set out in the employment action plan. It is the target of the Government to reduce it further to 5 per cent. Long-term unemployment for the period March to May 1998, the latest figure available, was 3.9 per cent with the NAPS target of 3.5 per cent almost achieved.</P>
      <P>Regarding income adequacy, the 1999 budget brought all rates of payment up to the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. It is intended, in the context of NAPS, to consider the issue of income adequacy in its broad sense, having regard to employment, taxation, budgetary constraints, etc. In this regard, my Department intends to examine the role of social welfare rates and the appropriate future direction of social welfare payments now that the commission's minimum rates have been achieved.</P>
      <P>While the NAPS targets for rural poverty and disadvantaged urban areas are framed in the context of the previous themes &ndash; educational disadvantage, unemployment, inadequacy &ndash; a range of specific actions related to the spatial dimension of poverty are also being pursued. The forthcoming White Paper on Rural Development will deal with rural development as a multidimensional integrated process. The paper will set out a statement of the overall objective to be achieved together with a broad policy framework and the institutional mechanisms to achieve it. Other issues such as rural transport, rural resettlement and farm incomes are also being examined at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Urban disadvantage is being tackled on a number of fronts, through programmes such as the area based partnerships, the URBAN programme, the national drugs strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund and the integrated services project. Revision of strategies that impact on poverty and social inclusion issues is considered each month by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs while the NAPS interdepartmental policy committee meets regularly to review progress on the NAPS. Any updating of the NAPS targets will, therefore, be considered thoroughly in these fora.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is fair to state that since the rainbow Government introduced the national anti-poverty strategy in April 1997, following which the Minister took office, he has not shown much interest in co-ordinating all the objectives across the territories he outlined? For example, in relation to income adequacy and the consistently poor, the Minister mentioned the reduction of the 9 to 15 per cent target to 5 per cent by 2007. Given the massive growth rates of recent years, is the Minster prepared to lower that figure further and reach it by 2002?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the spatial dimension of poverty and urban blackspots. Does he agree it is fair to state that the strategy on which the Government has embarked in dividing the country into two regions will mean that counties and districts, such as those represented by the Minister and me, and others, which are the most deprived urban areas in the country, will face massive cuts in EU support under programmes such as URBAN, horizon and their successors? The Minister mentioned rural economies and rural poverty.</P>

It is currently carrying out a survey of farm incomes. I am happy to be the Minister who assisted in bringing forward the farm assistance scheme which will help people with families with low income farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's allegation about NAPS. This issue is to the fore in my Department. The Government introduced one of the most significant and sought after ideas in NAPS, which was to poverty proof Government decisions. This is currently in vogue. The best way out of poverty is to provide people with jobs and that is what the Government has done. The unemployment target in NAPS has been almost reached and it is estimated the unemployment <Col N="879" /> rate will be down to 6.5 per cent this year. The Government has achieved this under NAPS.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government very much regrets that the Apple computer company has decided to cease production of its iMac computer at its Cork facility with the loss of 450 jobs. It is a severe blow to the workers involved and to the Cork community. I assure them that the full machinery of the State will be brought to bear on assisting those who are losing their jobs to find alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Apple was established in Cork in 1980 to manufacture personal computers. In July 1988 Apple Cork employed more than 1,900 people. However, notwithstanding the Tánaiste's visit to the company in the US in June last, the workforce has since then been reduced as a result of the closure of the printed circuit boards manufacturing operation and a reduction of its research and development and software activities.</P>
      <P>Production of Apple's new personal computer, the iMac, commenced in Cork shortly after its launch in August 1998. Apple has sold 800,000 iMacs since August 1998. It has been a very successful product. Apple's results from the first quarter of its 1999 fiscal year showed revenues up 8 per cent to US $1.7 billion from the same quarter last year. Profits were also up from US $47 million to US $152 million.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the IDA have made every effort to retain maximum employment in Apple, Cork. The IDA has had ongoing contact with key decision makers at Apple headquarters in California. This involved detailed discussions at a meeting between IDA's chief executive and senior Apple personnel at the company's headquarters in the US last week. I am convinced everything possible was done to change the company's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, Apple has decided to subcontract the manufacture of its iMac product to LG Electronics, located in Wales. This is part of a worldwide interlinked process in the Apple Com<Col N="881" /> pany to reduce costs. However, it should be noted that the Cork operation will retain the manufacture of the G3 desktop products. In addition, Apple are reviewing other functions that could be added to Cork. Possible new functions include investing in the assets to convert Cork to a &ldquo;configure-to-order&rdquo; plant and introducing finance and operations functions to support Apple's European operations and call centre activities.</P>
    <P>In considering investment locations, multinational corporations are strongly influenced by a range of competitiveness factors which a particular location may present and which are perceived by the multinational companies concerned to be critical success factors for any venture there. Locations must provide companies with the key factors which will allow them to continually create competitive advantage. These key factors can include, among others, good road, rail, air and sea communications; an advanced telecommunications infrastructure; a multi-skilled and eager workforce capable of flexibility and innovation; fair and rational regulatory regimes in the area of taxation; labour law and environmental standards and, sources of specialised training, education, information, research and technical support.</P>
    <P>Competition and a demanding sophisticated consumer base are also vital components in shaping, driving and sustaining companies' competitive advantage in the longer term. If companies are to prosper, be they indigenous or foreign owned, they must be underpinned by these key competitive factor advantages.</P>
    <P>Clearly Cork has many, if not all, of these factors in abundance, as evidenced by the success of the inward investment drive in the area. Nevertheless, it must be clearly acknowledged and accepted that in advancing economies, not every project can or will succeed. Projects can fail when they lose a particular and vital part of their competitive edge. This appears to be the case with Apple's current restructuring, which involves relocation to a lower cost production regime. According to the company, the main reasons for transferring the iMac production are transport costs, relatively high direct labour rates and the plant overhead cost structures. From Apple's point of view, LG Electronics, located in Wales, is best placed to undertake the manufacture because of its involvement in the design of the new computer and the fact that it supplies the translucent enclosure for the product.</P>
    <P>The skills profile of the people being let go varies, with the temporary workforce of approximately 400 being mainly semi-skilled operators. The others are from a cross section of support areas, such as management, finance and engineering.</P>
    <P>Every support will be given to employees at Apple to find new jobs. In this respect, employment prospects in Cork are positive at present. FÁS will immediately meet management and employees to undertake detailed skills profiles and plan training. Everything possible will be <Col N="882" /> done by FÁS to enhance employees' prospects for re-employment.</P>
    <P>Between 1992-7, the computer industry grew at an annual compound growth rate of 12 per cent per annum to reach revenues of IR £402 billion in 1997. Overseas information technology companies in Ireland employ approximately 47,000 people and account for 38 per cent of total exports. Twenty of the top 25 computer companies worldwide have operations in Ireland. Given the strong competition in the industry, it is inevitable that some companies will fare better than others and from time to time will be forced through market conditions to revise their manufacturing strategy.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland will continue to promote Cork aggressively for overseas mobile investment. The skills and experience of the Apple workforce should prove an attractive base for the new emerging jobs in Cork arising from recent announcements or potential new investment to the city. The years 1997 and 1998 were successful for overseas investment in Cork with 27 projects announced with a potential to create approximately 7,000 jobs. More than 1,000 of these jobs are to be filled this year.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Tánaiste announced a £10 million IDA supported expansion plan for the health care company, Nycomed Ireland based at Carrigtuohill, County Cork and the creation of an additional 150 jobs. This is a very significant new project. In the southwest region overall, full time employment numbers have increased by more than 25 per cent in the past nine years and by more than 10 per cent in the past three years. The numbers unemployed in Cork city have declined by almost one third in the past three years.</P>
    <P>This announcement is clearly a major blow to the workforce. I hope the generally positive situation of the Irish economy and the prospects for Cork in particular will lead to early re-employment of the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the jobs in question would be relocated in Wales and went on to outline the necessary requirements for investment.

What does he propose to do if this is the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors are involved here according to the IDA. The company referred to issues such as transport costs, overhead costs, relative wage costs and so on. The decision was clearly made in the context of restructuring. Ireland has benefited from the same process of restructuring with other companies in the past. For example, Rank Xerox decided to locate in Dundalk with the potential of providing 1,500 jobs. There are other factors involved in this situation such as the fact that the product was being half made in Wales already but the decision is a cost based one.</P>

      <P>The cost of wages is obviously a factor. The Department is determined to ensure that the 500 jobs referred to by the Deputy remain in Cork.

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State agree that workers at the Apple plant in Cork have every reason to be outraged at his remarks here today which amount to an apology for the Apple Corporation? Does he agree that savaging 450 jobs represents corporate treachery at its worst whereby the profits of a multinational are put before the well-being of workers and the community? Would he agree that the loyalty and hard work of the workers in Apple, Cork, has been rewarded by a kick in the teeth? Why were those workers left twisting in the wind over the weekend while media reports had it that this announcement was coming? The Tánaiste clearly knew it was coming but left the workers to the mercy of the media. Would the Minister of State agree, in view of what this company said last July in guaranteeing jobs for the future, that any more promises from them are worth nothing and it is time workers and their trade unions stood up and fought those job losses rather than letting these companies slip away quietly?</P>

      <P>It is undesirable that employees should hear through the media that their jobs have been lost, and I share the Deputy's concern that this happened. The Tánaiste has fought this issue all the way. She visited Apple headquarters in California last year in relation to the PCB situation. Mr. Seán Dorgan, the chief executive of the IDA, was there in the past week. There was an early warning before Christmas. What has happened is undesirable but it is our responsibility now to try to maintain existing jobs, to help the company to expand and increase the number of jobs, and to ensure that the workers are employed elsewhere and have the necessary skills. The IDA, and FÁS in particular, are putting plans in place as we speak to deal with those workers to ensure that they get an opportunity to work.</P>

Decisions are made that affect people's lives. We, as politicians and as a Government, have to deal with that and try to ensure that these people are re-employed. Statements made in the past about the future of iMac are on the record. The response of the Government at the time was one of appreciation and delight. It now falls on us to deal with a new situation. My net point is that the electronics sector is volatile. However, we have gained in other areas from the restructuring that takes place globally. We have to deal with the matter head on to help those who now need to be re-employed and to ensure that existing jobs are maintained.</P>

I am not convinced. Would the Minister of State agree that the company intends to move towards R &amp; D and move its manufacturing facility to low cost locations? Is the Minister of State aware of the low morale of the workforce in Cork? Is the IDA taking steps to match the skills of the 60 permanent and 393 temporary workers with the 1,000 job vacancies which have still not been filled by overseas investment companies about to locate in Cork in the next few months? If the company decides to close its manufacturing facility &ndash; the Minister of State mentioned a number of things they are planning in Cork which, as far as I can see, do not have much to do with manufacturing &ndash; will there be any sums repayable to the IDA? Will the Minister of State make a statement on the tax incentives currently enjoyed by the company?

If so, what was the nature of those inducements? Did we get an opportunity to discuss with the company anything that we might do to maintain those jobs? Is the Minister of State aware that in addition to the loss of those 450 jobs there will be many downstream and subsidiary jobs lost in the Cork region? Can he put an estimate on that?

      <P>I wish to pursue the point I previously tried to pursue about the remarks made by the Tánaiste on her return from meeting senior management last June. One firm commitment she gave on foot of that meeting was the assurance from executives at Apple that there would be further discussions with the workforce and their representatives before there would be any change at the plant in Cork. Will the Minister of State explain why that commitment to discuss the matter in full with the workforce, so that they would not have to hear about the loss of their jobs on public radio but through normal dialogue and industrial relations procedures, was not honoured? Will a task force, drawing on experience gained from, for example, the task force in Tallaght following the closure of the Packard plant, be established to facilitate those people being displaced in Cork to help them find alternative employment? We are being checked right, left and centre by external trade boards and job agencies. In this context, will the Minister of State instruct his agencies to ensure any inducements offered by the authorities in Wales are compatible with EU law?</P>

        <b>:</b> Is the Minister of State aware that there is a strong feeling in Cork that the Apple plant will be closed entirely in the future? Will he comment on this matter? Is he aware that last July the company's senior vice-president for world operations said the i-Mac computer could mean future growth at the Cork plant, describing it as the saviour of the plant? In view of these assurances, given only seven or eight months ago, why should the workers in the Cork plant have confidence in the word of this company regarding its future? Why should the workers have confidence in the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government when a multinational company such as Apple obviously believes it can walk all over her, treat the Government with contempt and, worse still, treat the workers with contempt&mdash;</P>

I also remind the Deputy of the type of job announcements which have been made in the past two years.

The evidence exists to show that new investment has been established for Cork during the lifetime of this and the previous Government. The opportunities for the workforce and the potential workforce in Cork are very good.

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy McDowell).</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mr. Roche:</i> When the debate on the Bill was adjourned last week, I mentioned that I had read with great interest the Minister's speech. He was correct to suggest that the heavy external burden of debt has had a devastating impact on the economies of developing countries in recent years. We all too frequently speak of the debt impact on Third World economies as if they were some abstraction, whereas they comprise unfortunate people who starve because of the debt problem.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with this Bill. I wish a different decision had been made by the Minister and I will outline my reasons for saying this. The lives of people in the Third World who have never heard of the international financial community, the financial order, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank are affected on a daily basis by these institutions and by decisions taken by mandarins in Washington, London, New York or some other financial centre. Their lives are directly affected by decisions about which neither they nor their Governments has a say. In this par<Col N="901" /> ticular issue, the IMF, the World Bank and the international community have focused attention on the problem the debt causes for the international monetary order. That is the wrong focus, and I wish the Bill took a different focal point.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the steps taken by the international community in this matter in recent years. He correctly pointed out that the 1996 initiative was the first debt relief scheme to seriously address the problems of Third World debt. I am concerned about the way it addresses the problem of Third World debt, which is from the focal point of the international banking community, the same discredited set of bankers who got them into debt in the first place. In the 1996 initiative, the World Bank and the IMF focus their concern not just on highly indebted poor countries but on those who have a track record in meeting debt. What will happen to the rest? Are they to be abandoned to their fate? The initiative focuses the international financial institutions on reducing the debt burden of the select group of countries which attempt to meet that debt. However, it does not take into account the social, cultural or demographic impacts of the steps taken to reduce debt. In some Third World countries, the effort to reduce debt means rudimentary public education and health schemes are cancelled.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I received correspondence from organisations, such as the St. Patrick's Missionary Society, which have a track record in the Third World. These organisations and the many Irish workers who have returned to Ireland from the Third World are deeply concerned at this initiative, and we should recognise their concern. Organisations such as the missionary society have a major interest in seeing the problems of the Third World debt assessed. Their focus is different from that of the international banking community in that it is from the perspective of the unfortunate people of the Third World. They understand better than any of us the burden of Third World debt. They witness the poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, continuing decline of communities, destruction of the environment and the abandonment of cultures which arise in the name of international economic orthodoxy. Missionary societies and relief workers have unanimously cautioned against the IMF debt initiative. On reaching the central point of their submission, I find their concerns in the issue are also mine. The real motivation so far as the IMF and the World Bank are concerned is not human suffering, destruction of human economies, poverty or malnutrition but the international banking order. Starvation and deprivation are far down the list of priorities. Their concern is the international banking community and that should be the last of our concerns.</P>
    <P>The institutions of international banking are as blameworthy in the matter of Third World debt as the rogue and tinpot governments that ran up the debt in the first place. Even a casual student of international economic development over the <Col N="902" /> past three decades could instance, without any difficulty, major capital intensive schemes that simply gobbled up billions of dollars. Many of these were tinpot schemes, put in place by tinpot governments and were funds for siphoning off the patrimony of the Third World. These projects swallowed money and in many instances produced no tangible results. The international bankers who put funds into these schemes knew from the outset the projects had little if any chance of success. The same international banking community was aware that the money which came in one door into a Third World country quickly exited through another door to be invested in numbered bank accounts in Switzerland or some other haven for hot money. The international banking community is guilty of near genocide in this matter in that gentlemen in suits in Zurich, London, Frankfurt and other major banking centres allowed themselves to become associated with regimes guilty of crimes against humanity. The international community should be much more willing to force the international banking community to face the real consequences of its actions &ndash; the concern of the IMF and the World Bank is to save the banking community &ndash; it should ensure the banking community learns a valuable lesson from the experience of the past few years.</P>
    <P>A few years ago Deputy Higgins and I had the privilege of witnessing a democratic election in Nicaragua. That country still suffers the consequence of a despotic regime that feathered its own nest, supported by the United States, and literally impoverished generations of the people of the nation.</P>
    <P>NGOs who have contacted me have asked why Ireland will not put the £7 million specifically earmarked for the fund into bilateral projects rather than into the fund itself. They point out that the IMF has not and never has been a development institution. I have some experience with the IMF. It is not a development institution. NGOs question whether the IMF has any real expertise or concern in this area. They are right to do so. These international institutions are good at looking after their own comforts and at spending large amounts of money on their own administration. We visited the International Bank for Reconstruction set up in London a few years ago where there was the scandal about the amount of money spent simply to furnish the lobby. We have proof of that. Their concerns are not always about the well being of the Third World. I share the fear expressed by NGOs that the IMF and the World Bank operate behind closed doors. There is little direct accountability for those institutions. This concern has been voiced by a number of NGOs here.</P>
    <P>Moving away from my specific concerns regarding the suitability of the IMF to carry out this work and from the culpability of the banking community, the governments in the First World should put more emphasis on debt forgiveness and I include our Government in that comment. <Col N="903" /> The bankers who walk themselves and their institutions into difficulties will not die if they do not get their pound of flesh from the Third World, but if they get their pound of flesh people in the Third World will die. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The financiers who got into this mess should be forced to carry the main burden. It is not just, equitable or morally defensible to expect the citizens of the Third World to carry that burden. I welcome what this Government is trying to do and what previous Governments have done in the Third World. Ireland has a good, although not a great, track record in the Third World. Would it not be a good thing if Ireland decides not to go with the general flow? While our failure to sign up to the ESAF would not bring the IMF proposals to a halt, it would certainly give some other governments cause for thought. I have already suggested this money should be used for bilateral aid. I reject the argument put forward here that bilateral aid necessarily causes problems for domestic economies in the Third World. The opposite is the case. Properly channelled, correctly focused and properly delivered bilateral aid, fosters economic and social development in the Third World. How can one feasibly argue that bilateral aid projects aimed, for example, at supplying farmers with seed or families with clean water interferes with the economic order or development of recipient countries? That is a nonsensical suggestion, yet I heard it trotted out twice on the last occasion we discussed this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty accepting the intellectual argument which was put forward regarding the advisability of unconditional debt relief or debt cancellation. The mandarins in the IMF argue that unconditional debt cancellation is not the right tool to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction in the Third World. They can do that from the comfort of Foggy Bottom, 17th Street, Washington. What do they know about poverty in those cosseted quarters? I do not believe this argument is intellectually sustainable.</P>
    <P>Let us put ourselves in the position of Ireland in the 1840s. If this country had a huge debt at that time and some external international body suggested the Irish people, who were then starving, should first clear the debt, how would we, at this remove, judge that application of economic orthodoxy? The Irish famine was due to misapplied economic orthodoxy. In this argument the same classic, economic, muddle-headed thinking that allowed millions of Irish people to starve is effectively being resurrected, polished off and put forward in a 1990s coat.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worth reminding the House, and perhaps even the Government, that many years ago the League of Nations was in session and the question of debt and debt cancellation arose. At that time the debate focused in part on the debt which was being imposed on the German people, the economic consequences of the peace. A few visionaries suggested that debt cancellation rather <Col N="904" /> than exotic formulae and alternative schemes were the appropriate way to proceed. John Maynard Keynes argued that the economic consequences of the peace ultimately was a further war in Europe. Another visionary who argued for debt cancellation was Eamon de Valera. He argued that at the end of the day the people who had to carry the consequences of the debt were not the people who were responsible for the issues which were being addressed by the debt. The world did not pay any attention to the views of that small handful of people at that time and we know the consequences.</P>
    <P>To suggest, as the IMF is doing, that it is good for Third World countries to take their medicine, put their economic house in order and get economic regularity into their affairs has a positively academic ring to it. The problem is that the academic and economic orthodoxy on this occasion is being borne on people who already live at the margin.</P>
    <P>I will not vote against the Government on this matter, but the issue itself and the manner we are going about it causes me grave concern. I was pleased when we put a moratorium on this matter a few years ago and I wish we were doing the same here. We in Ireland are in an unique position. We are a developed First World economy. We remind ourselves with sickening regularity that we exist in a Celtic tiger. It is a pity we do not have the intellectual self confidence to develop our own thinking on this issue. Ireland, as a developed economy, which was a colony, should identify far more readily than it does with the people of the Third World. We could and should be one of the leading nations to articulate the cause of the underdeveloped world. We could do that by not rowing in with every orthodoxy which flows from Washington or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>No doubt these measures will go through with the Dáil's approval and ultimately with the approval of the Seanad. I ask the Minister, however, to give serious consideration on Committee Stage to building into the process some form of regular review in this House or at least in a committee of the two Houses. If that arrangement were acceptable to the Minister, it would mean that we could be at least forced to focus our attention from time to time in a busy schedule on this matter.</P>
    <P>A Minister once suggested there were no votes in black babies. That cynical observation is probably true, but there is a moral imperative on us because of our experience and history to take the blinkers from our eyes and start thinking for ourselves on issues such as this. The IMF is not an appropriate body to deal with the development issue. The motivations of the IMF, the World Bank and the banking community are not pure or proper in this issue. I am cynical about their protestations of concern for the people of the Third World because in my brief experiences there I have seen no indication that the bankers care one whit for the people who live on the margin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> I ask the Minister to give serious consideration, before this Bill is enacted, to at a minimum providing some way to review the procedures over the next few years. It is fine for us to feel it is macho to play a big role in the IMF. In reality, we are minnows in a large pool and it would be much better if the minnows occasionally gave a little leadership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan, our spokesperson on Finance, pointed out, Fine Gael agrees in general with the initiatives in this Bill, the purpose of which is to make the payments authorised by the Government under the debt relief package announced by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs on 16 September 1998. The total package is £31.5 million over 12 years, £17 million of which is being paid up front in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, following consideration and extensive briefing from people who are particularly well informed about Third World debt, the Debt and Development Coalition of Ireland, which has been in correspondence with all Deputies in this House, we have serious reservations about the Government's decision to fund the enhanced structural adjustment facility. Because of the Government's decision to fund the ESAF, we cannot support this Bill in its entirety.</P>
      <P>Debt is a key burden in developing countries. That is directly related to the lack of social programmes in many countries. Important education, health and infrastructural development programmes cannot be pursued because of the compulsion to pay back large amounts of debt. In Tanzania, for example, 40 per cent of the population die before their 35th birthday and it spends six times more on debt repayments than on health. In Zambia, servicing external debt accounts for five times the expenditure on education. In Ethiopia, more than 100,000 children die annually from easily preventable diseases, yet debt repayments are four times the amount spent on health.</P>
      <P>When the debt burden is so onerous, agencies such as the IMF must be careful when taking measures to reconstruct the economies and budgetary accounts of such countries that the medicine is not too strong for the patient, that in trying to correct the problems in the economy they do make the poor poorer so that more children die, more children drop out of education, life expectancy is reduced, etc. Those of us who have visited Third World countries know most of these countries are not in a position to fund the provision of clean water &ndash; let alone proper mains &ndash; and sewerage facilities to basic standards which existed in Ireland two centuries ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a number of Members, including Members on the Government side, pointed out already, the ESAF programmes have many faults. In general, the aid agencies have three main concerns about the ESAF programmes which are shared by most Members. The proposed contribution to the IMF's ESAF programme is our main concern and it is also the main concern of the aid agencies. <Col N="906" /> The Bill allows the Minister for Finance to make further payments to the IMF and the World Bank beyond those detailed in the Bill, without Oireachtas agreement. I ask the Minister to clarify that matter which was raised by the aid agencies. There is no provision for accountability by the Minister to the Oireachtas on policies pursued by Ireland in the IMF and World Bank.</P>
    <P>In 1996, the Government decided not to contribute to the IMF's ESAF programme following representations from people around Ireland, especially the aid agencies. At that time the aid agencies raised concerns which still prevail today. Fianna Fáil, which was strongly against the proposal at that time, also raised these concerns. The IMF programmes undermine democracy. They are designed in the IMF's offices in Washington. IMF officials deal mainly with Ministers for Finance and governors of central banks. Elected parliamentarians and parliaments are bypassed.</P>
    <P>A further concern is that IMF monetary policies do not take into account human development needs. They result in a decrease in primary school attendance, increased malnutrition, the collapse of local industry and widespread unemployment. Across Africa, for example, there is no semblance of whole infrastructures which existed 50 years ago. As Members will be aware, society is collapsing in several parts of Africa. Much of this has to do with the way in which those countries have been manipulated, not only by outside investors and imperial forces, but by IMF policies. We should be wary of that. Another concern is that IMF conditions are so inappropriate and onerous that three-quarters of its programmes break down.</P>
    <P>That is why we are questioning the Government's proposal to contribute to the ESAF while cutting back on funding to Irish Aid. The IMF is not a developmental institution. This money could be used more effectively and in a more accountable fashion in Irish Aid. In the past Ireland has had a good record as regards aid, although we have probably not provided as much as we should because of economic problems here. According to my contacts with people who benefited in various ways from these programmes, many Irish aid agency programmes have been effective. We have certainly saved lives. Even the farming organisations' simple scheme to provide a cow to communities in parts of Africa has been effective in its own small way.</P>
    <P>As a nation, Ireland is inclined at times to be insular. In the past through our missionary zeal we looked towards Europe and beyond. However, we have now become more selfish. Overseas aid is not at the top of the list of priorities. We should adopt a more proactive approach and be more sympathetic to Third World countries. We know from experience that we can make a difference.</P>
    <P>The Bill authorises the Minister for Finance to make further payments to the IMF and World Bank other than those provided for. It is the view of the aid agencies that no contributions should <Col N="907" /> be made without the agreement of the Oireachtas. I agree. To ensure accountability Ministers should be required to place regulations before the Dáil for its approval. The current practice is to place them in the Oireachtas Library. The same should apply in this instance. Any contributions should be brought to the attention of the Oireachtas. The IMF and World Bank operate behind closed doors. There is no accountability to member states. To ensure value for money the Minister for Finance should be required to present an annual report on actions taken.</P>
    <P>Why should Ireland contribute to ESAF? Two years ago the then Government decided not to contribute in response to representations received. There was widespread opposition. Fianna Fáil condemned the proposal. It has now done a U-turn. What has changed in the meantime? </P>
    <P>The opposition of the Debt and Development Coalition is based on the negative social impact of ESAF programmes. The IMF aims to reduce deficits, not poverty. Human need is not a priority. ESAF programmes undermine democracy and are designed in Washington without reference to member states. They have failed to tackle the debt crisis. The debt burden doubled between 1985 and l995. This counters the argument put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>The role of the IMF in the HIPC &ndash; highly indebted poor country &ndash; initiative is unhelpful. Eligibility is linked to a six year track record in an ESAF programme. Given the high breakdown rate, the IMF is hindering debt relief, the provision of which in Tanzania and Nicaragua is being delayed because of problems with ESAF. The IMF is refusing to provide the necessary resources to meet its contributions. It has called for donations to cover the cost, even though it has provided billions to bail out private investors in New York, London and Berlin who lent irresponsibly in Thailand, Korea, Indonesia and Russia. It has access to large amounts of capital funding. Some of the £86 billion should be used to fund the work involved. Despite efforts at political level to report progress and present the HIPC in a positive light, it was stated in the <i>Financial Times</i> in November that the initiative was running out of steam.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to Third World countries. We all know of someone &ndash; a relative, neighbour or friend &ndash; working in the Third World as a volunteer, missionary or preacher. It is important that we support their efforts by providing as much as possible. We can afford to do so. We should target health and education in particular. The high rates of illiteracy are alarming and give no grounds for hope. The low health status of African countries, in particular, is also of concern.</P>

      <P>I oppose the Bill as it takes the State in a new and negative direction in dealing with the issue of debt, development and aid to the majority of impoverished countries in the world. I listened with interest to some of the contributions, including that of Deputy Roche who offered sound reasons for rejecting the Bill, but will still vote for it. As he prescribed, the minnows should give leadership. Progressive Irish opinion and tragic international need demand it. The minnows should vote against the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill takes us a further step away from independence in foreign policy. It should be rejected because it provides for contributions from this State to ESAF, the Enhance Structural Adjustment Facility. There is little knowledge and even less debate about the role of the IMF and ESAF. I commend the Debt and Development Coalition for highlighting the debt crisis and the role of the World Bank, the IMF and ESAF in compounding it, thereby causing untold misery to millions throughout the world. The Debt and Development Coalition is comprised of organisations and individuals who have worked for justice and development throughout the world. They are better placed than anyone else here to assess the real human impact of policies devised in boardrooms and parliaments far away from the impoverished communities who bear the brunt of the debt crisis.</P>
      <P>As the Debt and Development Coalition has pointed out, the aim of the IMF and the ESAF is not to reduce poverty but to reduce budget deficits. Human needs and the social impact of IMF policies are secondary considerations where they are considered at all. Conditions laid down by the IMF for borrowing countries are so onerous that over three quarters of programmes break down. The ESAF works to a monetarist agenda dealing with Ministers for Finance and governors of central banks in indebted countries. There is no democratic accountability. In spite of the aspirations in the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's speech, the ESAF remains unreformed. Yet he wishes to associate us with this programme which is compounding the problems of indebted countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of tying us to the ESAF the Government should be taking a political initiative and joining those countries that are calling for the cancellation of all outstanding debts owed by developing countries. This call was made by my colleague and the party president of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, when he visited Mexico last year. He noted then that the debt issue only became a crisis for the wealthier northern hemisphere Governments when Mexico declared it could no longer meet its repayments in 1982. The fact that for many years a blanket of poverty had descended on Latin America because of debt <Col N="909" /> concerned northern hemisphere bankers less than the prospect of a global financial crisis caused by developing countries defaulting on their loans to the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
    <P>At present the majority of developing countries are locked in a vicious cycle of debt which denies them the opportunity to improve the quality of life of those in greatest need. The voice of Ireland should be on their side, joining with them in the demand for cancellation of the debt and a hopeful beginning for the new millennium.</P>
    <P>In appealing to the Minister for Finance to reconsider this ill-conceived legislation I urge him to heed the words of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund: &ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of the developing world's children have given their lives to pay their countries' debts and many millions more are still paying the interest with their malnourished minds and bodies.&rdquo;  I appeal, however late, for a reconsideration of the Bill and I urge the minnows of this House to join with me and others in opposing it if that is the only course left open to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1998, the primary purpose of which is to give the Minister the necessary authorisation to assist in debt relief packages. I welcome the Minister's assertion that, given Ireland's strong financial standing, we must see ourselves as having a contribution to make in helping other countries to achieve their own development. Indeed, Ireland has always had a strong record, not just in terms of donations but always in the quest for justice. In this respect, great credit is due to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the many NGOs who have contributed to this. As a small nation in the early stages of development Ireland is in a unique position not only to understand the notion of empowerment and the importance of the old marine proverb that to give a man a fish is to feed him for a day but to give him a fishing rod may be to feed him for life. As a people to whom land is very important, we also understand, perhaps better than many, the importance of aid reaching the grassroots of society. There is a danger of environmental damage and human misery if economics alone dictate our actions.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that debt is a crushing burden on many nations in the developing world but it would be a mistake to see it as the only problem. There is a strong danger in equating economic growth with development. The IMF and World Bank programmes give rise to such concerns. These should not be underestimated and must be considered when discussing these issues. There is little point in reforming public expenditure if it is simply to increase the burden on the private sector and contribute to an unfair burden on the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If structural programmes are to work, important issues such as access and evaluation of the differential impact of the proposed measures <Col N="910" /> on different sectors of the economy must be studied. The question of control and decision must be paramount. Are those most affected by poverty, which we are attempting to alleviate, being included in the consultative process? There is little point in making decisions at official level which may not be sustainable at local level because of cultural, environmental or other such problems. Important also is the monitoring of programmes. Having contributed to the programme, what are the criteria for judging its success or otherwise and what means does the Oireachtas have for influencing the contribution or otherwise of such programmes? Given the requirement of efficient budgetary measures and constraints, the question remains whether Ireland's contribution of £31.5 million should be made via the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
    <P>There are a number of principal concerns. How successful are these programmes and by what criteria have they been judged successful? In many of the typical stabilisation and structural adjustment programmes, IMF packages have been shown to have better impact on the strengthening of financial and capital markets than on strengthening the capacity for public investment or improving supports for agriculture or industry. Without these types of improvements countries have little chance of development. The necessary infrastructure is vital to sustain real development. If economic growth is present it undoubtedly offers the possibility of repayments but only if that growth is in terms of Government income and not income to multi-nationals or to private bank accounts. Increased economic growth is desirable only if there is equality of access and if it is not based on exploitation or linked to environmental damage. What is the capacity of IMF and World Bank programmes to monitor these aspects? </P>
    <P>In terms of empowerment are the people involved with the result of debt being adequately consulted in its resolution, as Deputy Ó Caoláin asked? In Ireland we have seen important results from community development. We understand the necessity to involve groups at local level in everything from policing to economic renewal. Is there not clearly a greater need for representation at the IMF and the World Bank for members of developing countries on their executive boards? Is it not appropriate that decisions about programmes be made by them, with IMF itself becoming a lender of last resort? It may indeed suit borrowers to be in such a position.</P>
    <P>However, the fundamental remains. Many countries borrowed more than they could invest in hard currency earning enterprises. Since Mexico and Brazil first indicated in 1982 that their debt burden had become unsustainable there have been fears of instability of large private US banks and of countries themselves. What is less clear is how the management of this problem can be addressed. Debt repayment through structural adjustment programmes will do little to help if small niches cannot be found and if trade cannot <Col N="911" /> be developed. There is sufficient evidence to show that trade is vital. The European Union has an obligation to assist in the development of that trade. Where structural adjustment programmes can lead to further instability, particularly where there is rapid industrialisation or over-reliance on multinationals, we must question their long-term viability.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that IMF conditionality is based on the notion that it is not a development agency but a lending institution with a principal interest of economic stabilisation. As we approach the third millennium the vast amounts of capital provided by the IMF suggest that the policy reforms attached to IMF loans have a direct bearing on development. It is for this reason we, as contributors, must satisfy ourselves that these conditions are the result of participatory planning and the best type of development for the societies at which they are aimed. To this end, we must question the indications of development policies being used by the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked whether social and cultural needs are taken into consideration in the administration of programmes in debtor countries. Difficulties caused by armed conflict in Mozambique or by famine in the Sudan require vastly different approaches. Repayment of debt represents only one aspect of the requirement of development strategies undertaken by the IMF. Can those strategies address the social, political and cultural differences in all these countries? Given the varying political climates, it is equally reasonable to question whether we have satisfied ourselves that the benefits of development programmes will reach those in need and not simply those with whom we have negotiated. That is a fundamental point.</P>
    <P>Which are the countries judged by the IMF and the World Bank to be most in need of debt relief? Is it not true that debt relief is largely a Latin American aid? To what extent will it contribute to the development of Africa? Many of the world's most heavily indebted countries are in South America and Latin America. Neither the strength and use of the dollar as a reserve currency nor the current political climate have helped development. Has the Government satisfied itself that the Governments being helped by the IMF and the World Bank share the ideas of democracy and justice held by our people and that Ireland's contribution to economic packages will go only to those countries that share those ideas? I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, know that reflects the true feelings of our people. We must ensure Governments that benefit from IMF and World Bank programmes share our ideas of democracy and justice and it is on that basis alone that Ireland should contribute to economic packages for those countries.</P>
    <P>If development is to be encouraged, stability is a vital factor in any economy. The Irish situation <Col N="912" /> is a class example of this. The media have carried many versions of the debt crisis and have dealt with its causes and who is to blame for it. There can be no doubt that the developed world must carry its share of the blame. Does the cause of the debt crisis not include socio-economic factors, given national accounting, gender and racial issues? Has account been taken of the shortcomings of GNP as a measure of economic growth? Has the free market approach in issues, such as African rural development, been successfully evaluated? In the Berg report the World Bank rejected large-scale capital intensive Government projects. Is that adequately taken on board in structural adjustment programmes and are important issues, such as the development of small holdings, promoted? </P>
    <P>There appears to be genuine concerns that free market reforms insisted on by the IMF do not generally produce the results intended and that social and economic changes have been adverse to the increased productivity of smallholder farmers. In many cases the IMF has not promoted the necessary increase of national investment in agriculture and rural development. Have we satisfied ourselves that future programmes promote the development which the people of the developing world want? </P>
    <P>Is there not a danger that in promoting increased efficiency and productivity through revised expenditure, as in the IMF policies, important issues such as health and education may suffer? There was evidence of this earlier in the debt crisis when countries that received large adjustment loans between 1983 and 1990 experienced a decreased primary education enrolment rate. Ireland has ample evidence to suggest that the role of health and education in important in securing economic growth. Ireland particularly acknowledges the importance of the role of education. Many women are employed in those sectors in these economies where few other opportunities exist in the paid labour force.</P>
    <P>It does not make economic sense that a large flow of resources from the developing world to the industrial world can be seen as a means of stimulating economic growth. It was always understood that these debts should be reserviced only at the point of development when countries were in a position to export capital. The reality is that only Government and monetary authorities have the resources to reconcile the debtor nations with bankers, but debt servicing is only one small issue in development and other questions, such as the cost of imported food and other household needs, energy supplies, etc., badly need to be addressed. While the average debt service ratio continues to rise and to exceed total foreign exchange earnings, development in these countries is unlikely.</P>
    <P>Achieving the means to development is the challenge facing many countries in the next century. Despite Loire agreements, Africa went from being a net exporter of food in the 1960s to a net importer of food in the 1980s. We must accept <Col N="913" /> that CAP and other international agreements have not helped development, but equally solutions must be locally based and not imposed from a centralised bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Is a contribution to debt servicing Ireland's best route to assist development and not merely economics in its final goal? I particularly welcome the Minister's linking of debt relief to economic and social reforms and would be keen to ensure the criteria for identifying and monitoring such reforms would be part of a participatory process involving first and foremost those involved directly in the development process and also the donor nations in receipt of contributions at local level. Like some other Members, I received communications, and concerns were expressed to me about this matter.</P>
    <P>As this Bill progresses through the House we will have an opportunity on Committee and Report Stages to put forward relevant answers to the questions I and some of my colleagues have raised. I wish the Minister well in processing the necessary mechanisms and structures required to ensure the necessary debt relief package will come to fruition, but it is important to ensure it will be productive and effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this Bill. It is heartening to hear views and reservations expressed by Members on all sides of the House about the contents of the Bill. Despite those freely expressed views, it is regrettable that it is unlikely the Bill will be rejected on Second Stage. There are fundamental flaws in the Bill about which I am deeply unhappy and for that reason I will oppose it on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>This debate is in some way a continuation of last week's Private Members' debate on the Partnership for Peace initiative. I welcome the Government's change in direction in that regard. This debate is about finding Ireland's role in international affairs as we face into the next century. We must have informed decision-making in these areas. Taking into account the broken security infrastructures and the new ones that have emerged, the decision that was taken last week is important.</P>
      <P>The Government presentation of this Bill in the past week and this debate is evidence of us being shackled by international pressures to conform, when what is needed, in terms of the debt and development issue, is some new thinking. Taking an overview on this issue, one would have to conclude that we have failed to bridge the gap between the developed and the underdeveloped worlds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt in this Bill to dress up the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as international, friendly credit unions, as opposed to the international loan sharks they really are, is unfortunate. It is regrettable that the Government, given the lack of meaningful reform of these institutions, has changed the policy decision taken by the previous Government to put this measure in abeyance until the satisfactory oper<Col N="914" /> ational implementation of a comprehensive debt relief framework. There is no evidence of that today.</P>
    <P>I can recall the time of my political awakening in the late 1970s, when the Irish economy was in considerable difficulty. There was some talk at that time about whether the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund would be brought into Ireland, which was enough to send a shiver down my spine. I have not lost that impression of those two institutions. I recall the infamous address, which was recently republished, by the then leader of Fianna Fáil, Charles J. Haughey, in which he spoke of us living beyond our means. Presenting this Bill as being in some way good for developed countries is a hypocrisy and a sleight of hand with which we should have nothing to do.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the contribution by Deputy Roche, who made a very succinct argument. I understand his predicament, given the Whips system. However, there is no doubt the Government has no democratic authority to proceed with this Bill, on the basis of the freely expressed views of Members on both sides of the House. On the basis of that, I ask him even at this late stage, to reconsider the position of the Government in presenting this Bill without the very necessary meaningful reforms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche made a very good point, although I do not agree it is the case now, when he said that a former Minister said in the past that there were no votes in black babies. That is out of step with the thinking of Irish people today, when one looks at the freely given contributions of the Irish public on many occasions to disaster funds around the world. Our contributions <i>per capita</i> have been among the highest in the developed world.</P>
    <P>The Government is further out of step in its contribution to overseas development aid because we have frozen our contribution this year. To exacerbate that mistake by proceeding with this Bill, would be out of step with the wishes of the public. If one asked the public if it would give £30 million of taxpayers' money over 12 years and £17 million this year to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, one would get a very clear answer &ndash; the Irish taxpayer would say &ldquo;no, thanks&rdquo;. Given the unreformed nature of the Bretton Woods institutions of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the public would prefer us to use this money in a way in which we have direct control over it, by giving it in bilateral aid to some of the countries in which we are involved at the moment, and for us to have no more to do with these institutions until they reform themselves and have a meaningful development role in the countries in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>There is a new debate in Ireland, of which this is a part, on where we see our role in the international community, such as the area of Partnership for Peace, and how out of step our ODA contributions and this Bill are with publicly <Col N="915" /> expressed opinion. This Bill is morally indefensible and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>On Sunday night I watched Myles Dungan's programme, &ldquo;Divided World&rdquo;, which should have been compulsory viewing for anyone voting on a Bill as important as this one. It dealt very clearly with the graphic realities of life in a country such as Mozambique, which is among the poorest in the world, and how the institutions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are anything but friends of heavily indebted countries. After watching it, one could reel off statistics about the poverty levels, infant mortality, life expectancy, the level of investment by those countries in health and education, and the decaying environment in which people are obliged to live. It really made the case, to anyone with an open mind, why we should not contribute Irish taxpayers' money under this Bill.</P>
    <P>When countries find themselves held in such a stranglehold by these institutions that they have no way out, are unable to invest adequately in health and education, are unable to prevent 40 per cent of children under five years of age dying and are unable to raise life expectancy beyond 44 years of age, there is an inevitable political instability and an unending cycle out of which these countries cannot break. Any overview of debt and development in the past 50 years would see that we have failed the people in these countries and that this Bill will only perpetuate their suffering.</P>
    <P>I join previous speakers in commending the organisations which lobbied very effectively on this issue. We received some excellent insights into the realities. I also commend the RTE television programme, to which I referred.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of and question the close link between the Bretton Woods institutions and the foreign and economic policies of the major world players. These institutions are often used to achieve economic ends that are most advantageous to these major players, particularly the United States and the other G7 countries, which will have to revisit their moral standpoint on these issues. Serious questions must be raised about whether they are more interested in developing economic opportunities for their own countries or are genuinely committed to resolving the debt problems of developing countries in Africa, South America, Central America, Asia and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided in 1996 not to proceed with this Bill, the IMF carried out both an internal and an external audit of its operations. Both were equally damning, no matter which way one dresses them up. Previous speakers referred to the fact that more than three-quarters of the programmes financed under ESAF break down because there is very little bridge building between these institutions and the communities into which they are putting the finance and supposedly helping. There is an exclusion of civil society and parliaments, with many deals made <Col N="916" /> behind closed doors. The people who were interviewed on that programme on Sunday night were economists and representatives of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. There was a very cold and clinical approach to all this that was devoid of any humanity or concern for what is in the best interests of the populations of countries that are witnessing appalling circumstances.</P>
    <P>To justify the Bill the Government uses the fact that it is honouring its commitment. I repeat that there is no democratic wish in the House, as clearly expressed by the public on numerous occasions, for supporting institutions that do not deliver effective help to these countries. In recent opinion polls on the level of overseas development aid, which should have been given the buoyancy of the Exchequer, the Government was found to be offside as regards public opinion.</P>
    <P>The HIPIC initiative concerning heavily indebted countries under ESAF is another reason used to justify the Government's approach. However, the Minister would be wise to be aware of the views of the <i>Financial Times</i>&ndash; a publication which I am sure is more informed by the needs of investors rather that of recipient countries &ndash; which said the initiative had clearly run out of steam.</P>
    <P>Both the internal and external audit which took place gave no reason for confidence in putting in the amounts of taxpayers' money, proposed in the legislation, to the IMF or the World Bank.</P>
    <P>As we face into the new millennium there is a need to create development orientated institutions which seek to involve elected representatives and the broader community in countries to which they are lending financial support. The institutions should also take into account indicators of human misery such as lack of investment in education and health, life expectancy, infant mortality and the environment. These are factors that have to be taken into consideration in putting in place programmes for investment. A realistic view must be taken of the recipient countries' ability to repay.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that the system has been reformed and that these factors have been taken into account, but in reality the World Bank and the IMF have been forced to acknowledge that in the past programmes have broken down irretrievably. Basically, they will now take what they can get. Indebted countries are being bled dry by donor countries and consequently their population loses confidence in the political systems that govern them. This brings about an inevitable cycle of instability, insurrection, war, famine, death and deprivation. We need to break the cycle but the legislation before us is not an instrument for doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will oppose the Bill on Second Stage. I listened with great care to the speeches made so far in the House, particularly those from the Government side. Deputy Roche's speech made a powerful case <Col N="917" /> against the Bill. The only thing wrong with his speech was the Deputy's concluding remark when he said he would not vote against the Bill.</P>
      <P>I addressed a meeting of the Debt and Development Coalition following which I conveyed its views &ndash; and those of other organisations with which I have been familiar for more than 25 years &ndash; to the Labour Party which has decided to oppose this Bill. I do not intend to go back over arguments that have already been made in the House. I want, however, to make some remarks about what I think is a great failure that has occurred this evening and that is likely to happen in future. I cannot pretend to be cheered up by conversions to the cause of Third World debt or by people who have come on side. It is nearly 30 years since I first gave an academic lecture in monetary economics. My lecturing is as old as the gold standard.</P>
      <P>What lies underneath this legislation is not some simple principle of compliance with international commitments, which in 1996 the Government decided was powerfully posed by humanitarian arguments and by gross inefficiencies at the level of international institutions. There is a terrible hubris behind it which is reflected both here and internationally which is that economics reflects a kind of higher rationality, but, more important, that the higher rationality that constitutes economics is geared and driven by a version of the market place and by a series of compliant instrumental actions that will enable countries to advance their economic position. It is facilitated by a view of the economy as separated from a social and political setting, not to speak of a cultural setting.</P>
      <P>It is basically a depopulated economy drawn in its essential elements from versions of the western economy in the most ill informed and ignorant period in the history of economic theory. Bretton Woods was attended by people like John Maynard Keynes whose major work on employment interests and money was preceded by a volume on the philosophical purposes and moral obligations of economics, as was every other significant work in the history of economic thought in the English language, through Adam Smith and the theory of moral sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, economics as a subject was contextualised not just intellectually but morally. I wish to emphasise the point because it is not only in relation to the Bretton Woods legislation that we are paying an enormous price. We are paying an enormous price at home by being completely disabled by this crude, ignorant version of economics, this notion that there is a form of rationality that is superior in relation to financial matters, that is contaminated by moral concern and lessened by social connection. It is a junction that is being forced between economics and the other social sciences as disciplines and between economics as policy and the other policies that are practices. The price being paid for it is an inability to look at widened gaps in inequality at home or abroad, and every now and then to be put into <Col N="918" /> paroxysms by what we perceive to be the inevitable consequences of this disembodied economics.</P>
    <P>I speak as somebody who was an academic for nearly 25 years. It is a shabby time in economic thought when this type of technical practice is used as a substitute for theoretically, intellectually informed and morally accountable scholarship and discourse. That is what has brought the IMF to the point, at the end of the 1990s, at which it cannot survive an internal or external audit conducted on its own terms.</P>
    <P>Why have we not heard in this debate so far why the IMF's instruments are being used in contrast to any instrument used by the World Bank, which at least has the name of being a development agency? I do not intend to add another dozen rhetorical questions to those already posed and that is not a reflection on the present Minister. He is a man of immense personal charm but he is representing a kind of undertaker version of what was once a subject. This is not a subject, discipline or set of policies.</P>
    <P>I was present when one of the authors of this disastrous strategy of anti-human intervention in material affairs &ndash; the science of scarcity &ndash; was given the Nobel prize, as a representative of a version of the Chicago school of economics. I was also present in Chile after the plebiscite when the dictator was getting his final answer from the Chilean people, and when the people from the Chicago school arrived &ndash; los muchacos Chicago. They imposed their pernicious version of economics which had not been mandated or even tested at a meeting where people were asked if they wanted it. Long after I came home, I read that Chile was one of the successes of Latin America.</P>
    <P>I was in South East Asia and Vietnam, which suffered a blockade in relation to aid. It had an impossible relationship with the IMF. Last summer I was in Cambodia where one child in three dies at birth, another dies of malnutrition before the age of three and another child is seriously malformed by the age of five. Less than two children make it to the age of five and 87 per cent of the people do not have access to clean water. When I returned to Phnom Penh I listened to international reports about what the IMF was doing about Cambodia, Kompong Chhnang and South East Asia. The IMF was interested in saving banks. It was not interested in the people of South East Asia.</P>
    <P>I will not fall into the trap of suggesting that a small number of people are meeting in an unknown place and plotting the downfall of the great majority of the people of the world. However, I want to emphasise this matter because the evidence I have based on my experience is that we are acquiescing in a form of economics that is the least accountable in the history of the subject. It is on that principle that the IMF's current proposals in relation to ESAF are structured. It is a type of moral acquiescence. It would be almost easier to live if one did not know <Col N="919" /> the consequence of the actions. There are a number of stages; the first is to know the consequences and the second is to understand them. There is then a moral choice to be made about whether one will acquiesce with it and state that there is nothing we can do about these disembodied economics which are internationally expressed and structured through these instruments. The Minister must attend the meetings abroad and say something.</P>
    <P>This is a Parliament where there is supposed to be democratic accountability. That is the position here, but what does it tell us about our ability to do anything significantly moral internationally? Would it not be better if we were listening to an announcement that Ireland had taken a lead and was calling an international conference and would invite people to say whether they wanted to cancel or reschedule the debt? I am in favour of cancellation.</P>
    <P>How can people speak about foreign policy which is built on any consensual basis or any normative theory if people are being asked to pay their debt at the expense of health, education, housing, medicine and life itself? Perhaps people feel similar to the IMF man who was interviewed on television. One can deconstruct his statement until the cows come home, but he said that he would also like not to have to pay his mortgage. That is the crudity of the small minded, intellectually debased and rotten type of thinking that is at the core of these institutions.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking emotionally, rather in praise of reason, a rationality that is morally informed, an economics that is disciplined and policies that are built on a theory of interdependence and debated. People then would not feel ashamed about speaking about such economic policies being instrumental in theories that accept human interdependency. They would mean it would be unnecessary to say at the end of the debate that one is sure the Minister will listen to the views of the Missionary Union, the Debt Coalition and others. It is wrong in terms of fundamental principles. It is as wrong as those international terrorists who took the instrument of the marketplace in economic theory and sought to impose it as an ideological fact across every circumstance.</P>
    <P>One cannot have a market where people rely on GDP for the basic principles of survival. I do not suggest one should ignore the market. I accept the market as a mechanism of distribution, even of services in certain circumstances, but not its imposition as a fundamental principle where debts will be paid if necessary by life, education, health and clean water.</P>
    <P>The great exception to the great theory is that if life does not fit into the market, the sale of armaments does fit. What is the position in relation to the IMF going back to its drawing board and speaking about a levy on all those countries that sold armaments to the countries most in debt? Armaments help the balance of payments and the structure of the theory is that <Col N="920" /> what is good for the balance of payments must be good for the people. All that is necessary is to produce one generation of slaves long after another for the country's debt and somehow everybody will be better off because this madness was kept going.</P>
    <P>I recall making a documentary in Rio during the United Nations conference on economics and development when the most moving statement was made by Fidel Castro in a short speech. He said: &ldquo;Let us pay the debt to humanity before the debt to the banks.&rdquo;  Regardless of whether one agrees with him, it explicitly put the right to life expressed internationally above the right to debts. I was in Nicaragua when it was renegotiating its post-dictatorship debt. Mr. Xaibier Govostiaga was the negotiator with people from the institute of social studies at Den Haag in Holland. They got their loans from the international institutions when they agreed to take over the dictator's debts. They could not get one penny until they agreed to pay the dictator's debts.</P>
    <P>This is the end of the 1990s and it has been stated that an internal audit on the application of programmes will be conducted and that this will tell the institution something. It is supposed to satisfy us, but I am horrified. The time has come to pose fundamental questions about all these institutions. I share many of the views expressed about this matter. The point made by different people and organisations is that the Bill does not guarantee any accountability in the Oireachtas in relation to future contributions that may be sought by this institution which looks after itself. It is a plea for accountability, but even if that was not the case, the point is that the instruments chosen by the IMF are destructive socially and economically in terms of how they are applied to the people who are most affected.</P>
    <P>Another two shabby aspects are the inappropriateness of discussing giving money to this institution, which I insist can be described as I have done, at the same time as disaster relief funds are being cut and, second, the shift from the commitment to the UN target as a proportion of GNP to an absolute figure. I would make these points irrespective of who was the Minister for Finance. The time has come to say these things.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced by the Minister for Finance, not the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I recall the time when overseas development aid struggled to get in the front door of Iveagh House. Real people deal with finance and real economists are not theoretical but technosists. Sophisticated technosists work for the most unaccountable institutions abroad and when these institutions are forced to examine anything, they say they will do it themselves. If people get in the way, they will have another audit in another few years. It would be morally instructive and helpful if people said it had nothing to do with those to whom it is directed in Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. It would be better to say that it relates to the institutions. In a way, that would be more honest because there is no clamour for <Col N="921" /> it. I recall that Chile was used as an example one year and I understand Uganda is now the shining example. It has cut back on education to meet the requirements of the particular advances that have been made.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for the transmission of resources without any conditions whatsoever. I am arguing for Ireland to take an initiative which would go beyond the refusal of this Bill and put a question mark over international institutions in relation to credit. We should support those who are interested in achieving a rationality in economics and practising economic policy which would respond to the needs of, and deliver a surplus for, the international community. We should not allow ourselves to be victims of a bogus rationality which is as unaccountable as it is anti-democratic. There is a moral concern among people who know surpluses are available in this country and throughout the world and want them distributed in particular ways. They are prevented from doing so by the existence of a cast iron rationality designed to stop them intervening in a redistributive manner.</P>
    <P>In some of the worst pieces I read on economics in one of the banking journals, it was stated that spending decisions should be taken away from the Dáil altogether because we might be fickle about them. A former adviser to the ex-Taoiseach and current leader of Fine Gael was in favour of taking spending decisions away from Parliament entirely as we could not be trusted with them. That is an example of illiterate economic theory. Such a move would be bad economic practice, not informed economic principle. People are perfectly free to write that kind of material &ndash; which is something of a cross between weather forecasting and racing result predictions &ndash; but it is not economics or political economy.</P>
    <P>We are hearing the same old guff all over again here, whether it comes from the Chicago School of Economics or international institutions. There seems to be a belief that a kind of expertise exists which derives from a rationality that must not be unaccountable. It is accompanied by a corrosive cynicism &ndash; including the irony which sometimes contrasts Utopian models with the practices with which we are forced to live &ndash; which implies that some people know better than the public.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible to amend this Bill. It reflects an inability to go to the root of the institutions to which it suggests we make a contribution without adequate review and without an agenda on international debt which we might have pursued. The Labour Party opposes the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. We all recognise that we have an obligation to respond to the situation in the Third World. However, we have failed dismally over a number of years to respond in an adequate way to ensure we fulfil our obligation to the Third World and developing countries. I have visited some of the most remote areas of Africa and it is shocking to witness the standard <Col N="922" /> of living and services there and the level of suffering people experience. I recall an occasion on which I visited a small village on the Libyan-Angolan border and a sum of five Namibian dollars obtained some medical treatment for a very ill child who was suffering from nasty sores. That equated with 80p of our money and represented the difference between the child obtaining treatment and not obtaining it. If we had not had a presence there that day, the child would not have been treated. People do not realise how difficult it is to survive in many areas of the Third World.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to make payments authorised by the Government under the debt relief package announced by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs last autumn. The package amounted to a total of £30.5 million over 12 years, £17 million of which will be paid up front this year. In modern times, that sum is derisory. We could make all sorts of comments on where money is being allocated but we must question the allocation of a mere £17 million in debt relief in 1999.</P>
      <P>I am not focusing on the present Minister; previous Ministers and Governments have adopted a similar approach to the Third World. We boast about our missionary zeal throughout the centuries and our contribution to world peace but when it comes to helping the poorest of the poor, we are very slow to put our hands in our pockets and give adequate money. Given our history, we should be ahead of other countries in this regard.</P>
      <P>While Fine Gael supports the initiatives outlined in the Bill in general terms, the advice we have received from those who are well informed about Third World debt, including the Development Coalition of Ireland and former missionaries, is that there is an urgent need to assist Third World countries. Although I would question the role played by some former missionaries, they are keenly aware of the situation in the Third World. They are seriously concerned about the proposals contained in this Bill and the decision to fund the enhanced structural adjustment facility. In view of the Government's decision to fund the ESAF, the Bill should not be supported.</P>
      <P>One of the key burdens experienced in developing countries relates to debt. Debt is directly related to the lack of social programmes in many countries. In Tanzania, 40 per cent of the population die before their 35th birthday. The Tanzanian Government spends six times more on debt servicing than on the provision of health services. That is disgraceful and the developed world is allowing it to happen. On average, people in Third World countries have a life expectancy which is only half that of people in Europe. Yet we insist they pay six times more on debt servicing than on the provision of health services. In Zambia, the cost of external debt servicing is five times greater than expenditure on education. I have visited the outskirts of Lusaka and witnessed people starving. Many of them had to travel two miles or more for a bucket of water. A minimal amount of funding would allow water to be tapped on site. There was no funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Education is the key to improving a country's future. We have seen the response of this economy and our people to improvement in our education system. However, in Zambia the expenditure on servicing debt is five times that on education. In Ethiopia more than 100,000 children die annually from preventable diseases. Here again the amount of money spent on debt repayments is four times that spent on health. When the burden of debt is so onerous, the approach of agencies such as the IMF will have serious effects on the life opportunities and on the survival rate of the people of the Third World and in the countries it targets. In trying to correct the problems of the economy the poor will be made poorer, more children will die, more will drop out of education, and life expectancy will not increase but diminish. The ESAF programmes will be the main cause. The Minister should reconsider his proposals.</P>
    <P>Any series of measures proposed by the IMF which diverts resources from investment and human development, from infrastructure and the development of the economy into debt servicing, sacrifices people, their lives, their education, their health and any hope they have of breaking out of the conditions we as a human race forced upon them. It also stops future development. It frequently raises social tensions and causes conflict which has been evident over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Government will obviously persist with its proposals to fund the ESAF. The decision goes against the debt policy principles which the Government has announced. Recent reviews of the ESAF have been very critical. The IMF has not addressed the issue of the necessary reforms needed in the operation of this facility both in terms of ownership and in terms of its content. The Debt and Development Coalition is opposed to the Bill. The coalition of people involved in this seem to be the only body in Ireland, beyond the Department itself, who have an in-depth knowledge of the problems of debt in Third World countries. Certainly the hands-on experience of such groups, particularly in Africa, has to be taken into account. Their opposition to the Bill should not be ignored by the House. They object to the negative impact of ESAF. The International Monetary Fund aims to reduce deficits, not to reduce poverty. Human need is not a priority in the approach the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>There is also a strong argument that the programmes imposed by the ESAF undermine democracy, that they are designed in the IMF headquarters in Washington and then imposed on selected countries by bureaucrats who see figures and use calculators and ignore the impact they will have on people's lives in the countries with which they are dealing.</P>
    <P>One significant factor about the ESAF programmes is that they are so onerous and so inappropriate that three quarters of them break down. It has helped to justify funding programmes <Col N="924" /> which have such a bad track record. I call on the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    <P>The ESAF was introduced as a response to the debt crisis, and it failed to tackle the problem of debt crisis in Third World countries. Following the programmes debt has doubled in the ten year period between 1985 and 1995. The policy proposed by the Minister has been proved not to work. The internal review of the ESAF focused on progress towards achieving macroeconomic targets. Targets to reduce budget deficits or raise Government revenue were not reached. There was no real overall change in inflation levels, and economic growth rates remained lower than the average for the developing countries. The external review examines case studies and outlines specific mistakes that were made in dealing with economies which at best can be termed economies in transition, for example, Mozambique, where the IMF insisted that the State should divest itself of the ownership of most of the industry in the country. As a consequence 50,000 to 100,000 jobs were lost. Private industry was simply not interested nor ready to take up the slack of providing jobs for the people who were simply thrown aside. I am disappointed that the Government has decided to reverse the decision made by the Rainbow Coalition in 1996 not to fund the ESAF programmes. The external review recommended that the IMF should work with the World Bank in identifying in advance which groups may lose through the ESAF programmes.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the contribution to the Irish non-governmental organisations, Trócaire, Concern and GOAL, who have worked hard to assist the development of the Third World. I urge the Minister to seriously reconsider his approach to this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Neville said at the beginning of his contribution that he did not have the eloquence of Deputy Michael D. Higgins. Very few of us have the capacity to make such an eloquent case. Nevertheless, Deputy Neville made a strong and persuasive case that this Government should abandon this Bill. There is virtually no rationale for proceeding with this Bill. Virtually every aid organisation which delivers direct aid to countries that are indebted is opposed to the Government participating in ESAF. The case being made by Government in support of this Bill that it would seek reform once it joins does not bear scrutiny. The IMF had already undertaken an external review of how ESAF operates, and the report is devastating. It is nonsense for this Government to put what little money it provides for aid into a scheme which will result in deeper poverty and social disintegration in those countries we are seeking to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Derek McDowell opened the debate for the Labour Party on this Bill, he read into the record an amendment whereby we indicated that we would oppose this Bill on Second Stage. I hope that Deputy Roche on the Fianna Fáil side, who also spoke very eloquently in oppo<Col N="925" /> sition to this Bill, will continue to lobby. I honestly do not expect him to vote against his party. It is a rare occasion when I can praise Deputy Roche because he rarely says anything in this House with which I agree. However, the speech he made this evening on ESAF was one which I fully support. I hope he continues to lobby within the Fianna Fáil Party to have this Bill withdrawn, because there is no rational basis for it proceeding beyond the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the current Government to respond effectively to the crisis in the Irish housing market; notes that:</P>
      <P>there has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of applications for local authority housing since the last housing assessment in 1996; couples on average incomes can no longer afford to purchase a typical starter home as house prices have increased dramatically; rents in the private rented sector have spiralled; the number of homeless persons continues to increase; and calls on the Government to:</P>

    <P>abolish stamp duty on second-hand houses for first time buyers; increase the first-time buyer's grant; establish a national housing commission; establish a cabinet sub-committee on housing, chaired by the Taoiseach and consisting of the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children, Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs; transfer the administration of the rental subsidy scheme and the mortgage supplement scheme to local authorities; dramatically increase the provision of capital assistance to local authorities to allow 10,000 housing starts each year for the next four years and to substantially increase the capital assistance scheme for the voluntary housing sector; bring forward a comprehensive national strategy to deal with the issue of homelessness with the Department of the Environment and Local Government taking overall control for the direction of policy in this area; review the 1992 Housing Act so as to increase the rights of tenants and to provide incentives for the private rented sector to develop longer term leases; increase housing density, particularly in areas close to transport corridors, and to ensure a mechanism of enforcement by the Department of the Environment and Local Government on appropriate <Col N="926" /> local authorities; introduce legislation ring-fencing development levies for the use of community projects in new developments; complete as a matter of priority an audit of all State-owned lands so as to increase the availability of such lands for social housing; introduce legislation to ban the practice of gazumping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this motion on the basis that it includes the essentials of a policy document which Fine Gael recently published on housing, entitled &ldquo;Affordable Housing for All&rdquo;, which sets out to deal with the multiplicity of issues that face us in dealing with housing our people. We have a housing crisis, and a measure of its depth and gravity is that some commentators seem to be taking comfort from the fact that in the most recent period for which estimates are available the rate of increase in new house prices has declined to &ldquo;only&rdquo; in the region of 30 per cent. At a time when general inflation rates are less than one-tenth of that level there is clearly something amiss in the housing sector. If commentators can take some encouragement from the fact that the rate of increase in house prices has declined to 30 per cent, over ten times the level of general inflation, it is clear we have a major crisis on our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last housing assessment was done in 1996 &ndash; it beats me why one is done only every three years &ndash; the number of applicants waiting for local authority rented accommodation has risen from 26,000 to over 40,000. Indeed there is some indication that the figure may now be closer to 50,000. Even a figure of 40,000 represents an increase of 16,000 in the number of outstanding applications for local authority rented housing in just under three years. Last Thursday the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, told the House that he expects 3,700 of these applications to be met by new housing completions by local authorities this year and that he expects a further 3,900 will be met by vacancies in the existing stock of local authority houses. Therefore, with over 40,000 applications on the books, the Minister expects that around 7,600 can be met this year. In other words less than one in five of the applicants will get a local authority rented house this year. Four out of five of these applicants will have to wait even longer. Not only that, but they will be joined on the waiting list by a substantial number of new applicants during the course of the year. I do not know what that number will be &ndash; nobody can foretell &ndash; but looking at the current increase in the rate of family formation, something we are all glad to see, demographic trends which show an increase in population, other factors in the population and economic factors which I will discuss <Col N="927" /> later, it is clear that by the end of this year housing waiting lists will still be a major problem.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday the Minister told the House that the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme is expected to provide 450 homes this year and that shared ownership would provide a further 1,200 homes. I would like to know how many of the people who have applied for participation in those schemes are still waiting and how many will find that their needs are not catered for again this year and will still be waiting at the end of the year?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spent some time in the House last Thursday clapping himself on the back for making more money available this year than has been made available in previous years to provide local authority houses. What he said is incontrovertible &ndash; the figures show that more money is being made available this year than last year. However, the increase in funding and the number of housing starts is simply not keeping up with the need. We are falling further and further behind. Thousands of families all over the country are suffering from overcrowding, with all the frustrations, family tensions and health problems which overcrowding entails.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of the Government's response to the housing crisis is in a real sense contributing to the reality of social deprivation and is laying the foundations for further social deprivation, marginalisation and all their attendant evils in the future. There is nothing to be proud of, and the self-congratulatory stance of the Government, the Minister and in particular the Minister of State, is nauseatingly irresponsible in the face of the crisis which confronts us.</P>
    <P>The problem does not stop there. A new element has come into the picture of housing needs in recent years. There are people now seeking local authority housing and participation in social housing schemes who only a few years ago would never have figured in that equation. They are young couples, many of whom are starting out in their marriages, who in previous years would have had the ambition to buy a starter house even if they were put to the pin of their collar to pay for it, as most people are when they start off. Many couples, even in cases where both are working, as is typical today, now find the purchase of even a modest house way beyond their reach. A person on an average wage who borrows up to the limit of his or her capacity will still be at least £50,000 short in attempting to buy an average starter house in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A typical young couple with no children on an average level of income will find it almost impossible to buy a starter house. A couple with one income and a child or children will find it impossible. A married couple on average wages with children will find it virtually impossible to buy a house and pay for childminding facilities at the same time. It is regrettable that in spite of the expectations built up, and possibly fuelled from the Government benches before this year's <Col N="928" /> budget, nothing in any real sense was done to help young couples with childminding and nothing was done to help improve the level of service provision for people who need assistance in childminding, if only to be able to afford to buy a house. The result is that the problem which already existed got bigger and will continue to get bigger and bigger. All this adds to the pressure on local authorities to provide housing, and the allocations made by the Government to local authorities, increased as they are, are nowhere near adequate to deal with this new dimension of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for housing for lone parents, typically for single mothers. Sociologists, psychologists, and I see from one of the Sunday papers, reconstructed apostate feminists, may argue about the causes of this phenomenon and the legitimacy of the problem as one requiring our attention. Indeed it looks as if they will argue about it interminably. The problem exists and the demand and needs exist and must be met.</P>
    <P>We got a foretaste of the Government's approach to the problem during the 1997 general election. We remember the soundbite of the Tánaiste &ndash; that noted soundbite addict &ndash; in what must have been one of the most callous, hard-hearted contributions to political debate. In one of the policy positions most devoid of any compassion or understanding, she proposed that part of the lone parent's allowance should be re-routed, as she called it, into encouraging single mothers to stay at home and raise their children with their own families. She was seriously proposing that thousands of Irish children should be born and raised in the boxroom of their grandparents' house, frequently in seriously overcrowded conditions, often in an atmosphere of serious family tension and always without the advantage of being raised by a mother who has her own space to give her child the best upbringing she can. I very much fear that an element of that attitude may have persisted and may underlie Government policy. Mercifully, as it turned out, we were spared the gross inequity of that heartless re-routing policy. The fact remains, nevertheless, that the inadequacy of local authority housing provision today condemns many mothers and their children to the type of life I just described.</P>
    <P>The number of homeless people continues to increase. We may argue long, hard and wisely about how that problem arises. It is, nevertheless, a fact. The number of people sleeping rough and seeking shelter is increasing. The number of young people, by which I mean teenagers and even younger, sleeping rough and seeking shelter is increasing. Most of the response to this need is provided by voluntary organisations. The public contribution &ndash; the Government's contribution &ndash; to dealing with this problem is nowhere near the measure of what is required and the result is more and more human misery and deprivation.</P>
    <P>It is all the more deplorable because we, in this House, went to the trouble some time ago of leg<Col N="929" /> islating again on how to deal with and define homelessness. In that legislation, we placed an obligation on housing authorities to deal with the problems of people who, under the definitions of the legislation, become homeless. Having done that, we failed utterly to give local authorities the resources to match the obligations we put on them. The result is that the greater part of the response to the problem of homelessness is provided by voluntary organisations and by individuals, some of whom are people with a mission and all of whom make clear the fact that they cannot continue indefinitely to provide the service they provide and that they cannot, even now, meet any more than a relatively small proportion of the needs they see daily and, indeed, nightly on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>More and more people find that purchasing their own accommodation is not an available or a realistic option. Many people find that buying a house or an apartment is way beyond their reach. There are many other people who are at a stage of life where the purchase of accommodation is not a relevant or necessary condition. Many people decide they simply do not want the burden of a mortgage and feel other options are more relevant. All these people look to the private rental sector to meet their needs. All these people now face increasing difficulty and ever rising rents.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to suggest that the surge in house prices in recent years has led some proprietors, who formerly let their houses in flats or bedsits, to reconvert them into single family dwellings and put them on the market to realise a substantial capital gain. There is evidence to suggest that the provision of new rented apartments has been discouraged by some of the action taken by the Government on foot of the Bacon report. I have always believed even in the days when it was not popular or fashionable to do so, that the tax incentives to those who purchase and let apartments were extraordinarily generous and contributed to a very inefficient allocation of resources in the housing market. The present Government's action in reducing these incentives in an already overheated housing market was surely one of the prime examples in recent years of bad timing and pro-cyclical action. The Government's action reinforced a trend already present in the market and has caused difficulty for a great many people.</P>
    <P>The increase in rents has affected the whole rental market from high priced luxury accommodation to bedsits and everything in between. It has had a substantial impact on household budgets for tenants and on the demands made on health boards for rental subsidies.</P>
    <P>The surge in house prices and the incoherence of the Government's response to it has revived the myth that there is somehow something evil about those who provide private rented accommodation. Rented accommodation, whether it is in the form of apartments, bedsits or houses, will always be needed. We will, therefore, always <Col N="930" /> need proprietors of accommodation available for letting. There is, however, a need for regulation of the terms of lettings.</P>
    <P>We have some legislation in place but all the evidence indicates &ndash; evidence given by the Minister of State in response to questions in this House &ndash; that action to implement the legislation and ensure observance of its requirements is lamentably deficient. It is clear, for example, that the requirement to issue tenants of rented accommodation with rent books is more honoured in the breach than in the observance. It would be a reasonable guess that a majority of tenants in private rented accommodation do not have a proper rental agreement. There are grounds to believe that many private rented dwellings fall far short of even the most rudimentary safety standards. I suspect there is only a very imprecise record of just how many private rented units there are. There is a clear need for more vigorous action to apply the legislation we have in those areas. If it is not being done by the authorities on whom the obligation has been laid by the legislation, it is up to the Government to make sure they do their job.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a great potential for private rented accommodation to become an even more important factor in the housing market than it is today. To that end, we need a proper legislative basis, and that is one of the things for which this motion calls. That will be an increasingly important element in the housing market in years to come. It seems to me if we look at the pattern of neighbouring countries, that as average levels of disposable income increase and as mobility of people in jobs increases &ndash; that has become a feature of our jobs market these days &ndash;  there is a growing demand for rented accommodation for people who are moving around and for people who want to use their disposable income for reasons other than a mortgage.</P>
    <P>There is no reason we should not have a well regulated transparent market in private rented property in exactly the same way as exists in many other countries. One does not have to look far for examples where the tenant of rented accommodation is provided with a measure of certainty and stability which is most uncommon in our system. In Belgium, for example, one of the best known things in the rented accommodation market is what is called the three six nine system. One gets a lease which is ultimately for nine years and is reviewable every three years. After three years both the tenant and the landlord have the option to get out, and that applies right across the rented market. It gives tenants a security and fairness of treatment which is, by and large, not available to tenants of private rented accommodation in this country.</P>
    <P>I set out the main features of the housing crisis which faces us today but have not, by any means, described all the difficulties, and some of my colleagues will deal with other aspects of it. The list of the problems is long and varied and a variety of remedies is called for. To resolve the problems, <Col N="931" /> the Government, many official agencies and a large number of private and community based organisations will have to work constructively together &ndash; they all have a part to play. It is incomprehensible that in the face of the diversity of the problems and the variety of the actions required, the Government still refuses urgent and well-founded requests by the Opposition and a multiplicity of agencies and groups outside the House to establish a national housing commission to draw together and integrate the diverse responses needed to deal with the housing crisis which has such far-reaching social and economic implications for people in all walks of life, particularly for people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government's refusal to establish such a commission amounts to nothing more than a nonsensical claim that the Government is the repository of all wisdom in these matters, and that is patently absurd. We know from practical everyday experience that community and co-operative efforts and very often the work of dedicated individuals have all helped to meet some of the pressing housing needs of different groups in our population, even if only in part. It is equally clear that without the efforts of ordinary organisations and individuals like these, a great many people would suffer even greater hardship than they do today and even more people would suffer hardship than is currently the case. It is stupidly irresponsible of the Government to refuse to allow those organisations and people to participate fully in the definition of a concerted response to the housing crisis as proposed in the motion before the House tonight. I call on the Government to mend its hand, reverse its unreasoning stance on this issue and proceed immediately to set up a national housing commission.</P>
    <P>The responses we make to the housing crisis will have repercussions on other issues that claim our attention. We can plan housing in a way that will help to alleviate the major problems of traffic congestion that we face in our cities. In that way we can secure a double benefit for the quality of life of our people. There are opportunities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway for a new housing provision in city centre areas. There are opportunities for a higher density of housing in such areas that we have sometimes applied without replicating the mistakes of ultra-high density housing perpetrated on other cities. There are opportunities of integrating high density housing and developing transport corridors to make it easier for people to move to and from their places of work, education, recreation and their homes. This motion calls on the Government to do that.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to adopt an integrated approach to the resolution of the housing crisis as set out in this motion and to accept that the simple repetition of statistics of expenditure is not a response to those people who will wait in vain throughout the remainder of this year for an answer to their housing problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dukes on putting down this timely motion. When some issues are debated in this House many members of the public are not familiar with the topic. That is not the case with respect to the housing crisis. In almost all the contributions on the budget, the difficulties that now pertain in this area were alluded to and it has become a common topic of conversation among all sections of the population as we hear more and more hard case stories.</P>
      <P>The Government sought to buy time on this issue and commissioned the Bacon report. In the process of all the discussions on the matter, it used the Bacon recommendations as a defensive mechanism but matters continued to get worse. In County Wicklow, there are more than 2,000 applicants currently on the housing waiting list; in a conservative estimate this could represent 5,000 people. A visitor to this country might be forgiven for thinking that some sections of the tourism industry have reached into every lane and corner as they view the many mobile homes that now dot our landscape. It is difficult to explain why so many young children have to spend cold winter nights in such conditions when we can boast of a £1 billion budget surplus. It appears we now have a Government with no social conscience.</P>
      <P>Fortunately for the Government, it is often the council official who must carry the can for a Government which has granted a mere 182 new house starts for County Wicklow in the last year of the millennium. This pales in comparison to the poor years of the mid-1980s when house starts reached 300 and 400 during the term of the then Fine Gael-Labour coalition.</P>
      <P>The condition of many local authority houses has been allowed to deteriorate to a very poor level and the inhabitants of many of these estates have become demoralised as they see themselves continually pushed to the margins. During the debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, drafted to implement the recommendations of the Bacon report, my party recognised the serious difficulties that would arise in the rental sector if investors were discouraged from purchasing property. We put down an amendment that would have dealt with the difficulty but our worst fears have now come to pass because, due to a shortage of supply, landlords in many cases now charge inflated rents. This is happening at a time when mortgages continue to decrease.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes brought forward a Bill to deal with the problem of gazumping and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, when outlining his reasons for not accepting it, spoke of Article 43.1.2 of the Constitution which deals with property rights. He was selective with the use of the Article when he said the Bill would interfere with those rights. If the Minister had continued to read Article 43 he would have seen that Article 43.2 states: </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, <Col N="933" /> to be regulated by the principles of social justice. The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>A Supreme Court judgment in 1957 in the Attorney General <i>v. </i>Southern Industrial Trusts case referred to Article 43, private property rights, and the assessment of what the common good required. That judgment stated that those were &ldquo;matters primarily for the consideration of the Oireachtas&rdquo;. In 1970, Mr. Justice Kenny, in the case of the Central Dublin Development Association <i>v. </i>the Attorney General, stated that among other things, when dealing with these Articles, the exercise of these rights ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice. He also stated that the State may, accordingly, by law restrict their exercise with a view to reconciling this with the demands of the common good, yet we still have a Government that fails in its responsibility and chooses instead to let the building industry regulate itself.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to deal with, one of which is in respect of the building regulations. Are these regulations being implemented or are they being left to the financial institutions to implement? What happens when cash developers build buildings? I am concerned that in the future several buildings may be seen to be of inferior quality. Is the Department of the Environment and Local Government doing anything about this? I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has failed to tackle the real problem of housing. With a 60 per cent increase in the number of applicants since the last housing survey in 1996, it is obvious that more young couples are being forced to apply for local authority housing owing to the escalating house prices. Young couples starting their lives together cannot even contemplate buying their own homes unless both partners have secure, well-paid jobs. It is evident also that parents cannot afford the large mortgage repayments due on their children's houses. Spiralling rents have added to the housing problem. In some cases young couples are living in substandard rental accommodation with poor ventilation, no heating and inadequate sanitary facilities.</P>
      <P>To address this problem the Government should immediately abolish stamp duty on secondhand houses for first time buyers. Surely it is not too much to ask a Government to play its part in that respect and give those beleaguered people who are trying to buy a home an opportunity to acquire that home without the Revenue Commissioners insisting that stamp duty be paid on secondhand houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new house grant for first time buyers should be increased from £3,000 to £10,000 because £3,000 is peanuts when one is constructing a new house. That sum has not changed in ten years when the price of building houses was <Col N="934" /> one-tenth of what it is today. Surely it is not too much to ask the Government, in this day of the Celtic tiger economy, to increase the new house grant to £10,000. The stipulation that applicants for new house grants must submit receipts for labour costs of £6,000 if they build their own house should be abolished. It would be sufficient for such applicants to submit VAT receipts for £16,000 because many of these people are working in the building trade and can do much of the work themselves, yet they must show receipts of £6,000 from a qualified builder. That is ridiculous. That scheme is bedevilled with red tape and the sooner the Minister fine combs it, the better.</P>
    <P>The Government should introduce legislation to compel builders to adhere to the original price quoted for a house. They should not be allowed to escalate the price when the estate is sold. If builders are prepared to sell a house for £70,000 on the first day and they have 100 houses in an estate, they should be compelled to sell each one at the same price instead of raising it when there is a huge demand for the houses.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Government to introduce legislation to ban the practice of gazumping, which has become widespread. It is pushing up prices on poor, unfortunate people trying to buy a house. When they try to buy a house, auctioneers tell them a higher bid has been made. This leads to a stampede to buy and the price increases significantly. Either people are outbid or they are saddled with an exorbitant price for a property which they should not have to pay. The time is right for the Minister of State to step in to ensure common sense prevails.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is only skimming the surface of the problem. The Government should wake up and become more aware of its obligations. Local authorities should be encouraged to purchase secondhand houses to clear the waiting lists. If the problem is not tackled now, it will worsen to the point where, by the end of the next decade, it will be so huge, no one will own their own house.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the most extreme example of the housing crisis lies less than 100 yards outside the gates of Leinster House. Instead of getting into his car this evening to go home, if the Minister of State were to walk for two or three minutes outside the gates of Leinster House, he would see people lying in doorways, wrapped in filthy and often soaking wet blankets. I see them every second night I stay in Dublin. That is unacceptable in today's society and is something the Government has done nothing to tackle. I assume the Minister of State is aware that the number of homeless people in Ireland is increasing annually. The more worrying statistic is that the average age of homeless people is decreasing annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing of these people is more than just putting a roof over their heads. They are the weakest and most vulnerable people in society, and the State has a responsibility to care for <Col N="935" /> them. The only way the vast majority can possibly rebuild their lives is to start living a normal life with a roof over their heads. In a sample of 153 homeless people around the country, 65 per cent had drink problems and 40 per cent had mental or psychiatric problems. Almost 50 per cent of them have been in hospital for a long period of time in the past five years, adding to the problem of hospital waiting lists, and 20 per cent had been released from prison in the past five years and were likely to return, from what I have been told.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that, adding to this problem in the second largest city in the country, Cork, which is in my constituency, is that there is nowhere for a homeless young boy under 18 to go because no shelter is available for him? Before Christmas, a 17 year old boy came to my constituency office saying he had run away from home for reasons about which he would not tell me. He told me he could not go home and asked where he could stay for two or three nights while he was sorting himself out. I could offer nowhere because there is no shelter for boys under 18, and males comprise the vast majority of homeless people. I would like the Minister to do something about that.</P>
    <P>House prices are an issue of particular relevance to me as they are to so many people in my age group, between 25 and 30. Many of us want to buy a house but we cannot afford it. The average house price in urban areas in Ireland is close to £100,000. That is an increase of 30 per cent every year for the past three years, despite the fact that 42,000 new houses were built last year. The Government has a responsibility to ensure first-time buyers have an opportunity to buy houses. To do that, Fine Gael proposes that stamp duty for secondhand houses be abolished, that county councils be given funding so they can provide serviced sites, especially for first-time buyers, and that first-time buyers' grants be increased dramatically from £3,000 to £10,000. Some 46,000 families are seeking houses at the moment and the Minister of State proposes to provide 7,000 this year. Where is his social conscience, because I cannot see it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight two items which I believe to be the major barriers to increasing the supply of housing and which consequently require the urgent attention of Government. As a move is made towards providing additional housing, especially in higher densities, there is a need in the existing and newly built-up areas of Dublin for certain basic infrastructure, some of which has a very long lead-in time, such as a water supply or sewerage scheme, even when it is under construction. It is the time taken for planning, that is, to move from the point where the local authority identifies the strategic need, such as a water supply, to the point where the Department accepts it might be telling the truth, which is the problem. There is little point in the Minister instructing Department officials, as is <Col N="936" /> the case in the current crisis, to contact the Dublin local authorities on an almost weekly basis to know what they are doing about the housing crisis if there is no water supply. Whatever about moving people into new areas without a bus service being provided in advance by Dublin Bus, for example, there is no possibility of moving people into houses without a water supply.</P>
      <P>This lack of basic infrastructure is the major constraint on the ability to respond to the housing crisis. There is an urgent need to establish a planning protocol between the local authorities and central Government to ensure clearly identified, regional, strategic, infrastructural needs are subscribed to by both parties. Unless the time lag between identifying need, the function of the local authority and the provision of funding, the function of central Government, is reduced, we will continue to experience such bottleneck crises in the economy, of which housing is just one, although the most critical.</P>
      <P>The second item which is in urgent need of amending legislation to the planning Acts is allowing contributions towards the provision of public transport to be levied on large-scale developments. At present and at the behest of Government, all Dublin local authorities are granting planning permission for developments, some of which are on a scale large enough to not only justify the provision of public transport but to manifestly require it. Every day is a lost opportunity because of lack of enabling legislation to facilitate contributions to be made towards the provision of those services. Councils are empowered to seek road contributions but if we move towards higher densities and infill developments, as recommended by Bacon, contributions for new road construction become less relevant and public transport contributions become more essential. If existing residents are to accept higher densities, the very least they will expect and demand is public transport. I ask the Minister to move speedily to bring forward enabling legislation and not to leave it to the review of the larger Planning and Development Act which is not due to be published until mid year, which is too late.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the record level of new housing output in 1998;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the urgent and comprehensive range of measures taken by the Government in the policy document Action on House Prices, following on the Government commissioned report 'An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments';</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" />&ndash;the measures taken to improve access by first-time purchasers to housing through improvements to the shared ownership scheme, reduced stamp duty levels, measures to tackle speculative investment in 'starter' housing and higher housing densities in suitable locations;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the moderation in house price increases in the second half of 1998 resulting from the Government's actions;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the introduction of the Serviced Land Initiative to produce 100,000 additional sites for housing by the end of next year;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups and the increased financial provision for these programmes in 1999;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the increase in the local authority housing programme in 1999 to its highest level in 13 years;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the improved terms of the voluntary housing schemes;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the improved terms and increased resources for disabled persons and essential repair grants;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the highest ever financial provision for the Task Force on Housing Aid for the Elderly;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the substantially increased resources and the expanding range of responses to meet the needs of homeless persons including funding for the first 'Foyer' project in the country;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, progress with its implementation and the continued high level of funding for traveller accommodation;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the introduction of tax incentives for the provision of accommodation for third level students;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the fact that the Irish Home Builders Association has introduced with effect from 1 February, 1999, a code of conduct which addresses the problem of gazumping by house builders;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the provision of funding for the comprehensive regeneration of Ballymun;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the provision of funding for the redevelopment of Dublin Inner City Flat complexes at Lourdes House, Mountainview Court, Sean Treacy House, St. Joseph's Mansions, St. Jude's Gardens, St. Michael's Estate, Poplar Row/Courtney Place, Marmion Court/Queen Street and Bridgefoot Street/Island Street;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the reference of the issues of gazumping and security of tenure in the private <Col N="938" /> rented sector to the Law Reform Commission for examination;</P>
    <P>&ndash;and supports the continued commitment by the Government to expand the supply of housing across all tenures and to improve access by all income groups, particularly first-time purchasers, to suitable and affordable housing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I read with interest and some dismay the list of demands in the motion proposed. Some of these suggestions are sensible and are already being implemented. Some are for the optics, and, while unlikely to achieve much, may not actually be harmful. Some are simply off the rails and demonstrate a serious lack of awareness of what the current housing situation requires by way of Government action.</P>
    <P>It is said that those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them. I wonder how much thought the proponents of this motion have given to the effects of some of their demands, for example, the impact of an increase in the new house grant on house prices, the effect on the housing market of different stamp duty rates for first-time buyers and other purchasers, or how a crash programme of 10,000 local authority housing starts over the next four years could be financed and undertaken without adverse effects on the supply and price of building land, serious capacity constraints on the building industry and further pressure on all house prices. This is quite apart from the danger of returning to the large, soulless peripheral local authority housing estates of the past.</P>
    <P>This Government has a credible and coherent housing strategy&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which is designed to increase housing supply, to improve access to housing for lower income groups and to improve the housing conditions of local authority tenants and other key groups such as the elderly, homeless persons and the disabled.</P>
      <P>Housing is at the top of the Government's priorities. Housing is fundamentally important to individuals, households and the overall economy. There should be no doubt that this Government regards addressing housing needs as an essential element of its overall social policies.</P>
      <P>It would help to put this whole debate into a proper perspective, if I outline briefly where we are coming from and the main strategic features of the Government's approach to housing as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government's policy document Action on House Prices, the 1999 Estimates of expenditure for housing and the 1999 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government set out its key priorities including a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups; refurbishment of existing inadequate housing; <Col N="939" /> improvement and extension of social housing schemes; maximum co-ordination of housing policy and local authorities developing serviced sites to accelerate the supply of new houses to meet rising demands and deflate escalating house prices. In the relatively short time since the Government took office we have achieved remarkable progress in tackling house prices and the social housing measures.</P>
    <P>In recent years, Ireland's economic growth has been little short of phenomenal. GDP grew by an average of 9 per cent per annum since 1993 and an average of 7 per cent per annum since 1990. This strong economic performance is providing real benefits to people. Inflation has averaged 2 per cent per annum in recent years. Most importantly, employment has expanded significantly, by more than a quarter since 1993 and unemployment has fallen from a peak of almost 16 per cent in 1993 to about 7 per cent in 1998. However, this economic growth, coupled with significant sociological and demographic change, has contrived to profoundly increase housing demand.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that house prices are determined by the interaction of supply and demand. The problems we have been experiencing in the housing market in recent years are primarily a result of the imbalance that has developed between supply and demand for housing. This has occurred despite the fact that never in the history of the State have we achieved a better performance in terms of housing output. Housing output reached a new record in 1998 at more than 41,500 units, almost 8,000 up on the level set in 1996. We are building new houses at twice the level of 1993. We are building new houses at a rate of more than 11 per 1,000 population &ndash; a rate which is by far the highest in Europe and more than three times the rate in the United Kingdom. We are building 800 houses per week.</P>
    <P>That house prices have increased steeply despite this remarkable leap forward in housing output is due largely to the fact that demand for housing has escalated at an unprecedented rate. Developments in the housing market have closely mirrored the overall pattern of growth in the economy. Clearly, our tremendous economic performance in recent years has put enormous pressure on infrastructure, including the supply and availability of serviced land. The effects of rapid growth in incomes and employment, significant increase in the number of people in the key household formation age groups, smaller household sizes and very high net immigration, have all impacted hugely on demand for housing.</P>
    <P>This current situation has not happened overnight. As long ago as 1995, house prices were increasing significantly ahead of inflation. The problem of house prices had emerged long before this Government took office. The momentum of house price inflation, driven by an imbalance <Col N="940" /> between supply and demand, was there for all to see.</P>
    <P>The difference between this Government and its predecessor is that we did not stand back with a sense of awe and helplessness. Shortly after coming into office I commissioned a consultancy study on house prices to obtain a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the problem that had been building for a number of years. The Bacon report, published last April, provided a sound basis for policy formulation. The Government responded immediately with a substantial and well balanced package of measures &ndash; Action on House Prices &ndash; implementing virtually all the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>In late 1997 at the same time as we commissioned the Bacon study we launched the Serviced Land Initiative. It was perfectly clear to us &ndash; and should have been to the rainbow coalition &ndash; that immediate action was required to increase the amount of serviced land for housing. House buyers were paying and continue to pay the price for our predecessor's inactivity. There is a long lead time to produce housing. Where this is compounded by serious infrastructural bottlenecks on land supply, the results are obvious.</P>
    <P>The previous Government did nothing to address this fundamental problem. Worse still, it indulged in some very ill-judged tinkering with stamp duty rates, introducing 50 per cent increases in the rate of stamp duty on houses priced from £150,000 upwards. This showed a lamentable lack of understanding of how the housing market is integrated with people moving to different type houses as their needs change. Essentially, the message given to house owners by the previous Government was &ldquo;we will tax you heavily if you move from your existing home.&rdquo;  People tend to act rationally to financial disincentives. Consequently, there was a dearth of middle range houses on the second hand market. By failing to adjust stamp duty rates to take account of house price inflation, first-time buyers of a second hand house had to pay stamp duty at a rate of 6 per cent, which amounted to £5,000 or £6,000 on a house costing between £85,000 and £100,000. For example, as a result of the previous Government's action on stamp duty, if someone wished to move from a house valued at £150,000 to a house valued at £200,000 the transaction costs of the move were more than £20,000 of which stamp duty was £18,000.</P>
    <P>The rainbow coalition must also have been aware that first-time buyers were being increasingly squeezed out of the starter home market by speculators &ndash; as if the problems caused by inadequate supply of new and second hand houses and penal stamp duty rates were not enough. Yet the previous Government was content to allow the activity of speculation in housing to be subsidised by over-generous tax reliefs. Investors are necessary to provide private rented accommodation. However, with low interest rates, the prospect of capital appreciation and Government incentives, housing became a one way bet. One <Col N="941" /> simply could not lose if one had money to speculate. The previous Government should not have allowed such distortion to continue, especially when the main victims were the hard pressed first-time buyers whose tax breaks were far less attractive and valuable than those available to investors.</P>
    <P>This is the sorry scenario we faced on taking office, a nightmare for the house buyer &ndash; particularly the first time buyer &ndash; and a growing threat to the continued success of our economy, with ominous signs of a bubble market developing as tax driven speculation pumped house prices upwards.</P>
    <P>We are still grappling with the effects of the previous Government's failure to take timely action. We have taken decisive action and will continue to push forward with maximum determination. There are welcome signs that we are turning the corner.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced in the Government's Action on House Prices addressed factors that were causing overheating or distortions in the market and were designed to restore a better balance between supply and demand. Measures to assist first-time buyers formed a key element of the package, including removal of fiscal incentives to investors, who had been pricing low income buyers out of the housing market; an increase in the income limits for the local authority shared ownership scheme; significant reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower price levels; and measures to boost housing supply, through the Serviced Land Initiative and increased residential density.</P>
    <P>Reduced interest rates arising from our membership of EMU will also help affordability.</P>
    <P>The full effect of many of the measures taken, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, are only beginning to be seen and will continue to operate into the medium term. Positive effects have already been reported by market sources, including indications of easing in house prices, investors no longer squeezing first-time buyers out of the starter home market, and an increase in the number of secondhand houses coming on the market, as a result of stamp duty reductions.</P>
    <P>The house price figures available for the December quarter of 1998 provide strong evidence of a significant moderation in the rate of house price increase in the second half of 1998, particularly new house prices. This clearly reflects the fact that the measures in the Government's Action on House Prices stopped investors from bidding up prices in the new starter house market where they had been buying up houses virtually in job lots.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of these last quarter trends is that the annual rate of house price increase in Dublin was at a lower level than at any period since the third quarter of 1997. We are now beginning to see the results of the action taken by the Government and the trend of house price stabilisation that is emerging &ndash; for example, <Col N="942" /> second-hand house prices in the Dublin area increased by less than 1 per cent in the December quarter &ndash; will be greatly reinforced in the months and years ahead, particularly as our efforts to ensure continued increase in the supply of housing bear fruit.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised on previous occasions the need to avoid demand-led interventions, such as increased grants or subsidies that could, in the prevailing market conditions, only lead to a resurgence of steep house price escalation. Increased supply of housing is ultimately the only way to meet the increase in the level of demand. I must, therefore, reject the populist demand in the motion for an increase in the first-time buyers grant which could achieve little except to further boost new house prices and pass the benefit on to builders.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy with regard to stamp duty is to reduce its burden throughout the housing market, thereby helping to increase activity and mobility in the market. Focusing stamp duty relief on one sector of the market would simply create further anomalies.</P>
    <P>With increased housing output we are using up zoned and serviced land at a rapid rate. As I have said, our priority is to increase housing supply and two of the key elements of the Government's strategy on housing supply are the serviced land initiative and increased housing density. The serviced land initiative to increase the supply of serviced land for housing, launched prior to the Bacon report, has been twice augmented since and complemented by funding for road access to development land, bringing total Government funding to £44 million. This special Government funding will result in overall investment of over £100 million in land servicing and access, yielding some 100,000 additional sites for housing, the equivalent of an additional &ndash; that phrase must be emphasised &ndash; two and a half years housing output. Local authorities have been asked to expedite delivery of schemes under the initiative.</P>
    <P>The initiative is, of course, additional to the main water and sewerage investment programme. The recently launched 1999 programme is once again at a record level. Over £275 million will be spent on water and sewerage infrastructural development this year and the potential for this investment to bring more residential land into service will be maximised.</P>
    <P>The proposal for increased residential density is one demand in the motion which I support unequivocally. Housing densities in Ireland are low by international standards and this is one of the supply constraints contributing to house price increases, particularly in Dublin. Increased density in cities and on high quality public transport links is desirable on grounds of sustainability and can also help to counteract problems of commuter traffic and promote the provision of more efficient public transport. Planning authorities have already been advised to promote higher densities at appropriate locations. Consultants are currently finalising draft planning guidelines <Col N="943" /> on residential density and these will be available for public consultation by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>I see increased residential density as being vital to the Government's strategy in relation to housing supply, stabilisation of house prices and sustainable development. While, as I have already said, measures to increase housing supply generally take time to have effect, the benefits of increased density can, in many cases, be felt more quickly than other supply measures. The effects can be maximised by concentrating particularly on locations, such as inner city areas or close to public transport, where high density levels are most achievable.</P>
    <P>The release of land already in public ownership for housing would contribute towards improving housing supply. At present, the Department of Finance is actively seeking to ascertain the amount of State-owned lands which might be suitable for this purpose and I expect the results of this study to be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The motion also called for the introduction of legislation to ring-fence development levies for use on community projects. The concept of ring-fencing is, of course, already very much part of the levying of development contributions because funding received must be spent on the infrastructure for which the development contribution was required. Development levies already make a valuable contribution towards the cost of necessary infrastructure, including water services and roads, and the issue of levies for community infrastructure is being examined in the review of the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>As a means of further increasing supply, I have asked local authority managers to explore fully the scope for using temporary treatment facilities to allow housing development to proceed where major infrastructural works are planned but will take some time to complete. This can, in certain circumstances, be a valuable means of bringing additional land for residential development into service much earlier than would otherwise be the case. With modern technology and the application of appropriate standards and safeguards, this can be a very acceptable and cost effective approach.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the importance of the private rented sector and the need to maximise its potential in meeting our housing objectives, particularly in the context of changes in Irish social patterns which are influencing the nature of housing demand such as: a reduction in average household size; a greater tendency for young single people to live outside the family home, increasingly in rented accommodation; and an increasing tendency towards contract working.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally a high rate of owner occupancy compared with other countries. Government policy will continue to facilitate this goal as the preferred option of the majority of households. However, after many years of decline, there has, in recent years, been renewed expansion and diversification in the rented sector <Col N="944" /> with significant growth in demand for, and supply of, good quality apartments. The improvements which have been achieved in private rented accommodation reflect particularly the success of the urban renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be announcing the introduction of the residential elements of the new urban renewal schemes in advance of the resolution of the issues which are currently under discussion with the EU Commission on the commercial and other elements of the package.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion calls on the Government to review the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, so as to increase the rights of tenants and to provide incentives for the private rented sector to develop longer-term leases. The rights of tenants in private rented accommodation are, in the first instance, governed by the terms of the lease or other tenancy arrangement under which the tenancy is held. These are subject to the provisions of the landlord and tenant code which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The consideration of what action may be warranted and possible in relation to the rights of tenants must be considered in consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and would be more relevant to the general landlord and tenant legislative code than to the Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>Consideration of the issue of greater security of tenure has to take account of both the complex nature of the landlord and tenant code and constitutional issues. The fair and equitable balance of rights between both parties is not easily achieved. Over-regulation could have a damaging impact on the supply of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>A poorly thought-out legislative intervention in this area has the capacity to do more harm than good, a message clearly brought out in a recent Threshold conference on the private rented sector. My Department is currently examining possible approaches by which necessary and appropriate amendments to landlord and tenant law in the area of residential accommodation might be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The key to achieving stability in the private rented sector is, in the final analysis, the same as in the housing market as a whole &ndash; increased supply of housing. All the sectors in the housing market are inter-related &ndash; a problem in one area will ultimately impinge on another. The fundamental supply-demand imbalance has also impinged on the private rented sector. We must, therefore, continue to increase the total supply of housing. None of the measures referred to in the motion, irrespective of how attractive some of these may be, especially for a party in Opposition, can substitute for this essential requirement.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee comprising officials of the relevant Departments is examining the issues which arise in relation to the transfer of the administration of SWA housing supplementation from the health boards to local auth<Col N="945" /> orities. Transfer of this to local authorities gives rise to a number of important issues with wide-ranging implications for recipients under the scheme, local authorities and other agencies concerned. It is hoped to finalise the work of the interdepartmental committee shortly.</P>
    <P>Our priority must be to promote long-term commitment to the sector on a basis that will work to the benefit of both the providers and tenants of private rented accommodation. Incentives for the provision of private rented accommodation are appropriate where they are well targeted and result in an increase in housing supply. The announcement in the budget of the extension of section 23 type incentives to purpose-built student accommodation provides a good example of a well targeted initiative in his area. This will contribute to the provision of private rented accommodation for third level students and should ease pressures in the general rental market in the medium-term.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for legislation to ban the practice of gazumping. Many complex legal issues would be involved in drafting any such legislation in order to ensure, for example, that house purchasers are not locked into a contract before they have either arranged their finances or have finally decided they wish to buy the house. Following an approach by me in this regard, the Attorney General has requested the Law Reform Commission to review the payment of booking deposits and the associated practice of gazumping and to submit to the Attorney General proposals for reform in respect of those matters that the commission considers appropriate. I understand that the commission has already commenced this review. I am grateful that it has taken up this matter quickly.</P>
    <P>The Irish Home Builders Association has recently launched a voluntary code of conduct which I understand will be mandatory for all members of the association. The introduction by the industry of such a voluntary code of practice was, of course, one of the recommendations of the Bacon report which the Government was anxious to see implemented quickly. The code sets out to deal with three issues, gazumping, phased release of developments and interim payments. It is my understanding that the three elements of the code are separate, stand-alone measures. On that basis, I regard the code as an improvement on the current situation in so far as it relates to gazumping. It sets out that the builder must provide the contract to the purchaser within four weeks or other agreed period of receipt of a booking deposit. The purchaser will then have three weeks to return the contract. During this period the builder is precluded from increasing the price or accepting an offer from another party. The protection afforded to the new house purchaser by the prevention of an increase in price and prohibition on acceptance of an offer from another party for a seven week period following payment of a booking deposit represents an improvement on the current position. The <Col N="946" /> introduction of legislation in this area will depend on the effectiveness of the voluntary code and on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission regarding the desirability and feasibility of a legislative approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>I note the code's attempts to improve transparency in relation to the phased release of developments, although the wording is somewhat vague in this regard. I will be seeking further clarification from the Irish Home Builders Association as to the precise obligations on developers in terms of the advertising of different phases of housing developments. I will also be seeking further information from the association regarding the nature of sanctions to be applied to builders who do not comply with the code and the mechanisms and length of time involved in dealing with complaints.</P>
    <P>I have serious concerns about the interim payments element of the code. I would not wish to see the extension of the practice of builders seeking stage payments to areas where it has not been normal practice to date. I also regard the level of the interim payments, as set out in the code, as not being in the interest of the house purchaser. The schedule of interim payments where title to the site is transferred before completion of the transaction, as set out in the code, provides that the purchaser would have 90 per cent of the agreed purchase price paid at internal plastering stage. A significant amount of work inside the house and in terms of estate development remains to be completed at that point and it is likely that a considerable amount of time may elapse before the purchaser could take possession.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that house purchasers should not be asked to make interim payments which exceed the amounts guaranteed under the HomeBond warranty scheme. Interim payments which are not covered by the warranty expose the house purchaser to an unacceptable degree of risk. I have written to the association asking it to ensure members neither seek interim payments in excess of the Home Bond warranty nor seek to extend the practice of stage payments to areas where they did not previously operate and to furnish assurances to me in these respects. If these assurances are not forthcoming, I will take any appropriate action open to me.</P>
    <P>Meeting the needs of persons who cannot afford to provide adequate housing from their own resources is a key element of the Government's housing policy. Through a combination of factors, including high housing costs, cutbacks in public expenditure which curtailed social housing investment in the 1980s and early 1990s, the age profile of the population and changes in the structures of household composition and size, social housing needs have increased in recent years. Considerable priority has been afforded, therefore, to tackling increased social housing needs. Our approach is two pronged &ndash; to increase the traditional local authority house building pro<Col N="947" /> gramme and to expand voluntary housing activity and output under other complementary schemes such as shared ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to be taken that we are awaiting the results of the assessment before we act. The Department is well aware of the housing situation on the ground. The Government's expansion of the local authority programme to its highest level for many years is an immediate response to increasing needs in advance of the assessment.</P>
      <P>We have indications from our ongoing contacts with local authorities of increases in the numbers applying for local authority housing. A figure of more than 40,000 households seeking housing has been widely mentioned and is likely to be a reasonable reflection of the overall number of applications before the individual applications are assessed by the local authority. The assessment of need will provide accurate data on the extent and nature of the housing needs in each of the 90 housing authority areas.</P>
      <P>The commitment of the Government to the provision of social housing is reflected in the significantly increased funding for social housing since the Government took office. Investment in the local authority housing programme for 1999, at almost £230 million, is four times greater than for 1993. I have secured increases of 18 per cent for the programme in each of the last two years. The 1999 capital provision will allow 4,500 starts, the highest number in 13 years. While the local authority programme has been accelerated we are conscious of the fact that largescale local authority house building in the 1970s and early 1980s had unfortunate side effects. In expanding the programme, we are trying to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. The traditional approach of building on a 100 acre greenfield site may provide houses but at great cost to the community in the long-term. This is not the type of peripheral local authority housing estates that we would wish to return to but would be inescapable with a 40,000 units four year crash programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Nowhere in the motion is there mention of the cost of this programme or how it might be met. Taking a modest cost of around £75,000 per unit the total cost of 40,000 starts over the next four years would be £3 billion. If the Opposition was serious about its proposals it might have set out how the funding would be provided &ndash; by how much it would increase taxes or, alternatively, which services it would curtail to meet these costs.</P>

      <P>The Government has made significant resources available to local authorities for redevelopment and refurbishment of their housing stock. There are widely acknowledged problems in many of Dublin's older flat complexes. My Department recently approved Dublin Corporation's proposals for the comprehensive redevelopment of nine run-down flat complexes throughout the city and will contribute funds for the initiative beginning with a provision of £6.5 million this year. The redevelopment proposals consist of a mix of some new build, refurbishment of some flats, where this is considered feasible, and the demolition of other flats and their replacement with low rise housing at a total cost of £87.8 million spread over five years. The proposals are designed to tackle the serious problems of multiple deprivation associated with corporation flats in the city, including the serious drugs problem. The flat complexes in question are Lourdes House, Mountainview Court, Sean Treacy House, St. Jude's Gardens, St. Michael's Estate, Poplar Row-Courtney Place, Marmion Court-Queen Street, Bridgefoot Street-Island Street. I am pleased that one of the complexes will be redeveloped by the St. Pancras Housing Association.</P>

      <P>Recently I reminded local authorities to renew their efforts to respond to housing needs in their areas by developing to the full the potential of the range of social and voluntary housing measures available to them to supplement their housing programmes. The numbers of houses built under the social housing scheme are disappointing. I appeal to councillors to avail of the funding in the Department under the social and voluntary housing schemes to provide urgently needed housing. Taken together with the range of social housing options whose terms and conditions have now been improved, the local authority housing programme is well placed to continue to meet people's needs for housing, for good living conditions and to contribute to the improvement of the physical environment of urban and rural areas. I expect that in 1999 total output of social housing and casual vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock will cater for the needs of some 10,250 households. That estimate is based on the same method of assessment that has been used in recent years by previous Governments.</P>
      <P>We included a number of important measures in the 1999 budget. The task force on special housing aid for the elderly is specifically designed to help elderly people living on their own. In the budget we provided an extra £1.7 million for the task force.</P>
      <P>The disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes have both been increased. The maximum disabled person's grant has gone from £8,000 to £12,000. The effective essential repairs grant has gone from £1,800 under the Government of Deputy Dukes's party to £4,500 and it will now be available in urban areas.</P>

      <Col N="950" /> The level of homelessness has increased in recent times. The actual situation will be known when the assessment of homelessness is carried out by local authorities in March as part of the housing needs assessment.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the wide range of measures which have been taken by the Government which is serious about taking action to ensure that we increase the output of housing to meet the housing needs of our people.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> I welcome the motion proposed by Deputy Dukes.  I have tabled our amendment to deepen and strengthen some of the remedial measures proposed to deal with the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to the motion is pathetic. He asserts that the level of activity on housing is adequate, he recites an inaccurate list of the perceived shortcomings of his predecessors despite the fact that he is now almost two years in office and it is time to take responsibility for his own record in Government and he rebuts every single proposal put forward in the motion and every idea put forward by people outside this House to deal with the housing crisis. He does not announce a single new policy proposal or initiative despite the fact that he has had half an hour to do so.</P>
    <P>This Minister of State with responsibility for housing says there is no housing crisis. He and his Government are responsible for the most inactive record on housing of any Government in living memory. Never before has every aspect of housing from house purchase to homelessness been in such crisis. Yet this Minister and this Government, blessed with more resources than any of their predecessors are not only failing to act but refusing even to acknowledge the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever in this State, a young working couple in professional occupations cannot afford to buy a home of their own, council housing lists are the longest they have ever been, rents in the private sector are unaffordable and we have record levels of homelessness. The Minister and the Government seem to be having difficulty coming to terms with the fact that they are almost two years in office. It is no longer an acceptable substitute for policy inaction to make inaccurate statements about the record of their predecessors because since the Government took office house prices have increased by more than 60 per cent, 20,000 additional applicants have gone on housing waiting lists, private sector rents have risen by 50 per cent, the rate of evictions from private flats has quadrupled and more families are losing their homes through eviction in 1999 than 120 years ago when Michael Davitt formed the Land League to campaign for fair rents and fixity of tenure. Homelessness is so out of control that none of the statutory or voluntary agencies can now even put a figure on the number without homes. The numbers sleeping rough in Dublin has increased by 37 per cent. That is the record of this Government. Yet the Minister insists there is no crisis and that he is on top of the problem. How much worse do things have to get before the Government takes the problem seriously and gives it the priority it deserves?</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government does not even acknowledge that there is a housing crisis and its inaction is incredible. Despite every serious commentator having pointed to the need to reform our planning laws to increase housing supply, legislation has not yet <Col N="952" /> been published in this area. Of the 101 Bills promised by the Government and contained in the Government's legislative list, not a single Bill is included to deal with any aspect of the housing crisis, from price gazumping to the protection of tenants' rights. The Minister has promised an additional 600 local authority housing starts for this year which is miniscule considering that an additional 10,000 applicants have gone on to waiting lists in the past year alone. Nothing has been done, or is even promised, to tackle profiteering in the housing market. According to his own Department's housing statistics bulletin, the house price index at the end of the third quarter of last year stood at 185 or 60 points ahead of the house building cost index and almost 70 points ahead of both the consumer price index and the average earnings index for adult workers. First Active, in its recent survey, showed that in the past year house prices rose by 44 per cent or 20 times the rate of inflation and 20 times the rate of increase in the cost of building a house.</P>
    <P>The most depressing aspect of the present shortage is the Government's failure to admit it, to do something about it or even to plan for some longer term solution. Housing has now long replaced unemployment as this country's biggest social problem. Unless it is given the same priority as job creation and all of the social partners and relevant Government Departments and agencies are mobilised and focused on its solution it will destroy the economic success in which we all now take pride.</P>
    <P>Shelter is a basic human need. If those who are at work can no longer provide a home for themselves and their families, they will inevitably either question the value of working in the first place or seek greater reward. House price inflation and housing shortages will inevitably work its way into the general economy and the individual personal hardship now being experienced by those who cannot provide or obtain their own homes will lead to a much more serious problem for all.</P>
    <P>This country has prided itself on being a home-owning democracy. Our unwritten, unspoken social charter holds that if you work, the reward will enable you to provide for yourself and your family. That understanding meant a person could provide his own home. That social contract on which relative social stability has been built and maintained has now been seriously undermined. A young couple today, setting out to buy their first home are faced with house prices for a standard three bedroom semi of between £110,000 and £120,000 in the greater Dublin area. To buy the cheapest new house in Dublin at around £110,000 the couple will need savings of around £20,000 to cover the shortfall between mortgage and price and to provide for legal fees, furnishings etc. They will, in addition, need a mortgage of about £100,000.</P>
    <P>To get a mortgage of £100,000 under the traditional formula used by most lending agencies &ndash; 2.5 times the income of the higher earner plus the <Col N="953" /> income of the lower earner &ndash; they will need to have a combined income of somewhere between £45,000 and £50,000 to qualify for a loan. This means that two teachers, two nurses, two gardaí or two executive officers or higher executive officers in the Civil Service will not qualify for a loan and unless they have some private income, or parents who commit their retirement lump sum as very often happens, they will not be able to buy a home of their own. Given the low interest rates, some lending agencies may be willing to stretch the lending criteria.</P>
    <P>Two teachers, for example, on the sixth or seventh point of their scale will have a combined income of about £35,000. For them, if they get a loan, repayments on a £100,000 loan will be close to £700 per month. Taken together with transport costs, child care costs and other costs associated with working, the real disposable income of such a family is bordering on material poverty in order to pay a mortgage. Inevitably, the marginal benefit of work for one of the partners comes seriously into question. A couple who manage to buy a house, even with the burden of a large loan, at least have a secure roof over their heads, but a couple whose earnings are £5,000 to £10,000 lower are caught in a housing poverty trap. Their income is too low for them to get a loan and too high for them to go on the council housing list. They end up renting in the private sector and face monthly rental payments of £600 to £700 for a family size dwelling with no security of tenure. Inevitably, the high price of houses, the high rents and shortage of private rented accommodation have driven increased numbers on to the housing waiting list, which has grown at an alarming rate and public housing provision is falling way behind.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the 600 extra housing starts for 1999. That is grossly inadequate when one considers an extra 10,000 applicants are coming on to the housing list every year. To disguise how inadequate it is, the Minister of State shifts the count and says he will provide for 10,215 new lettings in 1999. That is old style Fianna Fáil double counting. If a tenant is transferred from a three bedroomed flat to a newly built council house, that is one letting; if another tenant is transferred from a two bedroomed flat to the vacant three bedroomed flat, that is a second letting; and if a housing applicant is allocated the two bedroomed flat, that is a third letting. In this case, there is only one additional new dwelling and only one applicant will be taken off the housing list. That is mainly how the Minister gets 10,000 lettings from 4,500 new starts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the present position. When we were in office 20,000 fewer people were on the housing waiting list. I am not satisfied with the current lettings bamboozlement. The Minister of State also spoke of the additional money he will provide. Additional money percentages, impressive though they sound, do not necessarily take more people off the housing list, especially when house prices are high and the performance of some housing authorities is less than impressive. The extra money the Minister of State quoted does not take account of the fact that more money is available in the first instance. When we examine his money performance more closely, we find local authority housing capital expenditure as a percentage of total capital expenditure has fallen. In 1999 housing will account for 7 per cent of total capital expenditure, the lowest it has been for six years and a far cry from 9.3 per cent of total capital expenditure in 1995. That is impossible to justify given the size of the housing problem and the healthy state of the country's finances. It is difficult to understand how the Minister of State can say housing is at the top of the Government's list of priorities when the proportion of public expenditure the Government is committing to it is less this year than it has been for six years.</P>
      <P>It all comes down to a long frustrating wait for housing applicants. There are young couples whose children are stuck in the boxroom of an in-laws' overcrowded house with family and inter-personal tension mounting by the day. Housing applicants are living in substandard and over-priced private flats, while their bad landlords are effectively subsidised by the taxpayer through the rent allowance scheme. Single elderly people trying to maintain some standards in their lives are living in fear of their landlords' knocking on their door, the expected notice to quit, their unprecedented and unfamiliar appearance in court, the humiliation of eviction and homelessness and the shame of becoming a reluctant dependant on State housing after working all their lives for personal independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member of this House and every member of a local authority who is in touch with his or her constituents knows all of the personal hardships that go to make up the number on the housing list. The Minister of State must know this from his considerable constituency experience. Why is he and the Government doing so little about it? Why is housing so far down the Government's list of real priorities? Is the Progressive Democrats blind faith in the self-regulating market preventing the Government from intervening <Col N="955" /> or is Fianna Fáil's legendary liaison with the construction industry making it so reluctant to act on the side of the home buyer, the tenant or the housing applicant? </P>
    <P>The Government is almost two years in office, but it has no housing policy, unless one can describe a continuation of its current inactivity a policy. Every time it is asked about it, it points to the Bacon report. Peter Bacon and his associates were asked to examine particular aspects and distortions in the housing market and they did so professionally. However, their recommendations were not fully implemented by the Government and, even if they had been, they would not have been sufficient to deal with a problem that is wider than the remit given to Mr. Bacon in the first instance. It is unfair to Mr. Bacon and his associates for the Government to continue to link his name so often with their failure of policy. Mr. Bacon is not the Minister with responsibility for housing and it was not his responsibility to provide a surrogate housing policy for this hopeless Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have not been short of advice and suggestions as to what needs to be done to tackle the housing crisis. Voluntary bodies, trade unions, professional organisations, lending agencies and reputable economists and planners have all put forward proposals. I am mindful of bodies such as Threshold, the homeless initiative, Simon, Dublin Corporation, SIPTU, the CPSU, auctioneers and valuers, building societies, Colm McCarthy of DKM, Peter Bacon and many more who, over the past year and a half, identified the problems and suggested a way forward. What has the Minister of State done to assess and draw from this wealth of information and advice on national housing policy? Nothing. Has he established a housing policy unit in his Department? No. Has the Government established a housing committee? No. Will the Minister of State set up a housing commission? No. Does he have answers to address this problem? Most certainly he does not.</P>
    <P>What needs to be done? Immediate action needs to be taken to tackle the housing waiting list. We require a major increase in the resources allocated to public and social housing. It is necessary to do this now because of the long lead in time between the allocation of resources and the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>Action needs to be taken to tackle profiteering in new house building. There is a problem in relation to land prices. We have come a long way from the recommendation of the Kenny report, but the Government's decision to reduce capital gains tax was bad and is contributing to this problem. There is a need to control land prices. The average price for a new house in Dublin is £120,000, but the cost of building such a house is only £60,000 and the remainder of the cost of the house covers the price of the land.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tackle problems in the private rented sector. A new deal is required in the private rented sector, one which would pro<Col N="956" /> vide protection for tenants, security of tenure, a fair rents regime and enforcement of regulations. At present, only 13,000 of the rented housing units are registered, even though we know there are approximately 80,000 private rented units throughout the country. There is a new deal needed to encourage long-term rather than speculative investment in the private rented sector to encourage institutional investment such as building societies' investment and pension funds.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tackle homelessness immediately. As Deputy Coveney said, it is unacceptable that people are sleeping rough in the doorways in this prosperous city. This is not a short-term problem. There is a need for a long-term strategy, which we are not getting from the Government, which pulls together housing policy, transport and planning. There is a need for radical changes in the way we plan and use our space, and that needs to be integrated. We do not need to repeat the mistakes of the past where housing was regarded as simply providing houses without any regard to the social and community infrastructure that was needed.</P>
    <P>There is a need to increase supply, but supply needs to be increased to meet need, not just economic demand. Somebody with spare cash can add to the demand, but he or she may not be in need of housing. Government policy to date has focused on supply to meet economic demand rather than supply to meet the needs of people who are in need of homes. I heard nothing, for example, from the Minister about the suggestion that 20 per cent of new projects and developments should contain a social housing provision and the need to give that legislative back-up. For example, if there are to be increased densities, there is a need to enshrine that in good design and the provision of community facilities. There is also a need to plan land use on a rational basis, rather than on a developer driven basis, which is the practice we have seen so far.</P>
    <P>We must look at the housing problem in the context of the construction industry as a whole. One of the problems in the construction industry which has contributed to the housing crisis, is its cyclical nature. We need a stable construction industry which is there for the long haul, not based on speculative development, but providing houses to meet the needs of our people and secure employment for its employees. The Government needs to intervene to ensure that we have a construction industry which is sustainable, not one which is there to make a quick buck when times are good and then disappear when times are bad.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The closure of All-Fresh Limited. in Charlestown, County Mayo, is not <Col N="957" /> only a body blow to Charlestown, it is a body blow to the already weak employment and industrial base in County Mayo. The emphasis may be on Cork and the 450 jobs lost in Apple; however, to a jobs devastated county such as Mayo and a jobs starved town such as Charlestown, the closure of All-Fresh is a catastrophe.</P>
      <P>It comes in the wake of the loss of 270 jobs in Asahi in Killala last year; the closure of the Claremorris Baking Company, with a loss of 200 jobs, which have not been replaced; the loss of 80 jobs at the Peter Storm rainwear company in Claremorris, which were not replaced; the loss of 150 jobs at Farah Ltd. in Ballyhaunis, which were not replaced; and the 30 jobs lost recently at in Betatherm in Ballinrobe, which have not been replaced.</P>
      <P>Charlestown has never got its fair share &ndash; or, indeed, any share &ndash; of Government created jobs. Any jobs created in Charlestown were hewn from local enterprise. Charlestown finds itself on the edge of the black triangle, an area starved of jobs for years, dependent on a vulnerable small farming structure and which, year in year out, saw its life blood drained away, bled white by emigration. The plight of Charlestown was well encapsulated in Charlestown-born John Healy's book, <i>And Nobody Shouted Stop</i>.</P>
      <P>To Charlestown, an enterprise such as All-Fresh is of huge economic importance. It gives real employment. It puts approximately £1 million into the local economy each year. Much of the employment is off-farm &ndash; people combining a job with the maintenance of a small family farm.</P>
      <P>I feel very sorry for the 450 workers in Cork who have lost their jobs. Their loss is very real, very individual and very personal. However, the devastation to an area such as Charlestown of the loss of 100 jobs is many times more catastrophic. There is no replacement in sight.</P>
      <P>The Charlestown jobs dilemma needs to be tackled on two fronts. First, every effort must be made to salvage the jobs in All-Fresh. I appreciate that a receiver is in place. I also understand that a consortium of workers at the plant may be in a position to make a bid to keep it operating as a going concern. I urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State to encourage, support and do everything possible to ensure this initiative is successful. There are plenty of precedents for it. If this proposition is not successful, the possibility of it being bought by an outside enterprise as a going concern should be encouraged. It should be taken over with the maximum number of jobs retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, Charlestown also needs to get the focus and attention it has not received up to now. It has not been sold or considered by the IDA for its attractiveness, presentation or location. It is on the border of Mayo and Sligo and the intersection of two national primary roads, the N5 and the N17. It is a stone's throw from Knock Airport. It has an excellent primary and post-primary school <Col N="958" /> and superb community sports halls. It has assets and advantages which have not been marketed.</P>
    <P>I am asking for special emphasis and focus to be given to this area. A special enterprise unit should be set up, consisting of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the county enterprise board and local interests, to sell Charlestown as the attractive base that it is. The people of Charlestown are rightfully envious when they hear of high profile announcements for here, there and everywhere, yet there is nothing for Charlestown. The rot, drain and devastation must stop &ndash; as John Healy said, it has to stop now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter. The possible loss of 100 jobs is a serious setback for Charlestown and for the surrounding region of north Mayo. I sympathise with the employees who are facing the strong possibility of being made redundant.</P>
      <P>I understand that a receiver has been appointed to the All-Fresh Bakery and is having ongoing discussions with a number of parties for its sale as a going concern. It is particularly sad that such a state of affairs has been reached in a well established company which has a long association with County Mayo. The company has been based in Charlestown since the late 1870s and has been one of the principal employers in the area since then.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is providing advice to those interested in trying to get the plant back into operation as a going concern. The agency will continue to provide as much help as possible, and I sincerely hope it will be possible to overcome the present difficult situation by building on the skills and the market base in the area. I have asked the development agencies to work closely with the local community development bodies in Charlestown, which have already responded to the threatened job losses.</P>
      <P>It was in recognition of the special needs of this region that the Tánaiste established the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative in June 1997, in the wake of the closure of the Asahi plant in Ballina. That initiative continues to have a significant beneficial influence on employment prospects in the region and the progress it has already made demonstrates the community resources that can be mobilised in response to job losses.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is heavily involved with the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative. Together with the Mayo county enterprise board, it is represented on the indigenous subcommittee of the initiative, which has a particular focus on identifying and developing enterprise centre space, working with potential start ups and companies at an early stage of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress made on the job front in the area, since the Tánaiste established the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative on 10 July 1997, has included both business expansions in the indigenous sector and new inward investment. In the course of <Col N="959" /> 1998, Enterprise Ireland/Forbairt approved approximately £1.8 million to companies in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Many new jobs have been announced for the region, including the following: Carrokeel Seafoods, Killala, 85 jobs; Lionbridge Technologies, Ballina, 100 jobs; Coca Cola, Ballina, 150 jobs; and Volex, Castlebar, 200 jobs; Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Westport, 170 jobs. The Coca Cola project alone is a major operation which will create about 650 jobs during its construction phase. The new concentrate plant, costing £160 million, is being built on a 100 acre site off the Killala road in Ballina. The plant is scheduled for completion in July 1999 and recruitment of key staff is expected to begin shortly.</P>
    <P>Together, these new projects will make a significant direct contribution to the region's economy as well as creating additional spin-off employment arising from sub-supply opportunities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and I assure him his suggestions and his contribution tonight will be brought forward by me to the relevant agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to say that this industrial action need not have taken place if warnings and indications had been taken on board when Enterprise Ireland was being set up. I know that discussions were ongoing in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment long before Enterprise Ireland was established by legislation in this House. It is a great pity that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, did not heed the warnings when she rushed helter skelter to set up Enterprise Ireland. She appointed a chairman of a committee, Mr. Molloy, and followed that up almost instantly by appointing a chief executive. Within less than three months she rushed the legislation through the House in June and July 1998 in order to allow the new chief executive to take up duty.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on setting up Enterprise Ireland the Minister informed us there had been extensive consultations between her Department and the staff of the agencies and their trade union representatives. She said meetings were taking place on average every three weeks. She said there had been a full sharing of information and experience between all those involved in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the talks were so positive and everything was going as the Minister expected, why is it that now, eight or nine months later, SIPTU and 750 staff have been obliged to take action. In a statement SIPTU said the persistent refusal to deal with pay differences of up to 40 per cent between staff doing the same work following the amalgamation of two former State agencies, Eolas and the IDA, and the subsequent creation of new bodies For<Col N="960" /> fás, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, triggered a ballot which has now resulted in a decision to take industrial action.</P>
    <P>If this matter had been handled carefully and given time by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her staff, we would not now have 750 staff not answering their telephones. By Friday there will be an escalation and e-mail and computers will not be used either. We are talking about agencies that are responsible for inward and outward investment and assistance to client companies. Before all the agencies were amalgamated, even if there was industrial action in one agency, we might have had the advantage of one of the other stand alone agencies being able to do some of the necessary work.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by this industrial action and the fact that the Department has failed to tackle the issues that were outstanding when the legislation was going through the Dáil. We will not see the result of this action for some time to come. How do we know whether staff involved in this industrial action, but working abroad on behalf of Ireland Incorporated, will lose the opportunity to have an important meeting with somebody who is interested in investing in Ireland? If that meeting is not held the investment will not have a chance of coming to Ireland with a subsequent loss of jobs and economic progress in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may say that this action is having no immediate effect, but he cannot say that with any certainty concerning the future. I am angry that the warnings that I and others gave in the Dáil at the time the legislation to establish Enterprise Ireland was going through have now come to pass because of a lack of effort by the Department to deal with staff issues.</P>
    <P>We have a ludicrous situation where three people can work side by side with as much as a 40 per cent difference in their salaries. An IDA staff person at HEO level can earn a maximum of £28,000; the next area of promotion is to APO with a maximum of £39,000. On the scientific side of this new agency the maximum salary is £42,000. People earning different salaries can be working side by side doing the same work for their clients, with a different orientation.</P>
    <P>We warned that this would happen. I said at the time that I was concerned that in the first six months or even one year the main emphasis will be on sorting out staff positions, new names and grading. I also said that in six months' time Opposition spokespersons will probably inquire into what is happening in Enterprise Ireland because the trade unions and staff associations will have come to a standstill in their discussions with the Department.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to involve the Labour Court in this dispute and to ensure that the concerns of the Exporters' Association are put to rest and that work will continue. The Department should take full responsibility for having led staff into a situation where they have had to take industrial action.</P>
    <Col N="961" />
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute arises from some grading anomalies, as the Deputy pointed out, which have their origins in the establishment of Forbairt in 1994 when former Eolas staff were merged with the indigenous industry directorate of the former IDA. The issue was further complicated by the establishment in July 1998 of Enterprise Ireland, following enactment by the Oireachtas of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>The new agency structure, which included the merger of Forbairt and An Bord Trachtála, brought together three different grading structures which now sit side by side in Forfás, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. SIPTU is seeking upward harmonisation of pay levels for its members.</P>
      <P>These issues were addressed in the first half of last year in the context of the proposed establishment of Enterprise Ireland. Following discussions between SIPTU and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment the matter was referred for direct consideration between Enterprise Ireland management and SIPTU in July 1998. The Labour Relations Commission facilitated discussions between the parties in the period September to December 1998.</P>
      <P>A framework for a proposal was outlined by management to the union on 12 December. On 14 December a general meeting of SIPTU members considered the framework and the outcome was to initiate a ballot for industrial action up to and including strike action. A formal proposal was subsequently sent to the union and rejected.</P>
      <P>On 18 January 1999 SIPTU advised that industrial action would commence with effect from 1 February 1999. Management has been unequivocal in its stated position that discussions should continue utilising the services of the industrial relations agencies before any form of industrial action was taken. In my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I urge both parties to comply with the normal industrial relations procedures, including direct discussions and recourse to the LRC or the Labour Court as appropriate. This is in line with the approach required under the industrial relations procedures of the agencies under the terms of Partnership 2000 and under good industrial relations procedures generally. It is understood that the Labour Court indicated that an early hearing of the case could be arranged.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the potential impact which this action may have on our efforts to develop enterprise, including the attraction of foreign investment. However, the enterprise development agencies have traditionally been characterised by professional staff who consistently show a deep commitment to their clients' interests. I would hope that the staff of the agencies will continue to ensure that the interests of their clients are protected and that the impact on them would be minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been reports in today's media of <Col N="962" /> allegations that this problem is a result of the Tánaiste's approach to complex industrial relations issues. Indeed, this point has been repeated here by Deputy Owen. In the absence of the Tánaiste, I wish to absolutely refute such allegations. In considering the establishment of Enterprise Ireland full account was taken of industrial relations and staffing issues. As I have outlined already, these matters were discussed early last year between the Department and SIPTU, following which they were properly referred for direct consideration between management and the union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this urgent and serious matter. As the Minister is undoubtedly aware, there is a serious crisis in the pig industry. This is more profound in the constituency I represent, Cavan-Monaghan, because of a serious fire at the Lovell and Christmas plant in Northern Ireland and the fact that McCarren's bacon factory in Cavan was closed at the same time. Thankfully, McCarren's has since reopened, but it will take some time before it reaches maximum output.</P>
      <P>The fire in Northern Ireland, the closure of McCarren's and a downturn in the market means the pig industry has totally collapsed and small to medium size pig units are facing bankruptcy. It is vital that the Government immediately comes to the aid of these family units. Debts of over £300,000 to banks and millers are not uncommon. Unless the Government acts, the end result will be that these people will lose their farms. Through no fault of their own, these debts have mounted over the last six months, but further credit facilities from banks and millers are at an end.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a number of units which were unable to procure feed for their pigs last weekend. It is expected that an upturn in the market will come about by mid-summer. Therefore, the Government should act and give financial assistance to units of up to 400 sows in size to help keep them in business until this upturn takes place. I suggest that £200 per sow for the first 100 sows, £100 per sow for the next 200 sows and £50 per sow for the remaining 100 sows should be provided, giving a fund of £45,000. This would help to stave off financial ruin for many of these family size units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister signals the <Col N="963" /> Government's intention to immediately ward off the banks and the millers which are seeking to recover their debts, causing further misery to hard working, decent people who were working to an agenda set for them by Teagasc and Bord Bia. They told them it was necessary to increase production from three million pigs per annum to at least six million. Following those guidelines, during the good years family size units have increased from the usual 100 to 150 sow unit to approximately 300 to 400 sow units. They were becoming more economical and doing a good job. The constituency I represent, Cavan-Monaghan, has some of the best pig husbandry people in the country but they are now facing financial ruin.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, is not present because he would have a full understanding of the terrible problems besetting the industry. However, I am sure he had an input to the Minister of State's reply and I look forward to a positive response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of my colleague and I will try to deal with the issues raised by the Deputy. I am glad to respond on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in the pig sector are not alone being experienced in Ireland but are affecting the entire EU market. A number of reasons brought about these difficulties, the main one being, as the Deputy is aware, over-production in the Community as a whole. This over-production came about as a result of an outbreak of classic swine fever in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and, to a lesser extent, Belgium. A slaughter policy was introduced to halt the spread of the disease. Over ten million pigs were slaughtered which created a shortage of raw materials in the industry and pushed up market prices to record levels.</P>
      <P>This in turn encouraged increased production, eventually leading to an over-supply on the market which has led to the current low prices being experienced. At present the EU market is about 108 per cent self-sufficient. Other factors contributing to the difficulties include the Japanese market which was sluggish in 1998 and did not take as much pigmeat imports as usual. Russia, which usually takes about one-third of all EU pigmeat exports, virtually closed in the latter part of 1998 because of the financial crisis there. Consumption of pigmeat in the EU has been virtually static and this has not helped matters. Ireland's position was exacerbated by a fire which broke out in a plant in Northern Ireland that was taking about 5,000 pigs a week from pig producers in the Border region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of all these factors, Irish pig producers are experiencing a drop in income because of the low prices on the market. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is fully aware of this but, under EU rules, direct financial assistance is classed as a state aid and as such cannot be granted as it is seen to give a trading advantage <Col N="964" /> to the recipients. This avenue, therefore, is not open to the Minister. Any aid to producers must come from the operation of the instruments available under the common organisation of the market for pigmeat, namely, export refunds and aids to private storage.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has taken every legal option open to him. A number of important initiatives to deal with the current difficulties in the pigmeat sector have been taken. On four occasions last year he secured increased export refunds from the EU Commission, the most recent being in November when a 75 per cent increase was given for exports of certain pigmeat products to Russia. These increases have been of considerable help to the market.</P>
    <P>Last September he succeeded in gaining agreement from the Commission for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date about 200,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been temporarily removed from the market throughout the Community. Ireland has over 1,000 tonnes of pigmeat in storage under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year the Council of EU Ministers decided on a food aid package to Russia. This package included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. The EU Commission has recently put in place a regulation for the supply of the first tranche of pigmeat destined for Russia as food aid. This tranche consists of 30,000 tonnes of the total quantity of 100,000 tonnes. Under the regulation, the supply of the meat is to be decided by means of a tendering system which is open to operators on a Community wide basis. The Minister for Agriculture and Food looks forward to a positive response from the pig trade in Ireland in submitting tenders for the supply of this meat. In any event, removing 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market must have a positive effect.</P>
    <P>Due to the continuing difficulties in the pigmeat sector, at a recent Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting the Minister for Agriculture and Food, with many of his ministerial colleagues, requested the EU Commission to hold a special working group as soon as possible to discuss positive actions to address the current weakness in the market. This meeting will take place on 10 February and hopefully proposals will emerge on the best way to bring about improvement in the market.</P>
    <P>In late December last year, the Minister for Agriculture and Food met with the banks and pig feed suppliers to discuss the difficulties in the pigmeat sector. Both organisations expressed their willingness to continue to assist pig producers in every way possible for the duration of the current problems in the sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made, and will continue to make, every possible effort to alleviate the situation in the pigmeat market. He is confident that the measures which have been already put in <Col N="965" /> place regarding export refunds, APS and the Russian food aid programme will result in an improvement in pigmeat prices, leading to a better balance in the pigmeat market, and give all sides of the industry better returns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this matter. An examination of women's participation in employment is timely given that it is 25 years since such legislation was introduced. There has been a dramatic increase in the participation of women but, unfortunately, it has not been accompanied by any great improvement in the number of women reaching the top or near the top in the various areas of employment. This is a cause for serious concern and needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Despite the introduction of legislation and the fact that there is supposed to be equality in this area, there is still a relatively large gap between the earnings of women and men. For example, the average hourly industrial wage for men is £7.72 per hour but only £5.63 an hour for women. I urge the Minister to implement the Employment Equality Act. We completed the legislation in the summer of last year but, to the best of my knowledge, it has not yet been brought into force and we still do not have the necessary equality authority to allow women and the other eight categories included in the Act to exercise their right to equality in the labour force.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that we are currently celebrating the fact that two women have risen to the top of their respective professions in the past week. Ms Ann McGuinness was appointed a county manager &ndash; she is one of 34 county managers, the rest of whom are men &ndash; and Ms Catherine Clancy was recently appointed as a Chief Superintendent in the Garda where there are more than 50 men at the same or higher levels. That is not much of a record. Other figures are no better; women hold only 4 per cent of senior management positions and account for only 4 per cent of university professors. If we look at health boards and a wide variety of other bodies, one will not see many women at the top. We must examine the reasons behind this and see whether we can make changes to eliminate the glass ceiling wherever it exists.</P>
      <P>The Government should provide a lead in this area. Figures made available to me through a reply to a parliamentary question last year indicated that the number of women nominated to State boards by Government actually decreased in 1998. The number of female ministerial appointees was 35 per cent at the time the question was tabled in May. That represented a drop of 1 per cent on the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the run up to Christmas, two important Government task forces were announced. One related to the implementation of Luas and the other to the beef industry. Only one woman was appointed between them. The Government <Col N="966" /> should aim for an equal participation by men and women on such task forces and other Government bodies. If example does not come from the top, we will not get the required response down the line.</P>
    <P>On the issue of child care, I welcome the fact that the report on child care by the Partnership 2000 working group will be published tomorrow and I look forward to seeing solid and useful proposals in it which will assist women to participate in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the parental leave legislation will make any real difference as it is not the paid leave. We were unable to provide for any kind of payment in that legislation other than <i>force majeure</i>. I urge the Minister to take note of the research which has been carried out on this issue. He should examine areas such as the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards and the Garda in which the State has a role to play and is, by and large, the paymaster. There is real scope for intervention in this regard.</P>
    <P>I realise there is another side to the equality agenda. Men must be given their rights in regard to children and child care. It must also be acknowledged that they may be the victims of domestic violence and they must be accorded equal rights in this and other areas. This is a two way process and we have a long way to go. The Minister could start that process by bringing the Employment Equality Act into force immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. There are very few Irish people who are not aware of what has been achieved in terms of equal opportunities for women in the Irish workforce since the enactment of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, more than 20 years ago. There are also very few of us who are entirely happy with the situation with regard to equal opportunities as it stands, and I would include myself in that number. We have achieved a great deal but there is still a long way to go. I am happy to say that my own Department has a role in the forefront of the advancement of the position of women in the workforce and of equal opportunities in employment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern work environment comprises both men and women, some of whom are the sole bread winners while others contribute in equal measure with a partner to the economic support of family and home. The advancement of the position of women in employment has been helped by the partnership approach which we have adopted in relation to economic growth and social inclusion. The Government works with the social partners, including trade unions, employers and other sectoral groups to identify social issues which need to be addressed, to highlight them and to ensure that commitments in this area are followed up. The Partnership 2000 agreement includes commitments in relation to gender equality, child care and family friendly policies, <Col N="967" /> all of which will, as they develop, help the position of women in the workforce. My Department is currently arranging a round table conference on the issue of family friendly employment policies which will involve the principal interested groups, including the social partners, with a view to focusing on progressing such policies in the future.</P>
    <P>The importance of such measures is that they provide a more even playing field on which women and men can compete in the employment market and they work towards the elimination of forms of discrimination which were inherent in the more traditional workplace structures. Because women have traditionally borne the principal responsibility for child rearing, the structure of the world of work has always had the effect of discrimination.</P>
    <P>My Department chaired the expert working group on child care which was established under Partnership 2000 in July 1997 to devise a national framework for the development of child care services in Ireland. The group finalised a report and recommendations in December 1998. The report will be launched tomorrow, 3 February 1999.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a commitment in Partnership 2000 to support the growth of family friendly policies, my Department is arranging for a round table forum on family friendly policies in the workplace to be held on 25 February 1999 involving the social partners, relevant Departments and agencies and a number of public and private sector employers.</P>
    <P>My Department, in co-operation with the EU, has developed a two year equal opportunities child care programme. This programme, which was launched in July 1998, involves expenditure of approximately £6 million and is aimed at developing locally based child care facilities to assist parents to reconcile family and working responsibilities and focuses particularly on the provision of those facilities in disadvantaged areas. Funding is also being provided from the European Social Fund and the Exchequer for the establishment of a national child care database. Furthermore, as a means of encouraging the supply of child care facilities, the 1999 budget included certain provisions for employers and private providers towards the cost of such facilities. In 1971 fewer than 27 per cent of women participated in the labour force. This compares with a participation rate of 45 per cent in 1997. I fully recognise that there has been a falling short in the achievement of equality of opportunities in the workplace for women, particularly with regard to their lack of success in reaching the upper echelons in enterprises. I am only too well aware that when it comes to female employment <Col N="968" /> many of these jobs are concentrated in low paid part-time work. It is to such jobs that many of the new entrants to the workforce, who are primarily women, are recruited.</P>
    <P>The number of women in key decision making roles in our public and private organisations is increasing but it is still too low. Women remain under-represented at board level in our major manufacturing and industrial concerns and it will be obvious to most of us that men continue to occupy the majority of management, professional and supervisory positions in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, which will come into operation later this year, makes specific provision for positive action programmes in the workplace on grounds of gender. Measures like these, combined with a close examination of greater flexibility in the workplace to which I have already referred, will ensure that the position of women in the workplace continues to improve. The Government's commitment to achieving greater gender balance on State boards has already seen a change from a position where, in 1992, women represented 17 per cent of Government appointees on State boards and 15 per cent of overall membership of State boards to a situation in 1998 where women represented 34 per cent of Government appointees to State boards and 28 per cent of the total. The Government's stated aim is that there will be a gender balance of at least 49 per cent on all State boards.</P>
    <P>I would not like to give the impression to this House that I or my colleagues in Government are entirely happy with the greater progress for women's advancement in the workforce to date. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that considerable progress has been made and that each day and week that passes more progress is made.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which continues to cause concern is the disparity between hourly rates of pay between men and women. In this regard my Department has commissioned the ESRI to undertake a study of the situation which I expect will be published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The task of creating a genuinely discrimination free workplace is one to which this Government and my Department are committed. The existing employment equality legislation, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which strengthens it, will continue to have a beneficial effect both in changing attitudes to discrimination in the workplace and in improving the participation rates of women at all levels. However, the elimination of overt discrimination is not enough. It is necessary to re-examine the structure of the world of work to see if we can redesign it for the benefit of women, of men and of families and society as a whole.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the farm assist scheme is not being introduced immediately in view of the current financial distress of many farmers; and the amount allocated to this scheme for 1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2705/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): The new farm assist scheme, which was announced in the 1999 budget, represents an important new development in the provision of income support for farmers. While the impetus for its introduction stemmed from the current difficulties facing low-income farmers, it must be recognised that the scheme is not a temporary one related to the current situation, but will become an ongoing feature of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, to provide a legislative basis for the new scheme and the necessary preparatory work has been under way in my Department for some time. The legislative provisions will be contained in the Social Welfare Bill, 1999 which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Apart from the requirement to provide for the scheme in legislation, the Deputy will appreciate that there are a range of operational measures which must be put in place to cater for the new scheme. Given that means-testing of farm incomes is intensive and time-consuming, a re-allocation of resources and priorities within my Department is required. It is necessary also to ensure that the appropriate arrangements in relation to the information technology and accounting systems are in place.</P>
    <P>As regards funding, the 1999 budget provides for a full year additional allocation of £15 million to meet the costs of the new scheme. Against that background, I am taking all possible steps to ensure that the farm assist scheme is successfully implemented at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The House will be pleased to know that the Government has today decided to provide for entitlement to payment under the farm assist scheme from the first week of April 1999. To allow for the necessary means testing and other preparatory work, payments under the scheme will begin from 26 May 1999. I am pleased to announce that the Government has decided to allocate an additional £5 million to the scheme in 1999, bringing the total allocation for this year to £10 million.</P>
    <P>In the context of the immediate needs of farmers, I should mention that my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food, are engaged in urgent discussions aimed at devising appropriate measures to assist farmers who are experiencing difficulties due to scarcity of winter fodder.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that it is open to farmers on <Col N="970" /> low incomes to apply now for the income support available under the unemployment assistance (smallholders assistance) scheme and I would urge them to do so. Similarly, existing claimants may apply to have their means reassessed at any time if they consider that their income has deteriorated since they were last subject to a means assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>An amount of £42 million is provided in my Department's 1999 Estimates to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus for approximately 715,000 recipients of long-term social welfare payments. This estimate is based on the payment of a bonus in 1999 similar to the bonus paid in 1998 and earlier years, i.e. 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of the following payments:</P>
      <P>&ndash;disablement pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;death benefit by way of pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;old age (contributory and non-contributory) pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;retirement pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;invalidity pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;orphan's (contributory and non-contributory) pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;pre-retirement allowance,</P>
      <P>&ndash;blind pension,</P>
      <P>&ndash;carer's allowance,</P>
      <P>&ndash;one parent family payment,</P>
      <P>&ndash;unemployment assistance at the long-term rate,</P>
      <P>&ndash;disability allowance,</P>
      <P>&ndash;payment to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Christmas bonus is payable to recipients of long-term social welfare schemes. It is not payable to people in receipt of short-term payments such as disability benefit or unemployment bene<Col N="971" /> fit. I have no plans at the present time to extend the bonus payment to these categories this year.</P>
    <P>Any change in the amount of the bonus or in the categories of persons to whom it is paid would have substantial cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and commitments.</P>

      <Quest>if the review relating to the backdating of late social welfare claims prior to 1 January 1997 has been completed; and, if so, the policy changes, if any, proposed in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>People claiming social welfare payments are required to make their claim within a specified period of time. Where a claim is not made in time, payment can only be backdated for a specified period, the duration of which varies with the type of claim. The specified period in the case of retirement, old age (contributory), widow's and widower's (contributory) pension was extended in the 1997 Social Welfare Act to 12 months, for claims made on or after 1 January 1997. This means that full arrears may be paid for up to 12 months prior to the date of claim in such cases.</P>
      <P>Under subsequent regulations which I made in February last, a proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid for those who made claims on or after 1 January 1997. These regulations also provide for the payment of full arrears, in cases where claims are delayed due to <i>force majeure</i>, proven incapacity on the part of the applicant or to departmental error and to alleviate current financial hardship.</P>
      <P>While these provisions represented a considerable improvement on the previous position, I was concerned that a significant number of pensioners who had applied for pension, prior to 1 January 1997, did not benefit from these improvements. I am happy to say, therefore, that provision was made in the recent budget for the payment of proportionate arrears of pension in the case of late claims made prior to 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>Payment of arrears of pension due under the new arrangements has been made recently to more than 340 pensioners. Work is under way to identify and pay other pensioners where such arrears payments may be due.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>A large number of circulars issue from my Department in the course of any one year. The majority of these relate to unemployment payments schemes, in respect of which a total of 86 circulars issued in 1998. These circulars contain guidance and advice on interpretation and procedural issues involved in the implementation of new schemes and the administration of existing schemes. Circulars issue in relation to existing schemes when changes and improvements are made or when it becomes apparent that an existing scheme is not being administered correctly.</P>
      <P>My Department has a duty of care to the users of its services to ensure that they are treated in a fair and equal manner, consistent with the relevant legislation, regardless of which office or official is dealing with their case. Circulars play a crucial role in achieving this.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the confusion and uncertainty which attended the making of additional payments to social welfare recipients in 1998. Christmas bonus payments are provided by my Department to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, such as old age pension, at a cost of about £40 million. The circulars which issued to health boards prior to last Christmas had absolutely nothing to do with these payments.</P>
      <P>I made it quite clear at the time that the circulars issued to health boards had nothing to do with any cutbacks for the simple reason that there are no cutbacks. It is not true to suggest that the circular issued to health boards instructed them not to pay a Christmas bonus to thousands of people on supplementary welfare allowance. As the Deputy should be aware, there is no actual &ldquo;Christmas bonus&rdquo; payment with supplementary welfare allowance SWA, provided for in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are empowered, and indeed are obliged, to make once-off payments to people who are faced with an exceptional need, including the additional costs which arise at Christmas time. They are also obliged to assess each individual's needs on a case by case basis. However, practice evolved differently in the eight health boards, giving rise to anomalies, inequitable treatment of people in similar financial circumstances and a failure to make payments in some instances to <Col N="973" /> people who were entitled to additional financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the circulars issued to the health boards was to ensure that all supplementary welfare allowance recipients received their full entitlements to additional payments at Christmas time in accordance with the relevant legislation in a fair, equal and consistent manner regardless of which health board was dealing with their case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of circulars generally, I have arranged that the systems in place in the Department for approval and issue of circulars be strengthened with a view to minimising any potential misunderstandings which may arise, particularly given the size of the social welfare system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of means tests for different social welfare schemes and, while the means testing criteria are broadly similar, there are significant variations in the way certain items are assessed. Some progress has been achieved in recent years in the integration and consolidation of schemes in the process of which some progress was made in consolidating aspects of the means tests. For example, administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, now known as the disability allowance, was transferred to my Department from the health borads and the schemes of payments to prisoners wives, deserted wives and lone parents have been consolidated into the oneparent family payment.</P>
      <P>Apart from integration of scheme rules I am giving a high priority to simplifying the administrative procedures for the collection of means data and reducing the amount of duplication in this area.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Social Welfare Act provided for a single personal public service number, public service card and for the sharing of information across Government Departments and specified public bodies for the purposes of determining entitlement to benefits. This will, as it is implemented, reduce duplication and improve the quality of services to the public while enabling departments and state agencies to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation enables the exchange of means data betwen the various agencies and this will reduce considerably the need for people to undergo multiple means tests when claming their entitlements. My Department plans to develop a central means data base which, under specified circumstances, can be accessed by the various agencies where a customer has made a claim for a benefit or allowance. This will result in improved <Col N="974" /> access and quicker service to customers dealing with public sector organisations.</P>
    <P>Some progress on developing the objective of data sharing is already under way. As part of the integrated services project launched recently by An Taoiseach, a pilot scheme will be conducted in one area on data sharing between my Department and a health board.</P>
    <P>The objective is to collect the data at first point of contact and to subsequently share this information between both organisations for the purpose of determining entitlement across a number af schemes. This pilot will help in identifying the issues and outcomes of the process of data-sharing and will provide valuable information as we progress to other areas.</P>
    <P>My Department will, in addition, continue to seek to simplify the administration of means tests in the interests of improving the quality of service to customers while at the same time ensuring that their specific circumstances are adequately catered for in whatever method we use for determining entitlement.</P>

Payment of disability benefit was disallowed by deciding officers of my Department following examinations of the person concered by medical assessors in October 1994 and in September 1995. Appeals officers from the independent social welfare appeals office upheld those decisions.</P>
      <P>In determining the appeals, the appeals officers carefully considered all the available evidence including that adduced at oral hearings held on 2 March 1995 and 21 March 1996. They were satisfied that his medical condition was not such as to render him incapable of work within the meaning of the relevant social welfare legislation. The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the person concerned has continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity and, with a view to establishing if there was any deterioration in his medical condition, he has been examined by a medical assessor on five occasions since September 1995.

      <Quest>if he has examined the family credit scheme in Northern Ireland which is available to self-employed families who are badly off; his views on whether there are many such families in this country; and his further views on whether there is a strong case for such a scheme here based on the Northern Ireland scheme or by way of an extension of the family income supplement to the self-employed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the family credit scheme, which operates in Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom, includes provision for the self-employed. I should say that the scheme differs significantly from the family income supplement scheme in the manner in which the income supplement is calculated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the family income supplement scheme was introduced here in 1984 with the specific purpose of providing an incentive to low paid employees with families to take up or remain in full time employment. The problems relating to incentives were seen, at the time, as being more acute for employees than for self-employed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the intervening years, the question of extending the scheme to cover the self-employed, including farmers, has been considered on a number of occasions. Such consideration would have <Col N="976" /> regard to a range of factors including the practical difficulties associated with extending the scheme to the self-employed, the arrangements already in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes; and, most notably, the cost of introducing such a measure in the context of the need to prioritise the use of the limited resources available for the development of wider social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a separate social assistance scheme, farm assist, is being introduced in 1999 to provide income support to low-income farmers. If FIS were to be extended to all other self-employed people, the costs involved have been estimated to amount to some  £47 million, assuming substantial take-up. The potential number of beneficiaries is estimated to be of the order of 21,000.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the existence of the family credit scheme which operates in Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom, the Deputy will appreciate that the question of extending the family income supplement scheme to the self-employed must be considered on its own merits and take account of the factors I have outlined and, in particular, the high costs involved.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and-or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was initially allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. I am satisfied that this level of funding was sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again last year.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made avail<Col N="977" /> able for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people have been assisted in 1998.</P>
    <P>Full details of funding provided to voluntary groups and organisations under the scheme of community support for older people up to and including 1997 are held in the Dáil Library for the information of Members. Details of grants paid to groups under the 1998 scheme are currently being compiled and will be available in the Dáil Library shortly.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The school meals scheme is a statutory scheme which assists in the provision of free school meals to certain children attending national schools in specified areas.</P>
      <P>While my Department has policy and legal responsibility for the school meals scheme, the scheme is administered by local authorities. My Department has no function in initiating school meals programmes in schools. Its function is confined to reimbursing local authorities up to a maximum of 50 per cent of their expenditure on the provision of such meals and approving participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1997 my Department engaged independent consultants to undertake a full review of the school meals scheme. The consultants report was received by my Department in 1998 and was circulated to the Department of Education and Science and other relevant parties. The report recommended that the scheme should be administered by the Department of Education and Science. My Department intends to initiate a formal evaluation of the school meals scheme shortly, using the consultants report as a basis for that examination.</P>

      <P>The aim of the child income support policy followed by successive Governments in recent years has been to ensure that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that it is widely accepted that child benefit represents a very effective mechanism for the provision of child income support. It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families with children and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, we have channelled substantial additional resources into the child benefit scheme in pursuance of this policy. The full year costs of the increases provided for in the 1998 budget amount to some £28.4 million while the 1999 budget includes a full year provision of over £40 million.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the family income supplement, FIS, scheme has been enhanced as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children. From October of last year, in line with a commitment made in the Partnership 2000 agreement, FIS has been reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as had previously been the case. This measure significantly increases the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of December 1998 <Col N="979" /> there were 11,416 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance at an annual cost of over £45 million. I have met with various organisations representing carers on a number of occasions and I am aware of their views, concerns and priorities in relation to carers</P>
    <P>In its An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>As part of that commitment, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was launched by me in October 1998.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the review and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, I introduced a range of measures in the 1999 budget, at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. To allow more carers to qualify for the allowance, the scope of the scheme is being extended in two important areas, to take effect from August 1999. The first of these is that all carers who are caring for someone between the age of 16 and 65 can now apply for a carer's allowance, regardless of the source of income of the care recipient. The second extension is to include carers who are looking after children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance from the health boards. It is estimated that over 2,700 carers will qualify from these measures.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of respite care for carers, a new annual payment of £200 will be automatically made to all carers in receipt of a qualifying payment to use as they see fit. This payment will be made in June and will benefit over 11,500 carers. In addition, all carers in receipt of a qualifying payment will be entitled, from August 1999, to a free telephone rental allowance regardless of their household composition.</P>
    <P>The residency and full-time care and attention requirements are being eased to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme, while still safeguarding the needs and interests of the care recipients. The residency requirements will be relaxed to allow for carers broadly &lsquo;living next door' to qualify. The full-time care and attention requirements will also be relaxed to allow carers to work for up to ten hours per week.</P>
    <P>Carers in receipt of a carer's allowance or carers who are caring for a person in receipt of a prescribed relative allowance or constant attendance allowance will now be considered to be qualified carers and will benefit from the measures announced.</P>
    <P>Other measures being introduced include the extension of a £75 income disregard to carers in their own right, the preservation of carers' social <Col N="980" /> insurance records and the extension of the free travel pass to all qualified carers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, the rate of carer's allowance will increase in June this year by £3 per week for recipients of the allowance who are under age 66 and by £6 per week for those who are over age 66. This represents an increase of 4.1 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively on current rates.</P>
    <P>The review considered that a needs assessment, encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer, should be introduced. This would separate care needs from income support and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. The Government has agreed that a working group, to be chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children and comprising membership from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the health boards and other relevant Departments, be set up to advance this proposal as quickly as possible. This is currently being progressed by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a PRSI carer's benefit to facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care. The review envisaged that this would be financed through the PRSI system. The proposal would, for example, require an increase of the order of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points in each of the current employee and employer PRSI rates depending on the level of the Exchequer contribution. This proposal, at a cost of £42 million, deserves further full examination and I would be interested in the views of the social partners in this regard. </P>
    <P>Looking towards the longer term, a further PRSI benefit arrangement for care recipients i.e. those in need of care was also proposed in the review. Given that there is a high probability that many of us will need some from of long-term care, such an arrangement could enable care recipients to meet some or all of the costs of their own care. The Government agreed, given the complexity of the issues raised, that this proposal should be pursued at both the policy and operational levels as a separate consultancy project and my Department will be progressing this later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should also say that my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Goverment is conscious that such a cross-cuting approach is required.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme, administered by my Department, is available to all people resident in Ireland, irrespective of nationality, aged 66 years or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At the end of December 1998, free travel passes had been issued to over 530,000 people at an estimated annual cost of over £32 million. The scheme was extended in 1995 to cover cross-Border travel only between Ireland and Nothern Ireland. It is available to passholders in Ireland, their spouses or companions in the case of people holding companion passes, and to Northern Ireland concession travel passholders. The scheme does not apply to either sea or air routes between this country and Great Britian.</P>
      <P>I understand that the question of introducing a senior euro pass or euro card for senior citizens which would grant a wide range of concessions, including transport, across the European Union is being dealt with by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission. At the end of 1997 Age Concern England completed a study of this matter with the support of the EU Commission and I am informed that Commission is currently considering this report. No formal proposal regarding the introduction of a senior euro pass has been received by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system has been built up over many years with new benefits and allowances added to meet different needs and contingencies which have arisen from time to time and which, in some cases, reflect the changing nature of our society. The qualifying conditions and payments for the individual schemes are designed to reflect the perceived needs of each target group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women who have withdrawn from the labour force and who are engaged on home duties are provided for in the social welfare system through the payment of qualified adult allowances where their spouses or partners are in receipt of a social welfare payment. Such allowances are payable under nearly all the schemes operated by my <Col N="982" /> Department. The qualified adult allowance is paid at about 60 per cent of the full personal rate, which is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, 1986, and is designed to reflect the fact that it is considered that there are economies of scale where two people are living together. This is the traditional way in which couples are provided for under social welfare systems in many countries.</P>
    <P>Measures are being taken to improve the position of those who take time out from the workforce to mind children. From 6 April 1994, special arrangements for homemakers were introduced to help people who work in the home to qualify for old age contributory pension. From that date, contribution years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of 6, which was increased to age 12 from April 1995, or incapacitated people, may be disregarded when calculating the yearly average number of contributions. A maximum of 20 years can be disregarded in this way. I would also point out that my Department shortly will be undertaking a review of the provision to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pension purposes. This is in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>In relation to retirement and old age contributory pensions, each of a couple may qualify for payment in his or her own right, depending on the social insurance record. In this context, the number fo women qualifying for these pensions in their own right is likely to increase, reflecting the increase in the number of women paying social insurance as a result of the number of women who are now entering-re-entering the workforce and the operation of the homemaker's provisions. In relation to the non-contributory old age pension, each person of a couple is entitled to a separate pension where he/she is over 66 years of age. Where both persons are over pension age, each will receive the same level of pension in his/her own right.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Family has also considered the position of parents taking time out of the workforce to care for children and put forward a number of different suggestions designed to recognise the valuable work performed by these parents and to provide direct support when their childcare responsibilities are at their most demanding. Their suggestions include enhanced child benefit, a parenting allowance and a PRSI based parental leave scheme.</P>
    <P>The validity of the traditional method of catering for adult dependants in the social welfare code has been called into question in recent years. It is felt in many quarters that entitlements should not be derived from spouses or partners and that there should be more financial recognition for the very valuable role played in society by those who, for example, choose to withdraw from the paid workforce to provide full-time care for their children. This poses many difficult and com<Col N="983" /> plex issues, not just for the social welfare system, but also for the taxation system.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, is currently examining the treatment of different types of households under both the social welfare and tax systems. The group is, among other things, charged with identifying and costing ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of different types of households including married, co-habiting and one-parent households under both systems. As part of its work the group is reviewing previous reports in this area, including that of the Commission on the Family, some of whose recommendations I have already mentioned. The establishment of this group also marks the first stage in meeting the commitment in the national anti-poverty strategy to examine the individualisation of social welfare payments. The group will complete its work in the next few months and we must await the report to see what measures are proposed before deciding on further action.</P>
    <P>With regard to the community employment schemes I am anxious to see as many people and categories of welfare recipients as possible participating on such schemes and progressing from them to paid employment. However, the qualifying conditions for community employment are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>Free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone, or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition. In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A change in the qualifying conditions for the free schemes was introduced in the 1996 budget. This allowed new applicants over age 75, who were previously required to satisfy more rigourous household composition rules, to be assessed in the same way as all other persons in that age category. This means that their household composition will not affect their eligibility for the free schemes. Effectively now all persons over age 75 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment may qualify for the free schemes. In addition, the free schemes were extended in July 1996 to include low-income pensioners who were not in receipt of a social welfare type payment. The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is <Col N="984" /> the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension currently £83 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
    <P>The fuel schemes are historically different in nature to the free schemes and, therefore, qualification conditions differ significantly. The fuel scheme is a means-tested payment which is not age-related. The free schemes, on the other hand, are mainly payable to pensioners.</P>
    <P>The national fuel scheme and the smokeless fuel scheme are tailored to provide assistance to qualified householders who are unable to provide for their own solid fuel heating needs. Persons who are in receipt of a means-tested payment automatically satisfy the means test for these payments. However, in the case of contributory pensioners, if they and members of their household have a combined income of more than £15 per week or savings or investments of £8,000 or more above the appropriate maximum Irish contributory pension rate, they do not qualify for either of the fuel schemes. The income limit will be increased to £30 per week in excess of the maximum pension rate from October 1999.</P>
    <P>It is intented to undertake a review of the free schemes, commencing early this year, and the matter raised will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 94 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board report, Securing Retirement Income, on the national pensions policy initiative is a comprehensive and detailed document.</P>
      <P>The Government broadly welcomed the thrust and recommendations of the report as set out in its response, Action on Pensions, published when the report was launched in May 1998. To progress the main recommendations made by the Pensions Board in the report, working groups have been set up as follows:&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)to examine fully the recommendation for an explicit mechanism to fund, at least partially, the substantial future costs of social welfare <Col N="985" /> pensions. This group is chaired by the Department of Finance and I understand that it hopes to report before mid year;</P>
    <P>(b)to progress the recommendation to increase Second Pillar coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this &ndash; namely, the personal retirement savings accounts  PRSAs. The Government has accepted this recommendation, in principle and the working group, which is chaired by my own Department, is currently examining the issues involved;</P>
    <P>(c)to further examine and advance the proposals to introduce a simplified and more flexible tax regime for pensions. Again, this was accepted, in principle, by the Government and the third working group, which is chaired by the Department of Finance, is considering this matter with a view to making the necessary legislative changes. This group is also examining issues relating to annuity purchase and the question of an earnings cap in relation to tax relief on pensions; and</P>
    <P>(d)to bring forward proposals in relation to an effective awareness/education programme. Again, the Government is supportive of the proposals in this regard. The importance of clear and easily understandable information in the pensions area cannot be underestimated. I understand that an initial report on this from the Pensions Board will be submitted to me shortly. Each of the above groups comprises representatives of the relevant Government Departments and the Executive of the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>The Government also accepted the board's proposals for legislative changes regarding occupational pensions in relation to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation.</P>
    <P>I hope to bring forward a comprehensive Pensions Bill later this year dealing among other things with these issues and incorporating the recommendations of the various working groups, with a view to enactment during 2000.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board report also recommended that social welfare pensions be increased over a five to ten year period and building on the Government's commitment, to 34 per cent of average industrial earnings. In this regard, I would remind the House that the Government, as a key priority of its action programme for older people, is committed to increasing the old age pension to £100 per week by 2002. Budget '99 delivered increases of over 7 per cent in personal pension rates &ndash; well above the predicted, average inflation rate and, when taken together with the improvements in Budget '98, represents a 14 per cent increase since this Government came into office.</P>

      <P>The recent budget package represents the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation, amounting to over £305 million on a full year basis. Among the major improvements included in the package are a £6 weekly increase in the personal rates of pension for people over 66 and for those over 65 on retirement and invalidity pension, together with a £3 increase in the qualified adult allowance payable with old age, retirement and invalidity pensions; a £3 weekly increase in the personal rates for other social welfare recipients under 66 years, together with a £2 increase in the qualified adult allowance; additional increases for those on the lowest rates so as to bring all social welfare rates above the Commission on Social Welfare's target rate; a £3 increase in the monthly child benefit for each of the first two children, with a £4 increase per month for each other child; a major package of improvements for carers costing £18 million in a full year, including the introduction of an annual once-off payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care; the introduction of a special 50 per cent pension for certain self-employed people who were aged 56 and over in April 1988 and who have at least five years PRSI contributions since then; the payment of arrears on a sliding scale on late claims for contributory pensions made pre-January 1997; and the introduction of a new means-tested farm assist scheme to help low income farmers.</P>
      <P>In addition to these budget improvements, I have recently announced a five-fold increase in the death grant from £100 to £500 to assist families in the payment of funeral expenses, at an extra cost of £10 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The cost of the various increases in weekly social welfare payments, including FIS improvements, in the 1999 budget amounts to almost £206 million on a full year basis. The additional cost of bringing these increases forward by eight weeks to 6 April 1999 would amount to almost £32 million.</P>
      <P>The question of the level of future increases to be provided, together with the effective dates of those increases, are matters to be decided in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of income adequacy is one which is being addressed in a number of contexts both within my Department and at the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. Indeed, income adequacy is one of the five key themes of the national anti-poverty strategy which is being implemented across all Government Departments.</P>
      <P>Adequate rates of payment must be a central objective of income support. As the national anti-poverty strategy states, income support policies should aim to provide all those concerned with sufficient income to enable them to live in a manner compatible with human dignity.</P>
      <P>As regards social welfare payments, current policy is determined having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000, and the national anti-poverty strategy. The recent budget increases mean that all rates of payment will be at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. In   addition, a substantial step was made towards increasing the old age contributory pension to £100 by 2002,</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget also provided significant increases in child benefit &ndash; £3 per month for the first and second children and £4  per month for subsequent children which will benefit some 513,000 families with a total of 1.2 million children. Changes to the family income supplement which provide for calculation on a net income rather than a gross income basis, as well as increases in the weekly income thresholds announced in the 1999 budget, will also be of significant help to many low income households.</P>
      <P>Similarly, low income farmers will benefit from a new scheme specifically geared towards supporting those most in need. The new scheme &ndash; farm assist &ndash; will cover around 13,600 people, including existing smallholders unemployment assistance recipients, at a cost of £45 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is intended, in the context of NAPS, to consider the issue of income adequacy in its broad sense, including the areas of taxation, employment, etc. In this regard, my Department intends to examine the role of social welfare rates and, in particular, the appropriate future direction for social welfare payments, now that the Commission on Social Welfare's minimum rates have been achieved. This examination will also take account of other considerations, notably incentives to employment, budgetary considerations, etc.</P>

      <P>Detailed information on the total expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the years 1992 to 1999 is set out on the following tabular statement, which I will make available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the last few years. This was mainly due to increases in rent levels rather than recipient numbers. In July 1996, following the publication of the housing review group report, an interdepartmental committee was established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to examine the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to the the local authorities. It comprises representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Finance as well as the Environment and Local Government. I understand that the committee will report shortly. Any further development of these schemes will be considered in the light of the findings of that report.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eli<Col N="989" /> gible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, the person must satisfy a means test. A person may have a combined household income of up to £15 per week over and above the maximum rate of the relevant pension or benefit and still qualify for the fuel allowance. That £15 additional income limit will be increased to £30 from the commencement of the next heating season in October this year. Improvements in the rate payable cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments ranging between £3 to £6 per week effective from June 1999 were announced in the recent budget. Any extension of the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications. To extend the scheme for a further two weeks to the end of April would cost £4 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 Social Welfare Act provided for the introduction of a new means tested sickness allowance scheme. This scheme is intended to bridge the gap which exists in the social welfare code whereby people who are incapable of work due to illness but do not satisfy the contribution conditions for disability benefit or the qualifying conditions for disability allowance must have recourse to the supplementary welfare allowance in order to secure income support.</P>
      <P>It was originally envisaged that the sickness allowance scheme would commence late in 1997. However, the level of computer systems development work which would be required to introduce this scheme is such that it could jeopardise the critical work which is necessary in order to ensure that all of the Department's computer based payments systems are fully prepared for the year 2000 and for the introduction of the euro. Accordingly, it has been necessary to defer the introduction of the scheme, pending progress on these preparations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the sickness allowance scheme, there are six separate payments being administered by my Department for people who are ill and people with disabilities. Accordingly, the potential for the rationalisation of the Department's range of income supports, including the introduction of a sickness allowance scheme, will be examined during this year. This examination will have to have regard to the cost of any proposals, the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to overhaul the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities and the recommendations con<Col N="990" /> tained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy, however, that all those who would have qualified for the sickness allowance payment are currently being catered for through other social welfare payments such as supplementary welfare allowance and are not therefore losing out financially as a result of the deferred implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have announced the introduction of a special old age contributory pension for a very specific group of people. These are self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed. As a result, this group narrowly failed to qualify for a pension, through no fault of their own, as they did not satisfy the requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. The pension is not being extended to employees as that group are not in the same insurability position as the self-employed group.</P>
      <P>Title to this new pension will be created from April next and payment will commence from October. It will be payable to those self-employed who were aged 56 or over when they entered social insurance in April 1988 and who have at least five years reckonable contributions paid since then.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, both self-employed and employed people can qualify for a standard old age contributory pension if they satisfy the qualifying conditions, namely, that they have entered social insurance before reaching the age of 56; have 156 full employment contributions paid, from April 2002, this will increase to a minimum of 260 paid contributions and to a minimum of 520 from April 2012; and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, paid and or credited from 1953, or the time they started insurable employment, if later, to the end of the tax year prior to reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>Where a person fails to satisfy the yearly average qualifying condition, he or she may qualify for a pro rata old age contributory pension, which was introduced in November 1997, if the yearly average is between ten and 19 and at least 260 contributions have been paid in total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, where a person fails to satisfy the qualifying conditions at 2 and 3 above, he or she may qualify for a mixed insurance pro rata pension if a mixture of full rate and modified rate social insurance contributions has been paid. In line with the Government's commitment to address the issue of people who fail marginally to <Col N="991" /> qualify for an old age contributory penion, my Department will shortly be carrying out a comprehensive review of the qualifying conditions for receipt of both the retirement and old age contributory pensions. The review will pay particular attention to the operation of the yearly average qualifying condition, including the possibility of using contributions paid prior to 1953 and to the commitment given in our action programme to provide a mechanism to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pension purposes. I will report to the House on the outcome of that review in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. The main purpose of the SWA scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes and for people confronted with an emergency situation, such as, for example, a fire in the family home.</P>
      <P>SWA weekly payment rates are the lowest within the social welfare system as the SWA scheme is not intended to meet long-term or recurring needs. Instead, where such needs are identified, relevant existing schemes are enhanced and new schemes are developed in a manner that is specifically tailored to the needs in question. Such schemes typically have either a more generous means test or higher weekly payment rates than SWA or both, thus ensuring that the individuals and families are better off than they would be on SWA.</P>
      <P>Farmers are not debarred from seeking assistance under the SWA scheme but the unemployment assistance smallholder's assistance scheme is the primary means through which the social welfare system provides for the needs of farmers on low incomes. In the event that a person does not qualify for an unemployment payment or is awaiting a decision on his claim, he or she can apply for SWA at their local health centre and the community welfare officer will assess them on the basis of their present circumstances and immediate needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met representatives from the farming community to discuss possible entitlements of farmers under social welfare schemes including SWA, and my officials are in regular contact with <Col N="992" /> farmers' representatives on this matter. In addition, information on SWA is available to the farming community through the national network of over 800 health centres, from any of my Department's Information Officers and from Community Information Centres, supported by the National Social Service Board which operates under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the 1999 budget provided for the introduction of a new social assistance scheme designed to provide enhanced income support to farmers on low incomes. Details of the scheme, which will be known as farm assist, will be contained in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, 1999.</P>
    <P>I should mention finally that in the context of the immediate needs of farmers affected by the very adverse weather in recent months, the Deputy may be aware that my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food, are engaged in urgent discussions aimed at devising appropriate measures to assist farmers who are experiencing difficulties due to scarcity of winter fodder.</P>

      <P>The introduction of net income assessment for the purpose of determining entitlement to family income supplement (FIS) commenced on 1 October 1998. This change has already had a positive effect on the number of families qualifying for this supplement. There are now 13,555 FIS recipients, the highest number recorded since the scheme was introduced in 1984. It is envisaged therefore that the numbers in payment will show a significant increase in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>Whilst the number of new FIS claims has significantly increased since the introduction of this measure, the necessary arrangements have been put in place to process claims expeditiously. If the Deputy is aware of any specific problems in this regard my Department will be happy to discuss the matter with him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 112 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>The final report of the Commission on the Family &ldquo;Strengthening Families for Life&rdquo; was published by the Government in July 1998</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to adopting a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies. In line with this pro-family approach as set out in the programme for Government &ndash; An Action Programme for the Millennium and in response to the recommendations of the commission, the Government established the Family Affairs Unit in my Department. The Family Affairs Unit has a specific function to pursue the findings in the commission report following their consideration by the Government. The unit also has responsibility for the co-ordination of family policy and for the development of a number of services for families in line with the Government programme.</P>
      <P>This year £6.5 million has been allocated specifically for the development of these family services, compared to £1.5 million in 1997, i.e., an increase of £5 million. This includes £21 million for marriage and child counselling. It is expected that over 250 groups providing these services will receive grants this year. I have broadened the programme to include voluntary organisations providing marriage preparation programmes and those providing bereavement counselling and support services. An allocation of £60,000 is being made this year to rainbows programmes which provide a very special type of support to children who experience the loss of a parent, through death or separation.</P>
      <P>It includes an extra £200,000 for the continued development of the family mediation service. The framework for the nationwide service as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium is now in  place. The family mediation service is now providing services from regional centres in Cork, Tralee, Wexford, Athlone, Dundalk and Galway in addition to those in Dublin and Limerick.</P>
      <P>It also includes an extra £1 million for the family and community services resource centre programme which will allow an additional 15 to 20 centres to be initiated in 1999. By the end of this year some 50 centres will be funded under the programme, under which ten centres were being funded at the beginning of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater investment in the marriage counselling services and an expansion of the family mediation <Col N="994" /> service were key recommendations of the Commission on the Family in their consideration for what needs to be done to prevent marital breakdown and to support the ongoing parenting relationships which are so important for children if their parents separate. Enhancement of the family and community services resources centre programme was also recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>Resources have been allocated for the development of a number of initiatives by the Family Affairs Unit in 1999 including undertaking research, a pilot programme in relation to the local offices of the Department building on the one stop shop concept with the aim of providing improved support at local level to families and the introduction of a parenting programme on parenting issues. The commission in its report made recommendations in relation to the development of these important services for families.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget provides very significant resources for improvements for pensioners &ndash; some £136 million, full year cost, carers &ndash; some £18 million, full year cost and child benefit, some £40.7 million, full year cost.</P>
    <P>Improvements in these areas, which were prioritised in the programme for Government, together with improvements in the family income supplement and in employment support measures for long-term unemployed people address areas highlighted by the commission in its report.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recommendations of direct relevance to my own Department, there are substantial recommendations in relation to the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These departments were represented on the commission.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are progressing a number of significant policy issues in their own areas of responsibility in line with the Government's pro-families approach. The Minister for Education and Science has a number of initiatives under way in relation to early education, investment at primary level in schools and in tackling educational disadvantage. Progress has been made in relation to the introduction of parental leave and investment in childcare projects in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil report of 30 September 1998 my colleagues have set out the initiatives taken within their own areas of responsibility in relation to the findings of the Commission on the Family. In carrying out its responsibilities to co-ordinate family policy developments and to pursue the findings of the Commission on the Family, the family affairs unit is working closely with other Departments which are affected by the Commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have also taken steps to ensure that the commission's report is discussed widely around the country. Many Deputies will have received invitations to the Family Services Information Fora which are being held throughout the country. I, <Col N="995" /> along with the Taoiseach, requested that these fora take place so that discussion could take place on the findings of the commission's report as well as family policy developments in general. The series has been organised by the Family Affairs Unit. They also provide voluntary and community groups with an opportunity to hear about the new family services and to discuss the issues and concerns which these groups encounter in their work in support of families.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to set out a suitable timescale for the implementation of the commission's report. The commission's recommendations in the main relate to the approach to be pursued in various areas of policy in the years ahead to strengthen families in carrying out their functions. Some of the commission's recommendations are set in the context of evolving societal change in relation to family life. Some recommendations involve very substantial costs and these recommendations will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context in the light of available resources. Some recommendations have been put forward by the commission for consideration in the context of major policy reviews which were under way at the time the commission was undertaking its brief. The recommendation of the Commission on the Family will continue to be considered in the context of developing coherent progressive and effective policies for families as promised in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grants to voluntarty groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As funding under the scheme is provided to voluntary organisations and not to individuals, my Department, in an effort to ensure that as broad a range of voluntary organisations as possible are aware of the scheme, advertises the scheme extensively each year in the national  and provincial press. The main voluntary organisations which have participated in the scheme in previous years such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Munitir na Tíre, etc. are also made aware of the scheme each year. These <Col N="996" /> organisations are proactive in providing support and information to a large number and wide range of vulnerable older people, including the visually impaired, who may be in need of the services provided under the scheme. In addition, the National Social Services Board, NSSB, which is under the aegis of my Department, disseminates information on the scheme to voluntary community-based groups representing vulnerable older people.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly.</P>

    <P>My Department is also conducting a series of integration tests with external key service providers who have computer links to the Department.

This aspect of the project will also be complete by the end of July. In view of the very critical nature of my Department's business, I am also having a full year 2000 business continuity plan prepared for the Department. This plan, which will be delivered in mid 1999, will cover contingency arrangements to be implemented in the event of any disruption to the business caused by the millennium date change. Preparations for the changeover to the new millennium have been very extensive. The Department's year 2000 project, which was initiated in 1996, was planned and managed in a way that ensured there would be no impact on the day to day business of the Department. Because a considerable number of IT staff had to be assigned to the year 2000 project, a number of other projects to improve and update the systems for deliv<Col N="997" /> ery of social welfare payments have had to be deferred.

      <P>With 48 money advice and budgeting service, MABS, projects nationwide, and an additional project coming on-stream this year, my Department is directly involved in activities to combat over-indebtedness in urban and rural areas. The local projects, funded by my Department and managed by a committee drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups, operate in partnership with other relevant agencies. The projects are independent information and advice providers rooted in the local community.</P>
      <P>People availing of the service are, in general, social welfare recipients, low income groups, persons whose circumstances have altered due to marital breakdown, loss of employment, redundancies, death or other stressful events. These events occur in urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The MABS programme budget has grown from £260,000, six projects, in 1992 to £4,210,000, 49 projects, in 1999. I am happy that, since its inception in 1992, MABS has provided a nationwide budget advice service as well as positively influencing major creditors, that is, ESB, credit unions, local authorities and moneylenders. The 1999 budget represents an increase of £1,067,000 on the 1998 figure, some of which will go towards an enhanced service throughout the State. MABS has also played a significant role in influencing legislative change, most importantly in terms of the Consumer Credit Bill, 1996.</P>
      <P>An independent review of the MABS service is currently in progress. This review will consider how the programme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most effective and efficient way possible. It is also intended that this review will be used to agree a strategic plan for the further development of the service so that it fully targets those who need it most. It is anticipated that an interim social impact report on the MABS programme will be available in July this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals process is quasi-judicial. The procedures involved are provided for in the social welfare Acts and regulations. Also, the rules of natural justice, as formulated by case law in the courts and applicable to the operation or administrative tribunals, must be observed at all stages. These statutory procedures are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration.</P>
      <P>The procedures give all parties to the appeal, but principally the appellant, the right to understand fully the basis of the decision under appeal and to make his/her views known. Where necessary, this may involve an oral hearing to afford the person the opportunity to present his/her case in person.</P>
      <P>In some cases these procedures can enable a speedy resolution of the appeal as the deciding officer may make a revised decision on foot of the grounds of appeal. Over 20 per cent of appeals cleared in 1998 were disposed of in that manner.</P>
      <P>The procedures also enable many outstanding issues to be clarified following which the appeals officer may be in a position to make a decision on the basis of the documentary evidence without the need for an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>The appeals procedures are carried out as promptly as possible and an appeal hearing is conducted in as informal a manner as possible consistant with the rights of the appellant being fully protected at all times.</P>
      <P>During 1996 and 1997 there was a build up in the number of appeals on which work was in progress at any time and this position was exacerbated by a considerably higher number of appeals being received in 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>Four appeals officer appointments were made in the second half of 1997. Appeals officers are appointed from the assistant principal grade and where such resources become available they are used to best effect throughout the Department, including assignment to the social welfare appeals office. Over 1,000 more appeals were determined in 1998 than in 1997.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to appeals is kept under constant review by the chief appeals officer and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social insurance fund is central to the provision of social welfare services and to the economic and social life of the country. The fund provides for the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and also for benefits to people who are affected by a range of contingencies such as illness or unemployment. The social insurance fund is the primary method of funding social welfare pensions and contributory pension expenditure represents approximately 69 per cent of the total expenditure from the fund. I am fully committed to safeguarding the long-term security of the fund and, in recognition of the importance of the pensions area generally, a number of important developments have already taken place.</P>
      <P>The actuarial review of social welfare pensions, which I launched in September 1997, covers the period from 1996 to 2056. This report is a major contribution to the debate regarding future social welfare pension provision. While the report concludes that the funding provision in respect of pensions, given current contribution levels, is relatively stable for the next 20 years, it also shows that the position thereafter, when a large increase in the number of older people is projected, is more serious. Following the report, a provision was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, so as to enable similar actuarial reviews to be carried out every five years. These reviews will play a key role in monitoring future growth in the elderly population and the associated pension funding implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of the actuarial review fed directly into the national pensions policy initiative which was sponsored by my Department in conjunction with the Pensions Board. Securing Retirement Income, the report of the Pensions Board relating to the Initiative was published in May 1998. The report examines various strategies to expand provision for retirement income generally and includes a number of major recommendations regarding social welfare pensions. This included a <Col N="1000" /> recommendation that steps should now be taken to establish an explicit mechanism to fund, at least partially, the prospective substantial growth projected in social welfare old age pensions. I welcomed the report and indicated on behalf of the Government that the board's proposal in relation to part pre-funding of pensions deserved full examination.</P>
    <P>A working group comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments and the Pensions Board was established in July 1998 to carry out this examination and it is expected that the group will report its findings next April. The recommendations of this group will inform future consideration of social welfare pension funding, including the long-term viability of such funding and the role of the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is a very important time for pensions policy. We need to look comprehensively and very carefully over a relatively short time frame at the present position. We then need to make decisions and, most importantly, to carry these decisions through so that we address and deal with the medium to long-term issues. I am fully committed to the enhancement and development of the social insurance fund so as to ensure that the living standards of future generations of pensioners will be protected.</P>
    <P>The national pensions policy initiative, the actuarial review and the setting up of the working group to examine pre-funding of pensions are important steps towards achieving that aim.</P>

      <P>The issue of family income supplement, FIS, payments being assessed by some local authorities as income for the purposes of determining liability for local authority differential rent payments is addressed in the report, which recommends that this practice be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised this matter directly with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The position is, as the Deputy will be aware, that each local authority has responsibility for setting its own differential rents scheme, subject only to broad guidelines laid down by the Department of the Environment <Col N="1001" /> and Local Government. The Deputy will also be aware that the question of excluding any type of income from rent assessment would have to have regard to the implications for local responsibility and its financial effects on authorities, including their capacity to carry out proper management and maintenance of their dwellings.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the call made by the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Declan Costello, for a constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>Concern for the rights of the underprivileged, and a commitment to tackling the problems they have to face, are already a major part of Government policy. In the Government programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government has pledged itself to achieving a socially inclusive society. In addition, the Government is fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations and targets of the national anti-poverty strategy. This strategy recognises that poverty and disadvantage experienced by the underprivileged is multi-dimensional and requires solutions that transcend sectoral Departmental responses. The strategy has also set out clear targets to address problems in the five key areas of educational disadvantage, unemployment, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Government has introduced a system of poverty proofing across Government Departments to ensure that, for the first time, the rights and difficulties of the poor and socially excluded are considered during the formation of significant policy proposals.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the last two budgets, this Government has allocated significant funds to a range of social inclusion measures, way beyond that required by Partnership 2000 commitments, and has initiated a wide range of programmes aimed at improving the position of the disadvantaged. This Government will continue on this path of seeking a more inclusive society where all individuals can aim to reach their potential and where barriers to such achievement are ultimately removed.</P>

Work on modifying these computer systems to cater for the euro has begun. The question of supplying information on the euro value of payments to individuals will be addressed in this context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the 1999 budget provided for the introduction of a new social assistance scheme designed to provide enhanced income support to farmers on low incomes. Details of the scheme, which will be known as farm assist, will be contained in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>On a wider level, the national anti-poverty strategy NAPS, which has an overall target of reducing the numbers in consistent poverty from 9 per cent to 15 per cent of the population in 1994 to less than 5 per cent to 10 per cent by 2007, recognises the distinct characteristics of rural poverty, compounded as they are by aspects of physical isolation and demographic dependence.</P>
      <P>The NAPS aims to ensure that strategies are developed with regard to the provision of services in rural areas, especially those concerned with educational disadvantage, unemployment and income adequacy so that the overall targets are achieved in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the Task Force on Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems as well as the forthcoming White Paper on Rural Development will be vital components in the achievement of this goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention finally that in the context of the immediate needs of farmers affected by the very adverse weather in recent  months, the Deputy may be aware that my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food, are engaged in urgent discussions aimed at devising appropriate measures to assist farmers who <Col N="1004" /> are experiencing difficulties due to scarcity of winter fodder.</P>

      <Quest>if he will establish a study group to examine the problem of unemployed youths under 18 years where families, often in very deprived circumstances, receive no special allowances for such children and where the young people are ineligible for unemployment assistance and many courses.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the seriousness of the problem identified by the Deputy, I would have to be convinced of the merits of establishing a study group along the lines proposed. I am sure he will share my view that the needs of the unemployed youths aged under 18 can best be met through retention in the education system and/or through appropriate training.</P>
      <P>These issues are primarily the concerns of my colleagues, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment respectively. I know that the issues are being pursued actively through, for instance a range of actions to encourage retention within the school system; the provision of training options within the FÁS system; and access to the Youthreach programme for early school leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the welfare system seeks to support and encourage retention within the school system. For instance, child benefit is payable in respect of all children aged up to 16, and up to the age of 19 where children are in full-time education. Similarly, child dependant allowances are payable in <Col N="1005" /> respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of child poverty has always been a concern of this Government and successive budget measures, along with targeted policy initiatives, have sought to ensure that our children are protected and are given the opportunities to break an inter-generational cycle of poverty.</P>
      <P>Child income support policy plays a major role in reducing and preventing child poverty and there is widespread agreement &ndash; the Combat Poverty Agency included &ndash; that child benefit is an effective mechanism in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
      <P>In the recent budget, child benefit was increased by £3 per month for each of the first two children and by £4 per month for the third and all subsequent children. Some 513,000 families with a total of 1.2 million children will benefit from these increases. The full year cost of these increases is £40.76 million.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement &ndash; or FIS &ndash; is designed to provide income support for low wage employees with children. The payment is also available to single parents. The 1998 budget provided for the calculation of FIS on a net income rather than a gross income basis which significantly increased the supplements payable under the scheme. In addition, from June 1999, the weekly income thresholds for FIS will be increased by £8 which will result in a gain of £4.80 per week for many of the 13,000 families on FIS.</P>
      <P>Research has shown repeatedly that unemployment is a key factor in producing poor households, and this is, of course, also true for households containing children. Unemployment has fallen substantially in recent years, estimated at 7.7 per cent on average for 1998, demonstrating the significant progress already made towards the National Anti-Poverty Strategy's target rate of 6 per cent by 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national anti-poverty strategy, a system of poverty proofing has also been introduced on a one-year pilot basis across Government Departments. This system ensures that the needs of the poor and socially excluded are considered as policy is being designed. Children, particularly those living in large families, are identified as one of the groups at particular risk of poverty and, as <Col N="1006" /> such, are given particular attention in this process.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency provides advice to me and my Department in relation to a range of issues concerning poverty. Its views and recommendations are always given full consideration and form an important input into the budgetary process, subject to resource constraints and competing demands. In the context of an overall social welfare package of £273 million, it was not possible to accommodate all of the Combat Poverty Agency's recommendations. The agency's proposed increases for child benefit alone totalled some £200 million as well as recommending general social welfare rates increases of some £265 million and various other measures.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the area of child income support will continue to be a primary issue in future years and the needs of those most disadvantaged will be a priority. The advice of the Combat Poverty Agency will continue to play an important role in informing the policy framework in this regard as will relevant research from the Economic and Social Research Institute and others. In this regard, the deputy may wish to note that the ESRI will publish, around Easter of this year, a report of trends in poverty from 1994 to 1997 as an update to the 1994 Living in Ireland survey which underpinned the national anti-poverty strategy. This report will allow us to examine the ongoing trends in relation to NAPS and poverty in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the introduction of the community employment, CE, scheme in April 1994, the Social Welfare (Family Income Supplement) (Amendment) Regulations, 1994, (S.I. No. 241 of 1994) excluded CE scheme workers from being regarded as being engaged in remunerative full-time employment for FIS purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of class A PRSI to CE workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, was introduced in response to representations made by representative organisations, including the Scheme Workers' Alliance and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed. The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers by puttting them on a par with other class A workers in so far as their social insurance entitlements are concerned. The key purpose of the CE scheme is to provide part-time employment <Col N="1007" /> opportunities to the long-term unemployed with a view to their re-integration into the labour market and to improve their capacity to secure employment in the open economy. The purpose of the FIS scheme, on the other hand, is to provide income support for employees with children and on low earnings and thereby preserve the incentive to take up and remain in employment in the open economy.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, therefore, that FIS is an appropriate mechanism for improving the income position of CE workers. I might point out finally that the level of allowance payable to these workers is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced in 1993 to encourage long-term unemployed people to leave the live register to take up employment or self-employment opportunities. Over 44,000 people have availed of the scheme since its introduction. A dedicated employment support service was also established to promote the scheme and provide other supports for unemployed people in taking up employment, training or educational opportunities. The range of supports which job facilitators could provide has expanded over the years. My Department currently has 30 jobs facilitators operating at local level throughout the country. In addition there are ten co-ordinators at regional level to whom the job facilitators report and a central support unit for the employment support service generally.</P>
      <P>Advice and expertise in relation to the business start-up marketing, book-keeping, etc., is also available from organisations such as FÁS, the local employment service and the area-based partnership companies. Job facilitators work closely with these organisations in arranging training and other opportunities for unemployed people and also with professional companies which specialise in relevant training in that area.</P>
      <P>The work of the job facilitators, together with the efforts made by my Department's local office and investigative staff has, in my view, contributed significantly to the major reduction in the live register which has been achieved in recent times. It is my intention that these efforts will be intensified and that a pro-active approach aimed at helping unemployed people back into employment, training, education etc., will continue to be a central feature of the Department's service to clients. Improved co-operation with other agencies, such as FÁS, will be an important feature of this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale and nature of the resources necessary to provide the necessary supports and services to <Col N="1008" /> unemployed people is kept under review by my Department in the context of managing in the most effective and efficient manner the resources available to the Department generally. I am satisfied that the resources are being applied in an effective way.</P>

      <P>My Department has no formal operational responsibilities in regard to the Government's policy on children or the family. Matters relating to children and the family are, however, considered by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, which I chair. The committee's brief is to tackle social exclusion in an integrated way in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. My Department also has responsibility for monitoring the delivery of commitments under Partnership 2000, including commitments in the area of children and families. In that context the Department is represented on a number of groups which focus on relevant aspects of policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Community employment is an active labour market programme designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other means tested social welfare payments. Widows in receipt of survivors' contributory pension can opt for a social assistance payment such as one parent family payment or unemployment assistance on the basis of which, as jobseekers, they could establish eligibility to participate in community employment. The balance of advantage, however, usually lies with retention of the widow's pension. Widowed persons who wish to re-enter the labour force can apply to FÁS for an appropriate training course. A wide array of courses are available, including return to work courses which are specifically designed for persons who want to return to paid work after time spent working in the home.</P>
      <P>The recent review of community employment by Deloitte &amp; Touche did not make any recommendations regarding expansion of eligibility to participate in the programme. However, a Partnership 2000 working group, composed of all the social partners and chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is considering access by women to labour market opportunities. I have requested that access by widows to training and to jobs should be one of the issues considered by that group.</P>

I should add that enterprise boards are prohibited from borrowing by virtue of section 10(5)(<i>b</i>) of the Industrial Development Act, 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the enactment of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998 by the Oireachtas, Enterprise Ireland was established by Order on 23 July 1998. Under the Act certain powers are conferred on me as Minister, some of which require the concurrence of the Minister for Finance. These powers include the appointment of the board of directors, excluding the chief executive officer, the remuneration, if any, and the conditions attaching to these appointments, the terms and conditions of the staff of the agency, the <Col N="1020" /> removal of the board of directors, the issuing of policy directives and the payment of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to the agency. The Act also imposes a responsibility on me, to have, <i>inter alia,</i> laid before each House of the Oireachtas, in accordance with the legislation, the annual report and accounts of the agency.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I have responsibility for developing policy for the indigenous sector. That policy is in place and is implemented by Enterprise Ireland through a wide range of financial and other supports to promote enterprise, trade and development. These supports which include employment, marketing, technology and training grants and the provision of equity, help its client companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to profitable sales, exports and employment. The execution of policy and the provision of supports is a day to day statutory function for the agency.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has taken place since the agency was established as follows: a new three year business plan was agreed by the board in December 1998; new decision making structures for the agency's funding programmes have been established and are operational; the top level management team has been appointed and the new top level organisation structures have been put in place. I am pleased to say that 1998 was another good year for Irish owned business with sales up 10 per cent to almost £19 billion, exports up 12 per cent to £8.1 billion and over 12,500 new jobs created.</P>

      <P>The task force has been focusing on the twin tasks of finding replacement industry and undertaking a skills assessment of the redundant workers. Since the task force was established, five separate site visits have been made to the Tarkett factory by potential investors. One of these companies has expressed an interest in the facility, and IDA Ireland is aggressively pursuing this option. In the meantime, however, IDA continues to market the facility to other interested parties. FÁS has compiled a skills profile of the Tarkett workers and has identified their interests and aspirations. Some 16 people have registered for existing courses and further specialised courses are being <Col N="1021" /> developed. Thirty three people have found alternative employment.</P>

      <P>The boundaries of the seven fisheries regions, and the resultant areas of responsibility of the seven regional fisheries boards, were established by reference to the waters, river catchments and river systems deemed most appropriate to be managed on an integral basis. As is the case in County Cavan, fisheries regions of necessity often cross county lines as a result of the river systems catchment based approach. The strategic approach is to ensure effective and efficient co-operation and co-ordination between regional fisheries boards having complementary responsibilities within counties, on conservation, protection and development strategies for fisheries in a given area. In light of the Deputy's concern I am requesting the central fisheries board to pursue with the three regional fisheries boards concerned the scope if any to enhance existing co-operation in the County Cavan area.</P>

      <P>An outbreak of the viral disease ISA occurred in Scotland in spring 1998. We have been assured by the Scottish Office that EU regulations on the placing on the market of aquaculture animals in the event of an outbreak of this kind are being enforced and every effort made to prevent the spread of ISA from affected areas. There is, however, no room for complacency and we are working with the Irish salmon industry to ensure against any spread of ISA to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department, BIM and the Irish salmon industry also visited Scotland in autumn 1998 to learn at first hand from Scottish officials and the industry the details of the outbreak in Scotland and to confirm the specific measures taken in Scotland to combat and prevent the spread of ISA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IFA fish farming section has developed a code of practice in co-operation with BIM and the Department for the sector as well as for fishermen, vets and fish processors. The processing sector has also been fully alerted to the risk posed by ISA. The code of practice details specific precautionary measures to be observed by the indus<Col N="1030" /> try aimed at preventing the importation of ISA to this country.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of ISA in Scotland is also being monitored and assessed at EU level by a committee of EU Government experts. My Department is represented on that committee which is also considering further actions to prevent or deal with ISA outbreaks within the EU.</P>
    <P>My Department, BIM and the Irish salmon industry are maintaining close contact with Scottish officials and the Scottish industry to ensure full exchange of information on developments there. The situation is being kept under close review and the need for additional preventive measures will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland, RECI, has made representations to me regarding the current system of self-regulation of the electrical contracting industry and, has advocated, among other matters, the introduction of a statutory based regulatory regime covering all electrical installations. At present the ESB sets the criteria for recognition of self-regulatory bodies. I understand from the board that these criteria are in strict compliance with the provisions of competition law. Two such bodies exist &ndash; RECI was established in 1991 and a further body, the Electrical Contractors Safety <Col N="1038" /> and Standards Association, ECSSA, was formed subsequently.</P>
      <P>I have no statutory role in relation to the regulation of the electrical contracting industry. One statutory body having a role at present in relation to this area is the Health and Safety Authority. However its role relates primarily to non-domestic installations. My Department has intitiated discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment concerning a possible supervisory role for the Health and Safety Authority in relation to electrical installations generally.</P>
      <P>At present the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is considering its approach in relation to this matter. Following on from this consultation, consideration will be given to what measures may be necessary.</P>

This represents 62.75 LUs when the milk quota of 63,505 is divided by the average yield of 1,012 gallons. He also applied for 39 animals under the special beef premium scheme. As all the 39 animals are under two years they represent 0.6 LUs each, amounting to 23.4 LUs. On his 1997 area aid application he declared 57.89 hectares. The total LUs of 86.15, divided by 57.89 hectares, give a total of 1.48 livestock units per hectare. As the total livestock units are not less than 1.4 LUs per hectare, the person named is not eligible for the 1997 extensification premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>At meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers since last March when the detailed proposals for CAP reform were presented by the EU Commission, I have made it clear that the Irish Government cannot accept the proposals in their present form as they would seriously damage Irish agriculture and the Irish economy. Since the commencement of the negotiations I have obtained acknowledgment of the importance of beef and milk to Ireland by having written into the conclusions of the Agriculture Council in May last a statement that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account in the final agreement.</P>
      <P>I have put Ireland's case forcefully in bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and with ministerial colleagues. Bilateral discussions have also taken place at official level. In addition, I will be having further bilateral meetings with the Commissioner and with the German Minister, who is now President of the Council, over the coming weeks. It is my objective in these negotiations to secure a final agreement which will provide a favourable framework within which the Irish agriculture and food industries can continue to develop for the benefit of those engaged in those industries and for the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next round of trade negotiations under the auspices of the WTO is not due to commence until the end of this year. The EU will participate in that round as a single entity. One of the objectives of the Commission in formulating its CAP reform proposals was to prepare for that round of negotiations. The detailed negotiating position <Col N="1043" /> of the EU will be determined after the final outcome of CAP reform is known and Ireland will participate fully in that process.</P>

      <Quest>if he will intervene on behalf of persons (details supplied) in County Sligo in relation to the early retirement scheme in view of the fact that the owner had no choice but to resume farming as the tenant did not comply with the terms of the lease; if he will rescind the decision and waive the back payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming an applicant must cease all commercial farming activity definitively from the date the transfer documents are signed. In this case, as the persons involved recommenced farming, the pension was suspended on 30 June 1995. As the applicants have not found a farming transferee since that date and have continued farming the question of repayment of pension payments has to be considered. In this context my Department recently wrote to the persons concerned and is awaiting their views on the matter before proceeding further.</P>

      <P>The rate of pension paid to participants in the early retirement scheme was designated in ECUs up to the end of December 1998 and since that date in euros. The amount of pension payable in euros is converted to punts at the rate which was set at 1 January 1999 and this is 5.055 per cent lower than the rate at which ECUs were converted to punts for the pension scheme. As a result, pensions under the scheme have been reduced by 5.055 per cent from 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Full compensation will be payable in 1999 for the reduction in 1999 pensions to participants who joined the scheme prior to 1998. My Department is in consultation with the EU Commission for clarification on the issue of compensation for participants who joined during 1998. Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid.</P>

Penalties imposed are generally deducted from the next payment due to the applicant.</P>
      <P>The EU funds 75 per cent of the expenditure under the REP scheme. Member states are required under the terms of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No. 729/70 to satisfy themselves that transactions financed by the EU are carried out and are executed correctly and to recover penalties imposed in cases of non-compliance. Sums recovered are credited to the appropriate EU account and my Department's vote in proportion to the rate of funding received i.e. 75 per cent to the EU and 25 per cent to my Department.</P>

The person concerned did not use any of his suckler cow quota in 1997 and did not reply to a letter issued by the quota section on 2 February 1998 regarding the non-usage of quota. Therefore, his suckler cow quota has been forfeited to the national reserve and is not available to him for 1998. As he holds no suckler cow quota he has no entitlement to suckler cow premium and his application for the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme can not be processed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to be paid cattle headage amounting to over £500 a herdowner must submit his RSI number. The local district livestock office wrote to the person named on 8 September 1998 requesting his RSI number. No reply has been received to date and his application under the <Col N="1058" /> cattle headage scheme is still outstanding pending same.</P>

These promotions emphasised the overall qualify of all mountain lamb, and were held in response to market conditions and changes in the structure of export markets. The objective was to increase the profile of the product by emphasising its unique and different taste. Promotions in Spain were undertaken with a major retailer, while the Irish promotional activities were conducted with fifty selected restaurants through the chefs guild, Eurotoques.</P>
      <P>In terms of export potential, it should be noted that there was substantial progress in export markets for hill lambs up to 1996, but since then, there has been evidence of structural change in target markets. Bord Bia continues to monitor the situation very closely to ensure that every opportunity is availed of to promote and maximise the sale of this product. Appropriate promotional activities continue to be a feature of Bord Bia's programme and are included in its 1999 programme.</P>

A certificate of tax free allowances granting the taxpayer the appropriate personal allowances for the 1998/99 tax year was issued to her on 8 January, 1999.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the VAT threshold for service businesses in Ireland is less than half that operating in the United Kingdom; his views on whether the current £20,000 threshold is so low it would not even generate a weekly wage for one person; and if he will modify the threshold.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ireland the services registration threshold is <Col N="1069" /> £20,000 while the goods registration threshold is £40,000. Taxable persons are required to register and account for VAT if turnover exceeds these amounts in any twelve month period. In the UK the registration threshold is UK £50,000 for both goods and services. Apart from the UK, which has the highest VAT registration thresholds in the EU, Ireland's VAT thresholds are high relative to other member states as some require all businesses irrespective of size to register for VAT.</P>
      <P>A higher services registration threshold would contribute to a distortion of competition for those businesses trading close to the level at which registration is required, since those immediately above it are required to register and pay VAT on their entire turnover, while those below it need not. Since the significant cost to service businesses is direct labour costs, and since such costs do not bear VAT, the financial advantage would favour the business below the threshold.</P>
      <P>A higher services registration threshold also allows for increased risk of avoidance since it makes it easier for a business to avoid registration and the line between an unregistered business and the black economy becomes difficult to identify. A higher threshold also has implications for the Exchequer in terms of reduced VAT revenue.</P>
      <P>The current services VAT registration threshold of £20,000 excludes genuinely small service businesses while preventing tax based competition and maintaining an important Exchequer contribution. I am not, therefore, inclined to make any changes to the VAT registration thresholds and I am satisfied that the current levels are appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic services in the health boards are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The dental health action plan provides for the development of a consultant led service by each health board. A consultant led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic services in the Western Health Board area and the maintenance of waiting lists are the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I understand from the board that the board's orthodontic waiting lists increased for a period during which time the board was without the services of a consultant orthodontist following the resignation of the previous consultant on her appointment to a post in the Eastern Health Board. The post of consultant orthodontist was filled by the board in July 1997. <Col N="1071" /> The board is satisfied that waiting lists are being tackled and the situation has improved.</P>
    <P>The  board has advised me that in respect of urgent or priority cases, no delay whatsoever is occasioned and treatment is provided immediately. In other cases which fall within the framework of the approved eligibility criteria for provision of service, the delay does not in any way impact on a successful clinical outcome to treatment.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>
    <P>I understand that this group has recently made its report to the chief executive officers of the health boards and it is now under consideration by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 232 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended to meet the full costs involved. It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £9 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors, namely, the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £33 million. Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on budgetary circumstances and competing priorities at the time.</P>
      <P>When the Deputy refers to a grade four rate of subvention, it is assumed he is referring to the provision whereby health boards may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency. I am aware that most of the health boards pay enhanced rates of subvention in particular cases. I am satisfied that a sympathetic view is taken of cases where personal funds are exhausted, by increasing the level of subvention where possible. Where this does not solve the problem, a health board will try to provide accommodation in one of their own long stay hospitals or nursing units.</P>
      <P>One of the changes made to the subvention scheme operation under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act since its implementation permits health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes above the number contracted on 1 September, 1993, and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. This amendment is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need. In 1999, the full year costs of contracting an additional 65 nursing home beds is being allocated to the Eastern Health Board, which will help to alleviate the pressure on acute hospital beds in the major general hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The placement of a resident in private nursing homes is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Health boards are not privy to such arrangements and would not be aware of the numbers of people in <Col N="1073" /> private nursing homes who are being charged a reduced rate of fee by the owners.</P>

    <P>Regarding average waiting times and length of time on the cardiac surgery list for patients, the Deputy may wish to know that, on foot of the recommendations of the waiting list initiative review group report, agencies are in the process of validating their waiting lists in line with the policy circular and guidelines issued by my Department on 7 January 1999. I will revert to the Deputy at the earliest opportunity with this information which should provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the situation regarding waiting times for cardiac surgery.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in 1998, I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list  initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting &ndash; adults and children &ndash; at the end of September 1998 by 349. This represents a reduction of 22 per cent on the figure for September 1997.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

    <P>I have recently provided approximately £3 million in additional resources to health boards to bring the minimum rate of payment for all home helps up to £3 per hour from 1 April 1999.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the patient to whom the Deputy is referring was admitted to St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar on 27 November 1998 for radiotherapy treatment. The patient subsequently requested that he receive his treatment as an out-patient and was discharged on 7 December. Accordingly, the hospital continued to treat the patient on an out-patient basis until 29 December.</P>
      <P>I understand that the patient became ill on that date and was immediately re-admitted to St. Luke's as an in-patient. His condition was assessed and it was decided that he required immediate neurological assessment at Beaumont Hospital. The patient was immediately referred to Beaumont Hospital and was admitted as an in-patient. Following treatment at Beaumont, radiotherapy treatment was re-commenced at St. Luke's on an out-patient basis on 14 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Luke's experienced a significant increase in emergency referrals in early January. In the circumstances, it was not possible to immediately re-admit the patient as an in-patient and he remained as an in-patient at Beaumont. The patient was brought from Beaumont to St. Luke's for continuing radiotherapy treatment on an out-<Col N="1078" /> patient basis and was subsequently transferred to St. Luke's as an in-patient on 25 January.</P>
    <P>It is regular practice for patients who have received treatment at Beaumont Hospital to be referred to St. Luke's Hospital for radiotherapy. In some cases the patients are admitted to St. Luke's for their treatment but in other cases the patients are brought to St. Luke's for their treatment and then back to Beaumont, as they are still under the care of a Beaumont Hospital consultant. I understand that this is the position with the patient concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand that the hospital is at present actively exploring the feasibility of extending the Oakland Lodge facility at the hospital with funding provided by the Friends of St. Luke's which will see the provision of a further 10 bed spaces. The hospital authorities anticipate that this expansion will proceed this year. I am confident this further development will impact favourably on the provision of services at St. Luke's.</P>

      <P>Since the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 came into operation on 21 April 1998, the Department of Health and Children has received 188 requests for access to records, 144 during 1998 and a further 44 during January 1999.</P>
      <P>The Department has issued decisions on 150 requests: refusing access in 57 cases and granting partial access in 32 others. The Department has received 24 applications for internal review and issued decisions on 18 of these, releasing additional information in three cases.</P>
      <P>There have been six appeals to the Information Commissioner. In one case the commissioner confirmed the records concerned were exempt, in another the Department was in a position to release the record which was no longer sensitive. The remainder are still under consideration.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> Section 47 requires public bodies to charge fees for search and retrieval of records but it is normally possible, in consultation with the requester, to narrow the focus of the request and minimise or eliminate the appropriate fee.</P>
    <P>Payments were sought on three other occasions from corporate/journalism requesters: one of these was appealed and revised. Of the 14 requests received from members of Dáil Éireann, such payments were sought on two occasions.  A review of one of these was sought and refused.

      <P>To this end, I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include: the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists &ndash; this represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million to services for older people &ndash; this will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services &ndash; this will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
      <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator/bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined under the waiting list initiative will help to reduce waiting times and free up appropriate facilities for patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing drugs cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes. The new scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>From the introduction of the new scheme no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month.</P>
      <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example, in one month have expenditure of £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
      <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion on the new drug payment scheme. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old DCSS scheme, where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold, there has been no increase in the threshold for the existing schemes since 1991. It must also be borne in mind that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the existing threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme which relates to individual expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended <Col N="1083" /> since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by it, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes, which will now be improved by the drug payment scheme.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &ndash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &ndash; due to a long-term medical condition such as Crohn's disease, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from illnesses such as Crohn's disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Cardiac surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at four centres. Adult cardiac surgery is performed at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, St. James's Hospital and Cork University Hospital. Paediatric cardiac surgery is performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. At the end of September 1998, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1,237 patients awaiting cardiac surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other waiting list information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by the relevant agencies and furnished to my Department. However, I have had inquiries made of these agencies and I understand that there were 1,993 cardiac surgery procedures carried out between 1 January 1997 and 30 September 1998. I further understand that at three of the cardiac centres there are 474 patients in total on the waiting list for more than two years and 361 patients in total on the waiting list for more than three years. The authorities at St. James's Hospital have advised <Col N="1084" /> me that they have 241 patients on the waiting list for more than one year. However, they state that they are currently unable to provide a breakdown of patients who are waiting more than two years and more than three years.</P>
    <P>There are currently five cardiac surgeons in Dublin and two in Cork holding full public service contracts. The common contract commitment relates to a 33 hour week. However, interviews have recently taken place for the appointment of an additional cardiac surgeon at St. James's Hospital and I understand that an appointment will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>I understand that the average waiting time patients may expect to wait from time of joining the waiting list to having their surgery carried out is between 2 and 2.5 years. However, this depends on the clinical assessment of the consultant.</P>
    <P>In 1998 I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. Despite the difficulties at the Mater Hospital in recent months, referred to above, the impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting, adults and children, at the end of September 1998 by 349. This represents a reduction of 22 per cent on the figure for September 1997.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy relating to children is set out in the Programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium. In my response to the Deputy's question I will set out the issues relevant to my responsibilities in the Department of Health and Children which arise in the context of the implementation of this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the implementation of the Kilkenny incest report, the Kelly Fitzgerald report and the Madonna House report, it should be noted that most of the recommendations fall to health boards to implement and boards continue to be resourced to meet their responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991. Since 1993 and to end 1998, £50.5 million has been made available, on an annualised basis, to support the <Col N="1086" /> implementation of the Act and a further £13 million will be made available in 1999.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the White Paper on mandatory reporting has begun and the working group to review the child abuse guidelines, which is due to report shortly, is also feeding into this process. Community care child protection services are reviewed annually in the context of service plans submitted by the boards. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has been asked to consider a constitutional amendment to underpin the individual rights of children: the views of the committee are not yet to hand.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991 is now fully implemented and, as I mentioned earlier, resources continue to be made available to support the further development of services. In regard to the regulation of child care and crèche facilities, under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification, the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and will arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. All pre-school services should be inspected by mid 1999 and inspections will take place annually thereafter.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the development of a modern legislative framework to reflect contemporary adoption practice. Work has commenced on a Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and on legislation to provide for post-adoption contact.</P>
    <P>In regard to policy on the family, the resources made available to boards, as set out above, have allowed them to develop and improve family support services, in addition to the improvements which have also taken place in the child protection area and, as the Deputy will be aware, I am committed to ensuring the success of the family support projects established under the springboard initiative, the main purpose of which is to prevent at risk children and young people from engaging in various forms of anti-social behaviour by providing a proactive response to these children and their families. A total of £7.2 million has been made available to support these projects.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government is committed to the introduction of a national children's strategy and work is under way on this. Due to the importance of the national strategy, I intend to have a wide consultative process before final proposals are agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>Advances in vehicle emission control technology have resulted in significant pollution reductions from individual motor vehicles since the first EU directive on vehicle emission control standards was adopted in 1970. Since then, progressively more stringent standards have been set and the implementation of the 1998 EU Auto Oil 1 Programme will require further emission reductions from the years 2000 and 2005.</P>
      <P>Isolating the impact of changes in vehicle emission control technologies over a period of time from the effects of other changes, for example, in vehicle size, vehicle characteristics or use characteristics, has not, to my Department's knowledge, been undertaken in Ireland. However, overall growth in the transport sector, measured by vehicle fleet size and kilometres travelled, is counterbalancing technological improvements in individual vehicle standards which would otherwise have the effect of reducing emissions.</P>

      <P>I understand from Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council that the section of the Southern Cross Route to Ballinteer Road is due to be completed in Spring 2001, the Ballinteer Road-Wyckham by-pass scheme, which is being funded by the National Roads Authority, is due to go to tender on 1 March 1999. Work is expected to commence on 1 August 1999 and be completed in November 2000.</P>
      <P>The Wyckham bypass section of the Ballinteer Road-Wyckham bypass scheme must be completed before work can commence on the Dundrum bypass. I understand that work on the Wyckham bypass section will be completed in sufficient time to allow the Dundrum bypass go to tender on 1 October 1999 and that work should commence on 1 March 2000. With an estimated contract period of 15 months the project would be due for completion in June 2001.</P>

Many of the programmes administered by my Department, which are relevant to the general public, impact on the family, including children. However, there are no programmes for which my Department is responsible which are specifically or solely directed at the family or children.</P>

      <P>This scheme was included as part of the preliminary report for the Ballina regional water supply scheme submitted to my Department in the 1970s but was not approved for further advancement at that time. The preliminary report costings are now out of date and as the scheme is not included in the 1999 Water and Sewerage Services Investment Programme it comes within the terms of my Department's Circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The suggestion has been made from time to time that there should be exemptions from the licence fee for certain categories of dog owner, such as old age pensioners. The dog licence fee, which amounts to less than 20p per week, constitutes a small part of the overall cost of keeping a dog and should not be an undue burden to dog owners. In addition, an exemption scheme would be potentially difficult and expensive to administer, this would be likely to outweigh the benefits arising from it. In the circumstances I do not propose to introduce such a scheme.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement, FIS, scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment. As provided for in section 200 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, once the level of a claimant's FIS entitlement is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks provided that the claimant remains in employment. The only circumstances in which the rate of payment can be amended is where an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>This provision forms an integral part of the FIS scheme and is included specifically to ensure that claimants can have absolute certainty that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period. This certainty is critical to the success of the scheme in providing a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities. It is recognised that, as a consequence, there is no provision to adjust the level of FIS payable upwards to compensate for any reduction in income that may occur in the course of the 52 week period. Equally, however, where the earnings of a FIS claimant rise in the course of that period, there is no provision either to reduce the amount of FIS payable.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am not of the view that an amendment to the legislation along the lines proposed by the Deputy would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>Pay related social insurance contributions are made by employers, employees and the self employed. The rate of PRSI contribution depends on the class of social insurance applicable which, in turn, determines the range of benefits and pensions to which contributors may, in due course, become entitled.</P>
      <P>The majority of PRSI contributors are in the industrial, commercial and services sectors. Employees in these sectors are covered by Class A social insurance and the combined employer and employee rate of PRSI is either 13 per cent of 16.5 per cent depending on the level of weekly income. The employee contributors build up entitlement over time to the full range of benefits and pensions provided under the system, including invalidity pension and all other contributory pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contributors who pay PRSI at Class D are permanent and pensionable public servants, not including civil servants, who were recruited prior to 6 April 1995. These contributors are covered for widow's/widower's contributory pensions, occupational injuries benefits and orphan's con<Col N="1099" /> tributory allowance only. The range of cover provided by Class D PRSI is reflected in the combined rate of employer and employee contribution payable which is 3.25 per cent in total.</P>
    <P>Any extension of Class D cover to include the full range of benefits or individual benefits such as invalidity pension would require an increase in the contribution rates payable by both the employer and the employee. It is not proposed, at this stage, to extend the range of benefits provided by Class D cover. However, it should be noted that all employees recruited to the civil and public service subsequent to 5 April, 1995, pay PRSI at Class A and are therefore covered for the full range of social insurance benefits.</P>

      <P>Both the self-employed and employees can qualify for a standard old age &ndash; contributory &ndash; pension, if they satisfy the qualifying conditions, namely that they entered social insurance before reaching the age of 56; have 156 full employment contributions paid; have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions paid and-or credited from 1953 to the end of the tax year prior to reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>Where a person fails to satisfy the yearly average qualifying condition, s/he may qualify for a <i>pro rata </i>old age contributory pension, introduced in November 1997, if the yearly average is between ten and 19 and at least 260 contributions have been paid in total.</P>
      <P>Where a person fails to satisfy the qualifying conditions at 2 and 3 above, she/he may qualify for a mixed insurance <i>pro-rata </i>pension if a mixture of full rate and modified rate social insurance contributions has been paid. I have announced the introduction of special old age contributory pension for those self-employed who were 56 years of age or over when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988, and as a result could not satisfy the first qualifying condition set out above. Title to this pension will be created from April next and payment will commence from October. This pension will be payable to those self-employed who were aged 56 or over when they entered social insurance in April 1988 and who have at least 5 years contributions paid since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that pension provision of the self-employed as outlined is adequate and I have no plans to make any further changes in this area at present. However, my Department will shortly be undertaking a general review of the qualifying conditions for receipt of both retirement and old <Col N="1100" /> age contributory pensions and I will report to the House on the outcome of that review in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the PRSI scheme for share fishermen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the High Court judgment in the Griffith case in 1992, share fishermen were regarded as self-employed contributors for the purpose of social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>To assist share fishermen who suffered a reduction is social insurance cover following the change in their PRSI status, an optional scheme of social insurance &ndash; Class P &ndash; was introduced in 1994. This scheme gives share fishermen the option, on the payment of an additional contribution, of enhancing their social insurance cover over and above that available to other self-employed persons. Payment of the additional contribution provides limited cover for disability benefit and unemployment benefit as well as full cover for treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Department reviewed the social insurance arrangements of share fishermen in the light of representations and consultations with fishermen and their families. As a result revised arrangements for share fishermen were announced by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements provide that share fishermen who are employed under a contract of service i.e. where an employer/employee relationship exists, are fully insured for PRSI purposes and, therefore, eligible for the full range of benefits. Share fishermen who are employed on a partnership basis are insurable as self employed contributors and pay PRSI at Class S. Access to the  optional scheme continues to be available to such self employed share fishermen. My Department produced a fact sheet in 1997 which outlines the PRSI position in detail and, in particular, the factors to be taken into account when deciding if a contract of service or partnership arrangement exists.</P>
      <P>Boat owners, skippers and the people working in the industry are now at liberty to negotiate and operate their own work contracts. Whether these contracts give rise to self-employment or employment depends on the contract negotiated between the individuals concerned. Once these contracts are negotiated the social insurance position which applies is similar to that which applies to any employee or self employed person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current arrangements means that people in the share fishing industry now have the ability to arrange their work contracts in order to avail of a wide range of social insurance benefits. The level of take up of the optional scheme has been <Col N="1101" /> poor and the latest statistics indicate that there are currently only some 31 contributors.</P>
    <P>In the event of a disagreement regarding the correct PRSI position my Department investigated the nature of the contract and a deciding officer will decide the nature of the contract on the basis of the facts as presented. If any party is dissatisfied with the decision there is a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. I understand that a number of such appeals have been submitted and are due to be held shortly.</P>
    <P>Both myself and my officials continue to be in regular contact with representatives from all interested parties in the share fishing sector, including employers, employees and the self employed on this matter. It is my intention to meet with representatives of Irish South and West Fishermen's Organisation later this week.</P>
    <P>The question of reviewing the current arrangements may be considered in the future in the ongoing consultations with interested parties, further experience of the current arrangements and any new developments.</P>

He is, therefore, now entitled to pension at the minimum rate of £2.50 a week. He remains entitled, in addition, to a living alone allowance of £6 a week, and a fuel allowance of £5 a week during the winter heating season. He is also in receipt of free travel, free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance, and is entitled to a free television licence.

Details of the grants paid to voluntary and community groups in 1998 are currently being compiled and will be available in the Dáil Library in the coming weeks.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to indentify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was initially allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. I am satisfied that this level of funding was sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again last year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people have been assisted in 1998. This means that since I came into office I have spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government programme  An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a range of commitments in relation to the family and children. The primary responsibility of my Department relates to income support for families and children. The recent budget made provision for a package amounting to £305.5 million in a full year. As part of this package, £40 million provided for improvements in child benefit: family income supplement was improved by £4 million, including an increase of £8 in the weekly thresholds from June 1999 and the carers allowance was boosted by £18 million on top of the existing £45 million.</P>
      <P>My Department has significant and substantial responsibilities for the Government's social inclusion commitments, income support arrangements for families, services for lone parents, support for the community development programme and for the community and voluntary sector generally and for the development of family policy. In this context, the Department has particular responsibility fo the Government commitment to adopt a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies in the context of developing coherent progressive and effective policies for families as promised in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>In line with its pro-family approach to the development of policy and services and in response to recommendations from the Commission on the Family the Government has established a family affairs unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The functions of the family affairs unit are; to co-ordinate family policy, to pursue the findings in the report of the Commission on the Family (published July 1998) following their consideration by the Government; to undertake research; and to promote awareness about family issues.</P>
      <P>The unit has responsibility for support for the marriage counselling services and the Family Mediation Service as well as a number of other family services including a pilot programme to provide improved service to families from local offices of the Department through the one-stop-shop model, and the introduction of an information programme on parenting issues.</P>
      <P>This year £6.5 million has been allocated specifically for the development of family services. This includes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;£2.1 million for marriage and child counselling and bereavement counselling and support. It is expected that over 250 groups providing these services will receive grants this year. An allocation of £60,000 is being made this year to Rainbows programmes which provide a very special type of support <Col N="1107" /> to children who experience the loss of a parent, through death or separation.</P>
    <P>&ndash;An extra £200,000 for the continued development of the Family Mediation Service. The framework for the nation-wide service as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium is now in place. The Family Mediation Service is now providing services from regional centres in Cork, Tralee, Wexford, Athlone, Dundalk and Galway in addition to those in Dublin and Limerick. The allocation in 1999 will consolidate the services in place and allow for further expansion to other areas of the country including the north west.</P>
    <P>&ndash;An extra £1 million for the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme will allow an additional 15 to 20 centres to be initiated in 1999. By the end of this year some 50 centres will be funded under the programme, under which ten centres were being funded at the beginning of 1998. A number of these centres provide crèche facilities while parents are participating in the activities of the centre.</P>
    <P>&ndash;An allocation of £200,000 has been provided in the budget under the community development and family and community services resource centre programmes to support local initiatives for the development of out of school hours services.</P>
    <P>The out of school hours service provides opportunities to enhance support for children in disadvantaged communities who do not have many opportunities for learning and recreation and who may be unoccupied outside school hours.</P>
    <P>Resources have been allocated for the development of a number of initiatives by the Family Affairs Unit in 1999 including undertaking research, a pilot programme in relation to the local offices of the Department building on the one-stop-shop concept with the aim of providing improved support at local level to families and the introduction of an information programme on parenting issues.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions No. 282 and 287 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the administration of the disabled persons maintenance allowance disabled person's maintenance allowance transferred from the health boards to my Department on 2 October 1996 when the allowance was renamed disability allowance. At that stage a total of 34,500 persons formerly in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance became entitled to disability allowance. Continuing entitlement under this scheme is subject to the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>Ongoing reviews of disability allowance cases in respect of both medical and means eligibility are undertaken by my Department on a systematic basis. Of the 34,500 persons who were previously in receipt of disabled persons maintenance allowance in excess of 20,000 have been subjected to medical or means review. Ten persons have had their allowance withdrawn on the grounds that they no longer satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance and a further 307 had their allowances withdrawn on the grounds that they no longer satisfied the means criteria. Statistics are not available on the numbers of these who suffer from physical and sensory disability. The persons concerned were informed of the decision and the reasons for it in each case and advised of their right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons in receipt of disability allowance at present is in excess of 47,000.</P>

      <P>There is an obligation on all claimants for one-parent family payment to make, and continue to make, appropriate efforts in the particular circumstances to obtain maintenance in respect of themselves and &ndash; or their children from their former spouse or partner. This obligation reflects the general policy of the scheme that, in so far as possible, one-parent families should be maintained by their former spouses or partners rather than have to rely on social welfare support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If evidence is supplied by a lone parent to indicate that the spouse or partner concerned is violent and that there is a consequent ongoing risk to the claimant, the Department does not insist on <Col N="1109" /> further contact between the parties for the purpose of seeking maintenance.

If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will arrange to have the matter examined as soon as details are forwarded to my Department.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 289, 291 and 292 together.</P>
      <P>The legal basis for payment of a rent or mortage interest supplement to people on back to work schemes is contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and in the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations, 1995, made by the Minister in exercise of the powers conferred on him by that Act.</P>
      <P>Persons in full-time employment are generally excluded from receiving payments under the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA scheme, including rent and mortage interest supplements. However, Article 6(2) of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations, 1995, provides that a person shall not be disqualified from receiving SWA while engaged in full-time remunerative work where that person is participating in specified back to work schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in receipt of back to work allowance are the main beneficiaries. The back to work allowance scheme is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active lab<Col N="1112" /> our force. The scheme has proved to a significant success with over 24,600 persons currently participating throughout the country, some 1,200 of whom are in receipt of rent supplement and a further 300 or so are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement. Statistics for the previous years requested are not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>To be entitled to an unemployment payment a person must satisfy a deciding officer that he or she fulfils, or continues to fulfil, the statutory conditions of being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment. Where a deciding officer decides following an interview with the person, that he or she does not to fulfil the conditions, the claim is formally disallowed.</P>
      <P>The number of people whose claims were disallowed on the grounds that they failed to satisfy the statutory condition of being genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment was approximately 1,000 in 1997 and in excess of 2,000 in 1998. The corresponding figures for those regarded as &ldquo;not available&rdquo; were 5,000 and 6,500.</P>
      <P>A person has a right of appeal against a decision to disallow his or her claim for failing to satisfy any of these conditions. Where the appeal is allowed the claim is reinstated.</P>

    <P>Appeals statistics do not differentiate between the two categories of appeals. The following figures cover the number of appeals in relation to both categories for the years in question:<Col N="1113" /></P>

      <P>The whole of the Rogerstown estuary is a proposed natural heritage area and is also proposed for designation as a Special Area of Conservation, SAC. The outer estuary from Rogerstown Viaduct to the Burrow and part of the Eastern Ford is designated as a special protection area. The public advertisement of the area as a proposed candidate SAC provides legal protection for the important wildlife habitats and species to be found in the inner estuary.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is currently reviewing the situation to ascertain if the inner portion of the estuary merits additional designation as a special protection area.</P>

      <P>In relation to consultancies, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 349 of 30 June 1998. Since that date the following consultancies have been commissioned:&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.Glendalough, County Wicklow &ndash; Visitor Management Plan (East West Tourism Consultancy Ltd). 2.Study of Heritage Tourism potential at Mount Bellew, County Galway <Col N="1117" /> (C.H.L. Consulting Ltd). 3.Study of possible environmental aspects relating to Pollardstown Fen &ndash; Kildare Bypass Road (D. Ball and P. Johnston). 4.Study on Income Generation at Dúchas heritage sites and at the Cultural Institutions (C.H.L. Consulting Ltd). 5.Study on Industry Heritage (F. Hammond). 6.Archaeology and Environmental Impact (J. Carroll Archaeological Consultancy). 7.Examination of public submissions made in relation to the proposed National Heritage Plan (N. Lynch).</P>
    <P>In relation to other contracts and disbursements, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department provides grants and payments to many hundreds of individuals and bodies in any single year &ndash; particularly in the context of schemes relating to the Gaeltacht, including Gaeltacht housing grants and grants to householders providing accommodation for students attending Irish summer colleges. The detailed information sought by the Deputy would involve the examination of numerous records and would be difficult to justify in the light of the amount of official time and expense involved. If, however, the Deputy wishes to bring to my attention any particular cases he has in mind, I will, of course, be glad to assist him.</P>

      <P>While my Department does not have any direct responsibility for <Col N="1118" /> implementing the Government's policy on children and the family there are a number of measures which are taken either directly by my Department or by bodies under its aegis which relate to these policies. These measures include:&ndash;</P>
      <P>1.The encouragement of families and young people to visit the heritage sites managed by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, by providing discount admission charges to the sites. 2.The provision of educational and outreach facilities on a continuing basis by the major cultural institutions operating under the aegis of my Department. For example, the National Gallery of Ireland provides a young peoples' programme which comprises a number of initiatives aimed specifically at children and teenagers, the majority of which are free of charge e.g. the children's Christmas art holiday and some activities involve family participation as well. The annual heritage day is also marked in each of these institutions. 3.The provision of a code of standards in advertising and childrens' programmes aimed at protecting children from the effects of potentially harmful advertising. 4.The provision by the National Library of Ireland of facilities for family research.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that a range of activities aimed at the promotion of the use of Irish by young people is supported by my Department, Bord na Gaeilge and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that an application for outline planning permission was submitted on 31 December 1998 to Kerry County Council in respect of 21 holiday homes and site development works, including landscaping and sewage treatment plant, at Ventry, Dingle, County Kerry, a copy of which was subsequently forwarded by my Department.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the application, officials of Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, issued an initial recommendation that the developer should engage the services of a qualified archaeologist to carry out an assessment of the proposed development and describe its impact on the known and potential archaeology of the site. It is envisaged that a copy of this report should be submitted to the local authority and to my Department in advance of planning permission being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the natural heritage, Dúchas would not propose to object to the application as no development is to take place within <Col N="1119" /> the boundaries of the proposed natural heritage area of Ventry Dunes and Marshes. However, adequate steps will need to be taken to ensure that the disposal of sewage-effluent will have no negative impact on the ecology of the site.</P>

      <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teachta tá iarrachtaí ar bun le tamall de bhlianta chun teacht ar réiteach le húdaráis cuí na Breataine i dtaca le cumhacht an tarachuradóra ag Clermont Carn, Contae Lú, a mhéadú ar mhaithe leis an bhfáil ar RTÉ agus ar Theilifís na Gaeilge a fheabhsú i dTuaisceart na hÉireann. Go déanach anuraidh chuir trialacha ón tarachuradóir isteach ar an bhfáil ar sheirbhísí na Ríochta Aontaithe i Manainn. Tá iarrachtaí ar bun chun na deacrachtaí sin a réiteach agus táthar ag súil leis gur féidir teacht ar réiteach ar an gceist sin go luath.</P>
      <P>Mar thoradh ar na méaduithe cumhachta ag Clermont Carn in éine acht leis an bhfáil atá ann cheana féin ó tharachuradóirí eile de chuid RTÉ, táthar ag súil leis go mbeidh teacht ag 70 faoin gcéad de phobal Thuaisceart na hÉireann ar RTÉ agus ar Theilifís na Gaeilge i gcomparáid le figiúr de thart ar 30 faoin gcéad nuair a thosaigh na hiarrachtaí seo.</P>

Is ag udáráis atá lonnaithe i Londain atá na cúraimí feidhmiúla sin.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to distinguish between populations of lapwing whose numbers vary enormously according to the extent of cold-weather, related emigration from the Continent and the much smaller breeding population. A 30 per cent decrease in the breeding range of the lapwing has been recorded in the period between the early 1970s and late 1980s, along with a decline in some local populations, principally the nationally important population along the Shannon callows. Increased predation of eggs and chicks, together with agricultural intensification are factors in this decline.</P>
      <P>The designation and protection afforded by the designation of special protection areas and special areas of conservation will contribute to the maintenance of suitable habitats for wild birds including the lapwing. This, together with the environmental benefits from improved practices under the rural environmental protection scheme, will, I believe, represent a significant benefit for the protection of all our wildlife, including birds such as the lapwing.</P>

      <P>A Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet set up in my Department and consisting of representatives from both the public and private sectors, submitted their first report last July. In a detailed report which highlighted a wide range of complex technical and legal issues surrounding the problem of child pornography on the Internet, the group made a large number of recommendations including the establishment of a system of self-regulation by the service provider industry. Discussions with the industry in this regard are ongoing.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act which I introduced last year is also an essential element in ensuring that the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear on those who are involved in child pornography activities on the Internet within this jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 312, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Since taking up my appointment I have made it a priority to tackle the problem of drug abuse and addiction in the prison system. As I have said on many occasions in the past, I believe that the most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted prisoners in a combination of appropriate treatment, education and rehabilitation. Treatment for drug addicted offenders is currently available in all prisons as part of the general medical services available to all prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department now has an agreed policy on substance abuse with the Eastern Health Board. <Col N="1123" /> An action plan to implement this policy in the prison system is under consideration at present. In addition to examining the feasibility of providing a drug free area in each prison and increased detoxification facilities, it is intended to consider the development of further educational and training courses suitable for addicts.</P>
    <P>The safe and secure provision of methadone maintenance to suitable prisoners is among the issues for consideration in the drug treatment action plan. At present a small number of HIV positive prisoners receive methadone maintenance on a structured and supervised basis in Mountjoy Prison as part of their medical treatment.</P>
    <P>Development of the drug treatment programmes and the drug free areas which are necessary to facilitate long-term methadone maintenance programmes for other prisoners is greatly hampered by overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison. However, this obstacle will be removed as the prison building programme progresses. The opening this year of the new women's prison at Mountjoy, a new male remand centre at Cloverhill and a new male prison in Portlaoise will help alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling in and use of illegal drugs in the prisons. These include improved visiting and searching facilities, video surveillance, increased vigilance by staff, and urine testing. Where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates, gardaí are called to the prison and a number of persons have been successfully prosecuted. It is my intention to continue efforts to reduce the level of drug abuse in the prison system.</P>
    <P>The drug treatment unit in Mountjoy has proven to be a success. One hundred and sixty eight inmates have been admitted to this unit since it opened in July 1996. The successful completion rate of the programme during the first twelve months of operation was 98 per cent. It has been proven that prisoners who are motivated and who are given an opportunity to engage in a structured detox and rehabilitation programme and whose environment is made drug free through strict regulation of visits will successfully stay off illicit drugs. A review of the first two years of the drug treatment unit is due to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today and to the health of the individual prisoners who have the motivation to deal with their addiction. I recognise, however, that more needs to be done and, as I have indicated, I am currently examining options to improve the level of services available to drug addicted prisoners.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Prison Building Projects</i>The total of contracts for prisons building projects entered into by my Department since July 1997 to date is £46,579,033.49. The total expenditure on professional fees in respect of services rendered by my Department during the same period in relation to prison design works or specific building projects amounted to £1,086,319.12. It would not, however, be appropriate for me to break these figures down to reveal the cost of each consultancy or contract because of the market sensitive nature of this information. Furthermore, in the interests of the security of the prisons, it would not be appropriate for me to identify contractors, consultancy firms or individual consultants in particular prisons works or specific building projects.</P>

      <i>Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme</i>In July 1998, I approved funding under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, to the following organisations under the capital infrastructure initiative, the community support initiative and the employer demonstration initiative:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that crime statistics are compiled on the basis of Garda operational areas, which do not always coincide with county boundaries. For this reason, I hope the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible to give separate figures for counties Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The crime statistics for the Garda divisions of Donegal and Sligo-Leitrim for the year 1998 are set out below. These statistics may be subject to minor change as the investigation of crimes progresses.</P>

      <P>A divisional drugs unit exists in the Sligo-Leitrim Division, with particular emphasis on the Sligo town area. Gardaí from this division and other Border divisions have received specific training, and engage in activities, to combat drug supply and abuse as part of the services they provide in their respective divisions. As needs dictate, a select number of members from these divisions are drawn together to operate as a single unit on specific drugs related operations.</P>
      <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit has a national brief and is also directly concerned with the issue of drug abuse in the Border areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the cumulative effect of the structures, which I have outlined, are sufficient at this point in time to provide the level of service required to tackle the problems of drug misuse and abuse in the Border areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have also assured me that this issue remains under constant review and that the option of a dedicated Border drugs unit will be considered in the future, if it is deemed a feasible and efficient option in countering the problem of drug abuse in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three ways in <Col N="1136" /> which a person who is not a citizen of Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship: by descent (foreign births registration), by naturalisation or by marriage to an Irish citizen (postal-nuptial citizenship). Certificates of citizenship in respect of naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship (PNC) issue from my Department. The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the administration of foreign births registration.</P>
      <P>At present, applications for naturalisation can take in excess of twelve months to process while declarations in respect of post-nuptial citizenship can take up to six months to process.</P>
      <P>The decision to naturalise a person is a very serious one and of necessity the procedures involved in dealing with each application are lengthy. This has always been the case and the processing times which apply in Ireland are not longer than those in other jurisdictions about which I have information.</P>
      <P>An added factor is the level of applications being received at any time. In this regard the number of applications received has increased considerably e.g. in 1993 the number of applications for naturalisation received was 256 while in 1997 it was 650 and, in 1998, 588.</P>
      <P>A total of eight officers deal exclusively with naturalisation and citizenship matters in my Department. In the past, staff were diverted to other duties but I have recently restored the staffing complement of the section and this should contribute to ensuring that the processing time for applications is not unnecessarily protracted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's responsibilities with regard to the Government's policy on children and on the family are both legislative and administrative.</P>
      <P>The range of legislative responsibilities in the civil law area with regard to children and the family includes guardianship and custody of children; maintenance; matrimonial property; separation and divorce; nullity of marriage; succession rights, parental leave, adoptive leave, maternity protection, employment equality and protection against domestic violence. My Department has responsibility for the central authority for child abduction and the central authority for maintenance recovery. Also, it has an overseeing role in relation to the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to criminal law, criminal legislation generally makes no distinction as between children and adults in its overall aim to protect <Col N="1137" /> citizens. However, there are provisions in the criminal law aimed specifically at protecting children for which my Department is responsible. In addition, my Department has responsibility for juvenile justice legislation.</P>
    <P>The Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1998, made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government on 14 February 1998, delegated the powers and duties of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform conferred on him by or under the Children Acts, 1908 to 1989, to Frank Fahey T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Consequent to that delegation, the Minister of State has responsibility for progressing the Children Bill, 1996, through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Matters relating to juvenile justice can be heard at any level in the courts, i.e. District, Circuit, High or Supreme Courts, for which the Minister is currently responsible. Sections 15 and 16 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, provides for the admission as evidence in court of video recordings of statements to a garda or other competent person by alleged victims under 14 years of age of a sexual or violent offences. A committee has been established to prepare guidelines for persons carrying out such interviews. Arrangments are already in place for the giving of evidence by child witnesses via a live television link. At present this is only available in two courtrooms in Dublin but consideration is being given to extending it to other major centres throughout the country. I requested the Working Group on a Courts Commission to examine the issue of Family Law Courts and they have now submitted their sixth and final report which includes an analysis of and recommendations on family law courts. My Department is currently considering the proposals. Given the poor condition of many court buildings thoughout the country, a major courts building programme is under way which includes provision of a family law suite in all major towns as part of each new or refurbishment project.</P>
    <P>The role of the Garda Síochána is a very broad one covering society as a whole but includes such areas as protecting the public peace, crime detection and prevention and the provision of guidance, assurance and assistance to the public, all of which, of course, impact on young people and families. The gardaí are actively engaged in assisting young people at risk through their involvement in, for example, the juvenile liaison and youth diversion projects. They are also involved in awareness/education programmes in schools.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service has responsibility for the management and supervision of children and young persons on probation orders from the courts. It also provides a service to special schools (industrial and reformatory) under the aegis of the Department of Education and supervises those when the Minister for Education releases on licence under the <Col N="1138" /> provision of the Children Act, 1908. The Family Law Act, 1995, the Family (Divorce) Act, 1996, and the Children (Guardian ad Litem) Act, 1997, specify that in certain circumstances the court may seek a social report from an officer of the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>My Department and the prison service have responsibility for children aged 15 to 17 who are committed to prison. Males and females under the age of 15 cannot be committed to prison. Males aged 15 and females aged 15 or 16 may be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances whereby court rules that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he-she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided by the Department of Education. Special arrangements are made on the committal of a 15 year old male or a 15 or 16 year old female offender including allocation to a single cell and designation of a prison officer to remain with the offender during all out-of-cell times. Such committals are used only as a last resort by the courts. Long standing policy in accordance with international practice dictates that, when possible, prisoners are located in the institution closest to their home address to facilitate family contact. Male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be committed on remand or to serve a period of detention at St. Patrick's Institution. Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the five committal prisons (Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea) and from St. Patrick's Institution to Wheatfield, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Censorship of Publications Board, my Department has responsibility for prohibiting the sale and distribution of publications which are  indecent or obscene, advocate abortion and dwell unduly on aspects of crime.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Film Censor is responsible for the censorship of films and video recordings. The Censorship of Films Act, 1923, provides that no picture shall be exhibited unless and until the censor has certified it as fit for exhibition. The Video Recordings Act, 1989, provides for the control and regulation of the supply and importation of video recordings. The two main provisions of this Act, in relation to policy concerning children and the family, are (a) it provides that the film censor may, on grounds specified in the Act, prohibit the supply of video films which are considered unsuitable for viewing, and (b) it provides for the classification of video films in terms of their suitability for viewing by different age groups.</P>
    <P>The National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which was established in December, 1997 and is chaired by Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State in my Department, is looking at a wide variety of issues in response to the needs of women experiencing all form of violence, including domestic violence.</P>
    <P>My Department, in co-operation with the EU, has developed a two-year equal opportunities <Col N="1139" /> childcare programme. This programme, which I launched in July 1998, involves expenditure of approximately £6 million and is aimed at developing locally based childcare facilities to assist parents to reconcile family and working responsibilities and focuses particularly on the provision of those facilities in disadvantaged areas. Funding is also being provided from the European Social Fund and the Exchequer for the establishment of a national childcare database.</P>
    <P>My Department chaired the Expert Working Group on Childcare which was established under Partnership 2000 in July 1997 to devise a national framework for the development of childcare services in Ireland. The group finalised a report and recommendations in December 1998. The report will be launched on Wednesday, 3 February 1999.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a commitment in Partnership 2000 to support the growth of family policies, my Department is arranging for a round table forum on family friendly policies in the workplace to be held on 25 February 1999 involving the social partners, relevant Government Departments and agencies and a number of public and private sector employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department does not have specific responsibility for areas of Government policy concerning children or the family, it does have responsibility for overseeing implementation of elements of the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development 1994-1999 in conjunction with Area Development Management Ltd, focusing especially on promoting integrated development of the most disadvantaged areas through enterprise and job creation, community capacity building and education initiatives; on a priority and co-ordinated basis. This targeted response in areas of need has had a positive impact on children and families, albeit in a secondary way to the primary aims.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation chairs the Inter-Departmental Committee on Local Development which has responsibility for the Integrated Services Project (ISP). The purpose of the ISP is to develop new procedures to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities to the needs of communities with the greatest levels of disadvantage, as a basis for a model of best practice. The implementation of ISP will involve both longer-term generic changes as well as quality of life improvements across a wide range of State services. It is anticipated that the projects focus on enhanced service delivery with local consultation will impact in a positive way on families and children in the target areas in a real and sustainable way.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Department's responsibilities in relation to sport and recreation also contribute, indirectly of course, through the emphasis on family and child anticipation, to the furtherance of the Government's policy on children and the family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case made by the school in question in support of its application for disadvantaged area status. However, I am not aware of any reliable data which would support the suggestion that the level of educational attainment in Edenderry is considerably below the national average.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage. My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the educational system.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the school to which they refer will be considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>An application has been received from County Wicklow Vocational Education Committee for the provision of a PE hall at Arklow Community College.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at this school can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally. Because of the huge demand for accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when a PE hall will be provided in this particular case.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that this application will continue to be reviewed in light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>A total of 14 project areas were selected for support. Unfortunately, the group to which the Deputy refers was not successful on this occasion. All applicants were advised of the outcome of the selection process in August, 1998.</P>
      <P>It is open to the group to submit a written application through County Dublin VEC for an allocation of teaching hours. If such an application is received it will be considered by my Department in the normal way.</P>

      <P>The number of contracts awarded, or approved, by my Department since July 1997 would run to thousands and it would take an inordinate level of resources to compile details of each of them. However, it has been a long-standing practice for my Department to adhere to EU and Government contracts committee procedures in award of contracts. Furthermore, my Department's tender and contract procedures are subject to audit by internal auditors, the Comptroller and Auditor General, and EU auditors.</P>
      <P>The information on consultancies is being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a concern about the procedures used in any contract, or consultancy, awarded or approved by my Department, I will have the case examined.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third-level course. I would point out to the Deputy that this condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand that similar residency requirements operate in the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The removal of this residency condition for Irish nationals would have to apply to EU nationals generally and could have significant resource implications for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I would further point out to the Deputy, the EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of a local authority from 1 October of the year prior to going to college may apply for assistance under the higher education grants scheme. In this regard, EU nationals who do not satisfy the residency requirement under the free fees initiative may apply to have their fees paid if they satisfy the residency requirement (of one year in an EU member state) and the means test under the scheme.</P>

      <P>In addition, my Department is engaged in implementing the range of specific measures relating to educational provision which have been set down in the Government's Programme. The measures in question include recognition of the important role of parents in the education of their children.</P>
