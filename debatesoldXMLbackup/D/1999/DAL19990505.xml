    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following the meetings with the main parties I held jointly with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, the week before last, and our conference calls with the parties in Belfast, a round-table meeting was held in Belfast aimed at breaking the current impasse. This followed on meetings that had taken place on a bilateral and multilateral basis at official level involving the pro-Agreement parties. The two Governments and the parties explored a range of strategies about how to make progress. The talks, which were jointly hosted by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and Minister Adam Ingram, were useful and all the parties are focused on the priority objective &ndash; the establishment of the executive.</P>
      <P>I met the Sinn Féin President, Mr. Gerry Adams, last Saturday week and we subsequently spoke on the telephone. Mr Adams and I reviewed the situation with regard to how best to progress the implementation of the Agreement. I am satisfied the leadership of Sinn Féin remains committed to finding a way through the current difficulties on the basis of securing a sufficiently wide consensus.</P>
      <P>It is important for people to continue to propose and explore different strategies for making progress and, in that spirit, John Hume's proposal has been helpful. I know the proposal has not found favour on all sides, but we have to work our way towards making progress through continuing dialogue and discussions and, hopefully, we will find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> In the light of the discussions that have taken place, the Prime Minister and I decided to meet the parties in London tomorrow. We do not have one fixed strategy that we believe will be acceptable to the parties, but we are working on a range of ideas within which we hope there are some that will be conducive to moving matters forward. The implementation of the Agreement in full is the only way forward. All the parties are anxious that we move in the near term and it remains the position of the two Governments that the Agreement should enter into effect and the institutions be established with their full powers and functions at the earliest possible moment. We all need to concentrate on building the confidence necessary to retain the inclusivity of the process and to enable people to take the steps that are needed. We cannot afford to wait too long and let the support needed on all sides seep away. Our mandate for the implementation of the Agreement comes from the people and whatever happens in the days ahead, we remain totally committed to its full implementation.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to contact President Clinton but close contact is being maintained with the United States Administration at other levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions arise, bearing in mind that 12 questions were taken together. In the meeting the Taoiseach had on Saturday week last with the President of Sinn Féin and the subsequent telephone conversation, did the leadership of Sinn Féin give any indication or outline any proposals it might have for overcoming the current impasse? Does the leadership accept there is an impasse? If it accepts there is an impasse, bearing in mind the suggestion made by John Hume, to which the Taoiseach already made reference in his reply, has the President of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, suggested to the Taoiseach, in the various meetings and conversations he has had with him since these questions were put down, a proposal for overcoming the impasse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin and everybody else accepts there is an impasse; there is no debate or argument about that. Sinn Féin has put forward some proposals. I believe a range of proposals have been put forward. Sinn Féin's preferred option would be the setting up of the executive&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot deal with that if it accepts there is an impasse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;as soon as possible and perhaps those in Sinn Féin are working to build confidence and assure the other parties that they remain genuinely committed to fulfilling the Agreement as they see it and as the Agreement is written. They have no new proposal that deals with the totality of the problems of all the other <Col N="140" /> parties, and that is what the two Governments have to try to find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they expressed a view to the Taoiseach informally as to the desirability or acceptability of the proposal recently put forward by John Hume?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed it because it was on that day that John Hume's proposal came into the public domain. I believe they discussed it before then and since, but I understand there was some contact with John Hume prior to that also. They find parts of it acceptable, as do others, but nobody finds the proposal as it stands acceptable. Meetings were held last week, as Deputy Quinn would know, in which they tried to bring this forward. As far as we are concerned, John Hume's proposal is one of the proposals that is still on the table. The Unionists, of course, have some difficulties with that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>But Sinn Féin has not rejected it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the comments made by Martin McGuinness in the United States today that he believes the whole process is in jeopardy? Given that the Taoiseach is reported as rejecting the plan for the transitional executive put forward by the Northern Ireland Office, does he intend to bring proposals to Mr. Blair this week that he can outline to the House? What will the Government suggest in place of the Northern Ireland Office suggestion? Does the Taoiseach have any suggestion to get over this impasse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many ideas and suggestions have been put forward. I am not sure from where the NIO suggestion came the other day. That was not a proposal put forward in a range of proposals from the British Government; I am not sure of the status of that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Taoiseach rejected it anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not one of the ten or so proposals which the Governments have been working on so it is not open to discussion. We have two or three proposals into which we have put considerable work since Hillsborough. We have talked privately to the parties about these proposals and tried to move forward but it would be wrong to build up too much hope regarding these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government also has proposals. The official level meetings which started today are trying to narrow the proposals to see if we can come up with one which bridges the gap, prior to the Prime Minister Mr. Blair or I joining the talks. Some of the proposals will be acceptable to the UUP and some to Sinn Féin. However, we have not been able to come up with a proposal accept<Col N="141" /> able to all sides and that is what we must try to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that confidence building measures will, I hope, bring an end to this impasse, will the Taoiseach join me in commending the meeting which took place between David Trimble and Breandán MacCionnaith of the Garvaghy Road residents? This was a courageous meeting as Mr. Trimble, Bríd Rodgers and others had to run the gauntlet of appalling abuse. Will the Taoiseach commend Mr. Trimble for his actions? Does he intend to demand of Mr. Blair a full, independent inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate those involved in yesterday's meeting. The two Governments have been pursuing this initiative since Christmas. This was a brave move by Mr. Trimble because of the difficulties in his constituency and with the groups. We have always held the view that we will only make progress through dialogue. Yesterday's dialogue was constructive and useful.</P>
      <P>Anyone close to the talks knows that the festering sore of Drumcree is contagious and spreads to the rest of the talks. We must attempt to deal with Drumcree before dealing with the overall talks. I am not sure how much is achievable but we must try. Like everyone else I would like to see an agreement on Drumcree based on dialogue. Feelings run very high in this area. I have met members of the community, all the public representatives from the area and members of the Orange Order. This initiative can lead to progress and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Last week I told the House that discussions were ongoing between the two Governments on the Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane cases. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, met Pat Finucane's widow some time ago and received a copy of a report by the British human rights group into the allegations. The Department prepared an analysis of the report which is the subject of discussions between the two Governments. We continue to put forward our views on the Rosemary Nelson case. We have spoken to the families and the groups and what I said to the House in the past few weeks still holds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree it is the earnest aspiration of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, particularly those in working class communities, that the marching season passes without the awful tension, stand-offs and violence which characterised recent years? Working class communities suffer most in these situations. Will the Taoiseach agree there has to be compromise on all sides about the two conflicting rights &ndash; the right to parade and express one's culture and the right of communities not to be harassed and intimidated by unwanted parades? In light of the horrors in Kosovo, does the Taoiseach think that the right <Col N="142" /> which should take precedence is the right of communities not to be thrust by sectarian extremists into horrific sectarian conflict, such as that which took the lives of the Quinn children and others last year? Does the Taoiseach have any news from last night's meeting between Unionist leaders and residents of Garvaghy Road and Portadown which might give an indication of what will happen as regards Drumcree and the Garvaghy Road this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary reports from last night's meeting indicate there was a good exchange of views with useful dialogue where people put their cases. There was no great resolution. However, I have always believed that it is good for people to talk and exchange views. Possibilities have been looked at by various mediators, including Frank Blair and three people who acted as intermediaries in last autumn's negotiations. The Parades Commission and other civil rights groups have looked at this in the past four or five years. As we move towards what is known in the North as the Drumcree Five, all of what Deputy Higgins said is true. We must ensure that we investigate every possible way of reducing sectarian tensions which always seem to unnecessarily permeate these marches.</P>
      <P>The number of marches has grown dramatically in the past decade and there are now up to 3,000 marches a year. The vast majority of those marches pass off peacefully, not because there is no potential for trouble but because people go out of their way to develop community relationships. Civic, religious, political and community leaders meet with each other to try to ensure the marches pass off peacefully. In the past few years there have probably been about ten potential flashpoints. Both Governments, the NIO, the police force and others are trying to do all they can to get communities involved in constructive dialogue on these marches so an understanding can be reached. We saw how this happened last year in the Lower Ormeau Road and Derry where there were no difficulties. There is a basis for making progress, as the Deputy outlined, to try to decrease tension. A major part of that is finding a constructive resolution and having ongoing dialogue on the Portadown situation, which is the most difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was heartened a meeting took place between the First Minister, David Trimble, and the representatives of residents of Garvaghy Road. On the widely perceived impasse, has the Taoiseach contacted or does he have plans to contact George Mitchell in the light of his tantalising references to possibilities and hope for the future? Perhaps he would say more in private conversation than he would be prepared to say in public. In the meeting the Taoiseach had with Yasser Arafat, was there any reference to Northern Ireland and any comparisons in conflict resolution which might help us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Has the Taoiseach had contact with Church leaders and does he see a role for them in broaching some of the difficulties in communication? Has thought been given to the requests which will be made to Deputies and Senators to visit as observers on the Garvaghy Road or any other place where the Nationalist community feels besieged and would appreciate some objective viewpoints? Does the Taoiseach think this would be helpful?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to comment on that. However, in other years I have been supportive of observers. Last year there were observers from the European Parliament who did much good in reducing tension. These matters should be communicated to the NIO and others so that they are not misinterpreted. That is the only possible difficulty, but it has not happened in recent years. We have not formed a view on what should happen this year. I hope the direct talks, which are the most meaningful, will make some progress in that regard. However, I will say something later on that if it is necessary.</P>
      <P>I discussed Northern Ireland with President Yasser Arafat in a general way and updated him on the problems. I keep in touch with Senator George Mitchell. I discussed matters with him last month when I met him in Washington. He keeps in touch and has made some statements in the past day or two on his views on decommissioning and other matters. He remains helpful. I do not think his direct involvement is the issue at this stage, but he is very helpful and keeps in touch with many of the people he has got to know very well in the North, across all sectors of the community.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Sargent, the most positive aspect is probably the immense growing number of religious, community people, organisations and groups from the North coming to Dublin and twinning and building relationships with towns, chambers of commerce and sporting organisations around the country. These groups would not traditionally have set foot in the South on a formal basis. There have been some interesting inquiries from groups which did not inquire very much of Irish Governments in the past. The Minister, Deputy Andrews, might speak about that during the summer. There are really good communications and dialogues building up all the time.</P>
      <P>The negative aspect is the people who were protesting yesterday, those who make life hell in Portadown and who continue to think there is another way of solving these matters. They are still there. We must continue to work with the majority to convince people to move away from that. However, matters generally are far more positive than negative, which is allowing the political leaders to make moves they were unable to make in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="144" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach had a meeting with Mr. Adams and other party leaders recently. Did he discuss with Mr. Adams the modalities that have been agreed for decommissioning? The first modality is the transfer or hand over of arms and weapons, which all sides agree has proven very difficult and is unlikely to produce a positive dividend in the immediate future. Did the Taoiseach discuss with Mr. Adams the second agreed modality, which is the provision of information? Did he request from Mr. Adams the up to date position on the role of Mr. Martin McGuinness as liaison officer with General de Chastelain? Did Mr. Adams express any hope that, if there is not to be movement in the transfer of arms, there may be a glimmer of hope on the matter of the provision of information, which both Governments have accepted would, in effect, lead to real progress? </P>
      <P>My second question relates to the Taoiseach's meeting with Mr. Blair. I refer the Taoiseach to an undertaking or promise made by the British Government last autumn that it would make a normalisation report on demilitarisation, which would be important in the context of confidence building. There is no sign of this report. Does the Taoiseach agree this report has become somewhat stalled, in the setting up of the executive?</P>
      <P>There are three weeks to the deadline for implementing the changes to the Constitution passed by the people in the referendum a year ago. Is the Taoiseach considering extending that deadline in view of the current impasse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Flanagan's question about the modalities is yes, both in terms of the modalities and the information. The Deputy answered the first part of the question himself in that the modalities are unlikely to lead to anything in the short term, although Sinn Féin will still be strongly committed to the date of April 2000 which is in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>On information matters, the word of the chairperson of the international commission on decommissioning, General Jean de Chastelain, is that the meetings with Martin McGuinness have continued and they have continued to be useful and productive. I cannot vouch for the information's accuracy, but General de Chastelain would have a firm view on what he is talking about and on his remit. I heard that stated a number of times in private conversation with him. The answer to the Deputy's question on that is yes, it has continued to be constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normalisation report was due to be released in the autumn. There have been many drafts as well as ongoing debate and discussion over the winter and spring. The answer to the Deputy's question in that regard is yes. It has become related to the setting up of the Executive. While the normalisation paper was not to be a part of the ongoing process, the issues in it would be central to making progress. The British Government would have concerns about putting <Col N="145" /> forward everything while not knowing where things stand on decommissioning and other issues. While the Government does not necessarily subscribe to that, I can understand its point of view.</P>
    <P>I try to progress the normalisation issue because it is important in itself. The Secretary of State, Dr. Mowlam, has taken some of the items in that paper and progressed them anyway. The occupation of the Crossmaglen Rangers Gaelic pitch for the best part of 30 years was one of those issues and it has now been dealt with. Removal of the army base from the pitch has commenced and commitments on the matter have been given to the President of the GAA and to local politicians. The publication of the report, however, is likely to get tied up with the other issues.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's third question, we have started examining the constitutional position. Early June is the proposed date and if progress is not made over the next week or so, the Government must be prepared to bring a Bill before the House to extend the deadline. It is my intention to extend the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach is in discussions with some of the parties involved, particularly Sinn Féin and the Unionist Party, does he remind them that they are not simply talking about a document called the Good Friday Agreement, that they are talking about the Irish people as a whole, North and South, having expressed their determination in this respect and that we are not just requesting these bodies to implement the wish of the Irish people so expressed but demanding that they implement what the Irish people voted for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach recall the words of one of the founders of the EU who said that when one <Col N="146" /> is faced with a problem which seems insurmountable, the only thing to do is to change the context of that problem? Would he agree that this appeared to be attempted in the Hillsborough Declaration but that it requires more imagination now that a year has expired? Perhaps he should bear in mind the wise words of one of the founders of a successful experiment in the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must continue to try to find a resolution.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's point that the mandate for the implementation agreement comes from the people, that is what I stated in my reply. We are answerable to the people, whatever happens, and we remain totally committed to its full implementation. However, therein lies the problem. What the written word means for one side in terms of the implementation of the Agreement is different for the other side in terms of the interpretation of practical politics. The Hillsborough Declaration tried to reconcile what we understood were political realities with what we thought was a fair interpretation, as substantially documented in the Agreement. However, it was not possible to complete the circles in that document.</P>
      <P>We have continued to explore this and to carry all the parties. One of the criticisms of the Hillsborough Declaration was that the smaller parties were not always part of the negotiations. We are trying to include them now. It is a slower process because we are trying to negotiate and keep everyone together. I appreciate their efforts and patience. At the same time, I would like to think that people would sign up to at least one of the many suggestions put forward by the two Governments which are not outrageous or unreasonable. We will try again over the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The next EU Council will take place in Cologne on 3 and 4 June. It is not yet clear whether Chancellor Schröder will undertake another tour of capitals in advance of it given that he undertook a tour prior to the Berlin Summit. It is possible instead that the Chancellor will consult his EU partners by phone to outline his ideas for the summit. I last met Chancellor Schröder at the informal European Council in Brussels on 14 April and prior to that at the Berlin European Council on 24-25 March. I last wrote to the Chancellor on 23 March, when I outlined the discussions I had held with the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Primakov in Shannon that day.</P>
      <P>I have invited the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, who incidentally was formally approved by the EU Parliament today, to meet me in Dublin in advance of the Cologne Summit. In light of my discussions with the Tánaiste and Mr. Prodi, the Government will formally nominate a candidate who will be in a position to hold a high profile portfolio. A date for that visit has not been decided as yet.</P>
      <P>In addition to these political level meetings, I will meet Ministers and officials from the relevant Government Departments, as appropriate, in relation to the issues on the agenda of the Cologne Summit.</P>
      <P>I met briefly the Australian Governor General, Sir William Deane, and Lady Deane, at Government Buildings on Friday 30 April. I also hosted a lunch for them on the same day. I had an opportunity to discuss a range of issues with Sir William and I briefed him on developments in Ireland, including the economy.</P>
      <P>We also discussed the Northern Ireland Peace Process. I expressed our appreciation for Australia's generous contributions to the International Fund for Ireland. Sir William told me of his visit to an Australian-funded cross-Border project in Dundalk and I expressed the hope that Australia would continue to contribute to such important projects in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> I thanked Sir William for the constant support we have received from Australia in our campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council. We also discussed the extensive cultural links between our countries, and the recent very successful State visit to Australia by President McAleese.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, that if the GNP of all 11 applicant states is added together it amounts to GNP the size of a medium sized existing state such as the Netherlands or Belgium and that there are major challenges in the next process of enlargement? Will he agree the whole <i>raison d'etre </i>for the European Union is illustrated by what is happening in Kosovo and that we need enlargement just as much as the applicant states? When are we likely to see momentum for the whole process of enlargement given that the issue of Agenda 2000 is out of the way? Has the Government made a decision or considered the matter of who will be Ireland's next European Commissioner? In relation to Kovovo, will the Taoiseach agree we have disgraced ourselves in the way we have approached the whole question of taking refugees, that we should have a specific generous quota in mind and that our preparations should be much more advanced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated many times that as soon as Agenda 2000 was finished with the discussions on enlargement would be stepped up. The Commission has been going through the analysis of the economies, the difficulties with the countries involved and the early stages since early last year. That work is continuing. The enlargement issue will be moved forward if not at the Cologne summit, probably at the summit in the second half of the year. I agree &ndash; and I think everybody else agrees &ndash; that has to happen. The period of examination to see how these economies develop and in what timescale, are all matters on which the Commission reports. At that stage it will become the task of the new President of the Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi. He spoke about that at the meeting in Brussels on 14 April.</P>
      <P>The Government has not yet given any thought to the appointment of a Commissioner. Mr. Prodi said that once he was appointed, he would speak to us at an early date. I look forward to hearing from him shortly as his appointment was ratified today.</P>
      <P>Regarding Kosovo, Ireland has in no way disgraced itself. Refugees will start arriving next Monday. I am not sure of the final figure but we said that initially we would take 1,000. The first group includes 150 people and arrangements for their arrival have been made over recent weeks. The figure of 1,000 is relatively high given Ireland's size and we will play our part. There has been close contact between Departments and agencies and the UN High Commissioner in the intervening period.</P>

      <P>Regarding the meeting which is due to take place soon with the newly elected President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, has the Government considered possible nominees whose names may be put forward for consideration by Mr. Prodi?

      <P>As I said, the Government has not given great thought to the matter. It is on my mind, but the Government has not yet taken action. Under his new powers, Mr. Prodi is obliged to discuss the people he is seeking for his Commission. This should happen as early as possible. We must ensure that we nominate a person of high calibre who fits the bill and this will be done.</P>
      <P>Many of my colleagues on the European Council believe that nothing much will happen until after the European elections, perhaps in July, and that the matter will drift on until later in the year. I would prefer to move more quickly but I am not sure what will happen in the rest of Europe. However, we should try to deal with it quickly.</P>

      <P>Before we commence questions, may I remind Members of the new procedure that comes into effect today. Members have been circulated with a detailed note on these changes, a copy of which is also before you in the House.</P>
      <P>Under the new procedures strict time limits are imposed and these will be enforced strictly by the Chair. The new arrangements for Priority Questions reflect the procedure that was previously in place for much of last year, and Members will be familiar with them. Thirty minutes will be allocated overall for Priority Questions and each priority question will be given six minutes, the first two minutes for the Minister's initial reply and the remaining four minutes for supplementary questions and replies. A similar arrangement is now in place for ordinary oral questions, excluding questions to the Taoiseach, and that is six minutes overall, two minutes for a Minister's reply and four minutes overall for supplementaries, with the addition that of the four minutes allowed for supplementary questions, one minute maximum will be allowed for each supplementary question and for each ministerial reply thereto. These time limits double or treble up when two or more oral questions are taken together, subject to 18 minutes overall, with the exception of supplementaries which remain at one minute. Written questions grouped with orals have no effect on time limits. The intention is that the new procedure will ensure each priority question is taken without overrunning into ordinary Question Time and that more ordinary questions will be dealt with. I ask Members to co-operate with the Chair in observing the strict time limits imposed by the new sessional order.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and am glad he is taking this matter seriously. As he knows, the case arose from an assault with a bottle by the son of a then-serving member of the Garda Síochána on a bouncer, who sustained considerable injuries. The case was adjourned until the February sitting of Castlerea District Court but was called in January, although it should not have been called and was not on the original list.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement to the House on 20 April I outlined the proposed pension arrangements for the former Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty and the former Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly. In the case of Mr. O'Flaherty the capital value of the proposed <i>ex gratia</i> pension arrangement of £40,000 per year commencing on 18 April 1999 is estimated by the Department of Finance at £699,000. In the case of Mr. Kelly the capital value of the proposed <i>ex gratia</i> pension arrangement of £30,000 per year commencing on 21 April 1999 is estimated, also by the Department of Finance, at £665,000.</P>
      <P>No undertakings whatever were given verbally or in writing to the two former judges in regard to the pensions they would receive, either before or after their resignations had been received. The Government agreed that the pensions I have mentioned should be proposed for payment, subject to Dáil approval. That approval will be requested formally when I seek to have the necessary pensions legislation passed by both Houses. I hope to introduce this legislation in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No conditions were attached, proposed, or planned to be attached to their pension arrangements. I am formally advised by the Attorney General that it would be unconstitutional to include in legislation &ndash; providing for pensions or payments to judges or former judges &ndash; provision that payment would be dependent on the individual judges complying with a requirement that they provide some explanation or self-justifi<Col N="155" /> cation or make themselves available to give evidence before an Oireachtas Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that there is no legal obligation to pay more than the statutory entitlement to either of these individuals. Why was an enhanced offer made, who negotiated it and had the specific deal been approved by the Government? Did I understand the Minister correctly that legislation rather than a motion will be introduced to give effect to this deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now it looks as if legislation will be introduced, but the House will have to approve the deal. As to why the Government decided to pay pensions to the judges, it took the view that, from the information available, the errors of judgments by three individuals, including these two individuals, were quite serious but took into account that all three had taken the honourable course by resigning and had collectively helped to avert a difficult if not unprecedented position, from a constitutional standpoint. The view was therefore taken that some recognition should be given to this in their severance arrangements. All three individuals and their families are facing enormous losses on their loss of office. I am sure Deputy Howlin will accept that the two former judges and the former county registrar were entitled, as a result of their period of service, to a lump sum and a pension at their respective retirement ages. The Oireachtas will be required to approve any arrangement and it is a matter for the parties and Deputies.</P>

Will he confirm that there was such negotiation and say who conducted it on behalf of Mr. Kelly and on behalf of the Department?</P>

      <P>There were negotiations relating to the case of the former Mr. Justice Kelly but the arrangements for him had not been finalised at the time he resigned &ndash; no deal had been completed with him. My understanding is that Mr. Kelly's negotiations were conducted by his legal advisers. They faced a counsel acting for the Attorney General, who was briefed by a senior official in my Department, who in turn conferred with me and senior officials of the Department of Finance throughout. The eventual figure struck was agreed by the Government.</P>
      <P>At no point did either Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, as he then was, or Mr. Michael Quinlan, the former county registrar, seek a pension from the Government. Both resigned without broaching the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to introduce a register of sex offenders. In February last I sought and obtained Cabinet approval for the preparation of a Bill to provide for the establishment of such a register, the principal focus of which will be offences against children.</P>
      <P>The Bill will also deal with post-release supervision of sex offenders by the Probation and Welfare Service and separate legal representation in certain circumstances for complainants of rape and serious sexual assault. In addition, I hope to include in the Bill a new civil court order against a sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda reasonable cause for concern that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. I am also examining the possible creation of a new offence for a convicted child sex offender to look for or accept employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children.</P>
      <P>These measures arise, in the main, from the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I published in May of last year and are in line with the responses received to that paper. The measures raise complex legal and constitutional issues which will inevitably influence the shape of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparation of this legislation will continue to be given a high priority within my Department. I expect to be in a position to circulate the heads of the Bill to all Departments next week, with a view to bringing the matter before Government by the end of this month, for approval to draft. I hope the Bill will be published shortly thereafter. <Col N="159" /> Clearly, much will depend on successfully dealing with the legal and constitutional issues involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. What will be the registration procedures, to whom will they apply and will the notification requirement extend to those convicted of similar offences in the UK? What requirements are envisaged for the disclosure of information and to whom will they apply? By whom will information be disclosed and what will be the extent of such disclosures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The sex offenders' register will be similar to those which operate in Britain and Northern Ireland. It will be a tracking system, a means for the Garda to be aware, at all times, of the addresses of convicted offenders who, on their release from prison, will have to notify their names and addresses to the Garda. Any subsequent changes to their names and addresses will have to be similarly notified. Failure to notify will be an offence. The length of time a person's name must remain on the register will be set out in the Bill, probably by reference to the seriousness of the offence and with some modification for juvenile offenders. If it is feasible to extend the notification requirements to sex offenders coming here from abroad, that will be done. That should act as a deterrent to any child sex offenders coming here from those jurisdictions. The UK law does not extend to persons leaving the UK. The purpose of the register is preventative not punitive. It will be an administrative vehicle enabling the gardaí to keep track of the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville asked who would have access to the register. The gardaí in consultation with the relevant State agencies, such as the probation and welfare service and health boards, will undertake continuous risk assessment of those whose names will be on the register. Information will be disclosed only to other persons in the most exceptional circumstances in order to prevent an immediate risk of crime or to alert members of the public to the apprehended danger and then, only on a strict need to know basis, administrative arrangements will be put in place to this end.</P>

      <P>Grave consideration must be given to what the Deputy suggested. The length of time for which an individual should remain on the register must be based upon the seriousness of the offence in the first instance. The intention at this time is to have a sliding scale based on the seriousness of the offence. There are likely to be circumstances where an individual would find his name on the register for all of his life.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 1998 a total of 2,015 persons were reported to the gardaí as missing, of whom 14 remained untraced at the end of the year. While it is of little consolation to the families of the loved ones who are still missing, over 99 per cent of those who are reported missing turn up.</P>
      <P>As I previously told the House, the Trace group, which consists of an assistant commissioner, one superintendent, one inspector, two detective sergeants and two detective gardaí, is based in Naas Garda station. The group was set up to specifically re-examine a number of the original investigations of missing persons cases. It has begun this task by initially reviewing the cases of six high profile missing persons cases. I am informed by the Garda authorities that other cases that may be relevant are also being reviewed.</P>
      <P>Operation Trace, since its inception, has attracted widespread media interest. This, coupled with the TV series &ldquo;Solved and Unsolved&rdquo;, has encouraged the public to report incidents not previously reported. We would all agree that, in general, media interest and coverage of the operation has been positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operation Trace is currently collating information received from within the force and the public on crimes and incidents involving a sexual element. This information is being analysed and <Col N="161" /> added to the database of known sexual offenders maintained in the Trace incident room. I am informed that the examination of the original investigation files is ongoing and that currently new information is being processed and pursued. As the House is aware, searches have been carried out in a number of areas. I am further informed that a number of interviews have been conducted to date with persons who have been linked to the investigation. As the House will appreciate, in investigations such as this, progress is slow and time consuming. It is, however, felt that the operation will yield benefits. I am informed that the terms of reference of the investigation have not been expanded since its inception.</P>
    <P>I am aware of public concern about the issue, which I share. The Garda Commissioner is doing all he can to ensure that effective arrangements are in place and the necessary resources are made available to trace those who are reported missing.</P>

        <b>: </b>The initiative, Operation Trace, announced last September, has been in existence for the past nine months and has been taking a cold look at the files of a selected number of victims. Will the Minister acknowledge that while that operation is well intentioned it is getting nowhere? Will he agree that what is needed is what he promised prior to coming into Government, a specially assigned, designated and trained unit to look into the issue of missing persons? Members of the Garda Síochána require retraining and need to adopt best practice as operates in other jurisdictions. It is necessary as a matter of urgency that we acknowledge this fact and put our people into training schemes and systems that are proving effective in other jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>I have taken a very great interest in missing persons since assuming office. I have had a number of conversations with the Garda Commissioner about what I regard as a very serious situation. The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has taken initiatives and the question of the value of a centralised Garda national missing persons unit is kept under continuous review. I understand from the Garda Commissioner that he considers investigations of missing persons are more effective when they have the type of local focus that is achieved under present arrangements. Local officers have available to them, as required, the services of all the specialist units and manpower that are part of the overall Garda organisation structure.</P>
      <P>The Trace unit, which is headed by an assistant commissioner, has been in operation for some time. That unit was established last year by the Garda Commissioner for the express purpose of examining a number of untraced missing persons. We have been very proactive in dealing with this very disquieting and tragic problem.</P>

        <b>: </b>On a related issue, does the Minister consider it is appropriate that an <Col N="162" /> apology should issue to the family of the missing Jo Jo Dullard in light of the comments in <i>The Star</i> some time ago? Those comments were attributed to a member of the Garda Síochána investigating the case. He is reported to have said that &ldquo;the more time passes the more I believe it was suicide&rdquo;. Will the Minister instruct that an apology be given to the members of the Dullard family? The pain and hurt is real enough without a member of the Garda Síochána peddling his unfounded assumption about this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was committed to Castlerea Prison on 9 October 1998. He is serving a four year sentence for rape and is not due for release with remission under 8 October 2001.</P>
      <P>The request for private treatment was refused for the following reasons. First, the State has a legal responsibility for medical and therapeutic services provided to prisoners. As a matter of policy, this is interpreted as ensuring that prisoners are provided with standards and services equivalent to those available to citizens in the general community covered by the medical card scheme. Second, I could not accept any proposal which would circumvent this principle of State responsibility and accountability as it applied to prisoners.</P>
      <P>If medical practitioners, social workers or counsellors not employed or retained by the Prison Service were to have access to prisoners on a frequent basis, the Prison Service would not have any real control over the treatment prescribed or given to offenders seen by those people. The net result would be to divest the prison medical service, and ultimately the Minister, of actual responsibility for the health and therapeutic care of prisoners in its broader sense while, legal responsibility in the strict sense would remain with them. This would be contrary to existing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a prison operational aspect, an absolute requirement is the consistency of treatment of prisoners. This applies equally to health and therapeutic care. If certain prisoners were <Col N="163" /> allowed access to private therapy at their own expense all others would want the same concession or facility and, given that most would not have the means to pay for private treatment, this would pose a problem in the context of equality of treatment of prisoners generally.</P>
    <P>The treatment prescribed might involve the release of the sex offender into the community. That too might put the State in a position where it could not meet its responsibilities to protect the community during the period of the sentence.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy will, along with all other convicted sex offenders, be invited to apply to participate in the sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison. The next programme will begin in September and prior to this applications will be invited from all prisoners. The person referred to by the Deputy was seen by the probation and welfare officer on committal and on three other occasions since. He has not expressed an interest in this programme to date.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being short sighted in the extreme. The parents of this young man have had the initiative and interest in the welfare of their child to engage a private company &ndash; the Granada Institute, which is expert in this kind of therapeutic service &ndash; to provide at their own expense a rehabilitation programme for their son so that when he is released he can have a normal existence with the benefit of treatment which the State is effectively denying him.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to the question, the State has a legal responsibility in the treatment of offenders. It has a legal responsibility for their medical and therapeutic treatment. That is a principle which I cannot abrogate in response to the Deputy's question. Persons convicted of sex offences may be held in all closed institutions and at present the majority are held in Arbour Hill Prison, Wheatfield Place of Detention, Castlerea Prison, to which Deputy Higgins refers, and the Curragh Place of Detention. Individual counselling is available in all of the institutions. Counselling is also provided by my Department's clinical psychology service and the <Col N="164" /> probation and welfare service. In addition there is a dedicated treatment programme in operation in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree he is telling us that no treatment is better than some treatment and that, because treatment cannot be provided by the State, it is better to leave a prisoner without that treatment?

It must be remembered in the issue of treatment that two criteria must be met: the individual must be suitable for treatment and must volunteer for treatment. The information available to me is that compulsory treatment is not the way to proceed. It does not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Work on amending and expanding the Children Bill, 1996, which deals primarily with juvenile justice, is almost complete and the greater part of it has been forwarded to the parliamentary draftsman's office for drafting. Because of the number of changes to the Bill, it would be difficult, if not well nigh impossible, to process it through Committee Stage. Accordingly, the parliamentary draftsman has been asked to proceed on the basis that a new Bill will be required and, as soon as the drafting has been completed, I intend to ask the Government for approval to publish the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1998 the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, visited New Zealand and while there took the opportunity to study at first hand its juvenile justice system, which has a reputation for being innovative and successful. He was particularly interested in the New Zealand system of family group conferencing, both for children <Col N="165" /> who have committed offences and children who may be in need of care or protection. It is generally accepted the New Zealand system cannot be transported to other countries but the Minister of State considered it worth undertaking a total examination of our system in the light of the New Zealand experience to identify the extent to which the ideas underpinning the New Zealand system might be adapted for use in Ireland. Accordingly, proposals for inclusion in the new Bill which I intend to bring to Government will reflect the outcome of that examination. The proposals will, in the main, be concentrated on the use of conferencing as a preventative measure dealing primarily with children at risk and on expanding the existing family conferencing provisions in the present Bill to include a role for the court.</P>
    <P>There have also been major developments, not only in New Zealand but internationally, on the relatively new system of restorative justice. The Bill will seek to reflect that development also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a definitive answer to the question I asked him &ndash; will he confirm that the Government will produce a new juvenile justice Bill, as the Tánaiste clearly stated before the Easter recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the immortal words of Shakespeare, &ldquo; a rose by any other name would smell as sweet&rdquo;. The reality is that the legislation which will be produced, whether under the guise of the old legislation or of a totally new Bill, will be new legislation. The reason for that is there have been developments internationally on the issue of juvenile justice and legislation must reflect that.</P>
      <P>The delay is not impeding the provision of juvenile justice services. The legislation will be the blueprint for the development of a juvenile justice system for decades to come. It is important that we get it right. The Bill has undergone a fundamental re-examination and analysis. If I was to proceed by way of amendment, we would be dealing with between 200 and 300 amendments. The Bill had 230 sections and I will be adding 50 sections to it.</P>

The position, as I understand it, is that the State is in receipt of legal advice in respect of its position on the case, and that would include any question of damages. Furthermore, to raise such a matter in public before the arbitration procedure has been concluded, especially as regards possible damages involved, could adversely compromise the State's position and give rise to higher damages. There is clearly a problem in devolving information about the case as the agreement on arbitration contains a confidentiality clause.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that certain protections concerning security of tenure already exist within the landlord and tenant code and these protections are consistent with the need to balance the rights of individual parties under the Constitution. The issues are the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>In recent times, the issue of security of tenure must be seen against the background of general developments in the housing market. The second Bacon report, entitled The Housing Market: An Economic Review and Assessment, recommended that landlord and tenant legislation be reviewed to address possible barriers to investment in the private rented sector and the issue of an appropriate balance of rights between landlords and tenants. In response to the report, the Government announced on 9 March 1999 that it had decided, in principle, to establish a commission to examine issues relating to the security of tenure in the private rented sector. The arrangements for the establishment of the commission are being examined by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the Government decision on the commission, I am of the view that the introduction <Col N="170" /> of legislation at this time would be unwise. The proposals for legislative changes which emerge from the commission will be a matter for consideration in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept his reply is of little comfort to tenants facing eviction, those who have been evicted and those facing huge rent increases? Does he accept all Members, particularly those who represent urban constituencies, are faced with a crisis? His reply does not acknowledge the urgency of the matter. Is this a constitutional problem? Will the Minister outline his understanding of the constitutional problem? Is he aware that Threshold has stated there is no constitutional impediment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no court cases if lawyers did not differ in their opinions. The Deputy asked if it was time for a constitutional referendum. I will have to await the outcome of the commission's work before saying there could be a less drastic solution than a constitutional referendum regarding tenure.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult and complex area. The right to private property is enshrined in the Constitution and there have been various interpretations of what that means. I would prefer to await the commission's report. There is a difficulty regarding tenure.</P>

      <P>The Government intends to address this important matter. There is ongoing liaison between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government concerning landlord and tenant issues, including the important issue of security of tenure raised by Deputy Gormley. A range of matters impact on the private rented sector, many of which are rooted in recent developments in the housing market. In its response to the Bacon report, the Government indicated that it is prepared to take the initiatives needed to address existing problems. The policy response to problems in the private rented sector must come from a variety of sources and draw various strands together. The commission is ideally placed to do this.</P>

    <Title>Sheedy Case Representations: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate at the outset, for reasons I will outline, that separate representations received by me at different times from each of the parties in the Sheedy case, and passed on by my office to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have no relevance whatsoever to the circumstances surrounding the premature release in the Circuit Court of Philip Sheedy last November. It is important that we all keep a sense of proportion and not treat an incidental detail that is essentially immaterial as if it were a vital link in the chain.</P>
      <P>Mr. Philip Sheedy, it will be recalled, was sentenced to be imprisoned for four years on 20 October 1997 in the Circuit Criminal Court, having been convicted of dangerous driving causing death while under the excessive influence of alcohol. On foot of representations made to another member of the Judiciary, a review was reinstated and the sentence was reviewed a year later by the judge who should have sat in the case originally, but did not. Early release was ordered by him in unusual circumstances, for reasons that have not yet been totally clarified but which have no political connection. When the release came to the notice of the family of the victim, strong representations were made and, following an official inquiry, the Chief Justice was very critical of the handling of the case by two of the judges involved, both of whom subsequently resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was brought to my attention by my private secretary on 12 April that I had made an inquiry on 9 July 1998 as to whether it would be possible for Mr. Sheedy to get day release. Although I did not immediately recall at the time what way the matter had been brought up, I have now established that the inquiry was made by the father of Mr. Sheedy, neither of whom I knew, in seeking day release for his son for one or two days a week <Col N="181" /> to attend a training course on projects of benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>Some of the comment has blurred the distinction between &ldquo;release&rdquo; and &ldquo;day release&rdquo;, which are quite separate issues. I wish to point out that &ldquo;day release&rdquo; has no bearing on the length of the sentence to be served but merely concerns the conditions under which the sentence is served. I emphasise that no representations or inquiries were made by me or my office as to whether Philip Sheedy could be released early, which was the issue in the judges' handling of the case.</P>
    <P>I should, however, state that Mr. Sheedy senior enclosed with his letter proposals drawn up by an instructor in FÁS to expand and modify the general programme of day release, in a way that after a certain period day release would have become equivalent to actual release on part-time community work as an alternative to prison. When instructing my private secretary, I left this proposal to one side as I probably considered it a longer-term policy matter which, perhaps, Mr. Sheedy thought could benefit his son, as well as enabling him to give something back to the community. After an extensive search I have now found the letter that Mr. Sheedy senior sent to me, which, with his permission, I will now read into the record of the House. The letter is undated, but the manuscript note given to my private secretary was dated 9 July 1998. The letter reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Ahern,</P>
    <P>My son Philip is presently serving a four year sentence in Shelton Abbey, Arklow, Co. Wicklow, having received the sentence on a Death by Dangerous Driving charge. To date he has served 9 months.</P>
    <P>The reason for my making this representation to you in your capacity as Taoiseach, you may be in a position to recommend Philip for the day release work programme currently operating in our prison system for the rehabilitation of prisoners. I believe through my employment with FÁS and its involvement with community work groups that there is a lot of projects in which he could use his architectural skills in the community around the Arklow area on a day release, say one or two days per week &ndash;  projects where he would be involved in designing, supervising and advising on community skills or special buildings for the elderly. Prior to his accident he had been involved as a volunteer worker in designing special buildings for the elderly in Summerhill, County Meath. His services would benefit the Arklow community and also keep his work skills fresh and active.</P>
    <P>I enclose a copy of a proposal programme which has been designed by Tony McAvinney &ldquo;an inspiring instructor&rdquo; in the FÁS town centre in Tallaght. This programme, with the title Offenders Community Employment Programme, is envisaged to save up to £1 million <Col N="182" /> per annum on the basis of a recent newspaper report which gives a figure of the average cost of a prisoner in our prisons at £45,000. If this programme was implemented I would gladly take leave of absence from my position in FÁS and work for the Department of Justice in the setting up, co-ordination and supervision of the pilot project. My work in the setting up of FÁS work schemes in the Tallaght area over the last nineteen years would make this task very simple and I would guarantee very successful.</P>
    <P>The programme would differ from the present community services programme in that the offender will serve at least six months in prison and the remainder of his sentence on a particular single project as part of a team.</P>
    <P>The reason again for writing this simple representation to you is that Philip through the day release programme currently in operation would find some gain from helping the community and paying back to society the benefit of his work skills.</P>
    <P>If the above is not possible I will understand and I thank you for finding the time to read this request.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Philip Sheedy Senior.</P>
    <P>The implication that I took from the last paragraph was that if nothing could be done, no reply was needed.</P>
    <P>My then private secretary, who served my predecessor as Taoiseach as well as myself and who acted correctly in this matter, spoke by telephone to the private secretary to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the basis of my handwritten note. The inquiry was confined to the possibility of day release as it operates at present. There was nothing covert about the query. The details were registered on computer. The instruction to my private secretary, as noted by him, was simply &ldquo;Justice &ndash; What is the story?&rdquo;  I did not make a recommendation, as perhaps Mr. Sheedy senior would have liked me to have done, nor was the inquiry, strictly speaking, made or addressed to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It has been confirmed to me that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform treated it, as intended, as a routine inquiry. The Minister did not see it. Numerous inquiries are addressed to him relating to all manner of cases by Deputies from all sides of the House and by priests and social workers. Routine inquiries of all kinds are made all the time between respective ministerial private offices on behalf of Ministers or the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, as we know, people who are released early go on to commit repeat offences. However, my inquiry was not a recommendation or request for early release. It was concerned only with the possibility of day release. I was not aware of any approaches the Sheedy family made to anyone else but it is not unusual for more than one public representative, often from different <Col N="183" /> parties, or others in positions of authority to be approached about the same matter. I was not aware of Mr. Joe Burke's visit to Mr. Sheedy in Shelton Abbey.</P>
    <P>The oral reply my office subsequently received was that day release was not possible because it would be too early in the sentence and that there was a scheduled review in October 1999. There was nothing on the file that would have shown the review date had, at that time, been removed.</P>
    <P>When a negative response was received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I dropped the matter and did not pursue it further. I accepted, without question, the Department's view on the matter. I did not press the case in any way, even though the Minister has powers to order the early release of convicted persons.</P>
    <P>To sum up, my office made a routine inquiry about the possibility of day release only. It received a negative response. The matter was left there. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that the answer to numerous requests for concessions of one kind or another from Mr. Sheedy was always &ldquo;no&rdquo;, so it is nonsense to suggest that the Government showed any special sympathy to Mr. Sheedy.</P>
    <P>The issue in the Sheedy case was whether judges in the light of their duties acted properly. The Chief Justice expressed a critical opinion on that. I, in the performance of my duties, acted with complete propriety in relation to the representations received. I or, more accurately, my office acting on my behalf did only the minimum of what any Deputy does in the circumstances &ndash; pass on the inquiry, note the response and, if at any point there is a development, pass it back to the inquirer. I would have done the same for any constituent or citizen, regardless of his or her social or political background. I applied no political pressure to get Mr. Sheedy early release.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that I received a letter from John Ryan on 15 February last, whose wife Anne was tragically killed in the road accident. He explained the deep sense of betrayal by the legal system which he and his family felt at the early release of Mr. Sheedy. He asked me for any assistance I could give to remedy the situation. The letter was immediately acknowledged and I referred it to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on 16 February with a request for material for a reply.</P>
    <P>In the event, the pace of developments made it difficult to issue any early substantive reply. My private secretary contacted Mr. Ryan by phone on 12 April to apologise for the delay in replying to him and to explain that a reply would be given to him as soon as the Hamilton report was received. Following receipt of the report, I contacted Mr. Ryan by telephone on 16 April and we discussed the conclusions reached by the Chief Justice. I also replied in writing to him on the following day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> The Government treated this entire matter involving members of the Judiciary with the utmost seriousness and without fear or favour towards any of those involved. It should be overwhelmingly obvious that the Government did not seek at any stage to protect Mr. Sheedy from facing the full consequences of his offence. Appeals to shorten sentences actually served, even in the case of equally serious crimes, are regularly received from Deputies, but there was no such appeal made by me.</P>
    <P>I and my general office have a large casework, apart from the conduct of Government which has to be my principal concern. When I came back from the Easter break on 12 April, I was reminded that I had made a representation by my private secretary who, in turn, had been alerted by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which had confirmed that it had a note on its file to inform the Taoiseach of any developments in the case. My private secretary first heard the suggestion that there could be something on file on 1 April when we were in Hillsborough Castle, the Thursday before Easter. Nevertheless, I informed the Tánaiste about the matter in the following couple of days and the Cabinet by the end of the week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Taoiseach said yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The original routine inquiry had no connection with the subsequent handling of the case in the courts. I state categorically, to avoid all misunderstanding, that I made no representations, direct or indirect, to any member of the Judiciary in relation to the case and I did not ask anybody about early release. It is clear that at no stage before the handling of the case in the courts became a matter of State in February of this year did I regard the case, although it was tragic and unfortunate from everyone's point of view, as one deserving or needing any special priority from me.</P>
      <P>It was always my intention to put the information in the public domain as soon as I had a suitable opportunity to do so. The issue was not so much one of not being asked the right question as not being able to find an obvious suitable opening in reply to supplementary questions about the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in which I could have reasonably inserted the information, as I had firmly intended and as I had a discussed with the Tánaiste. I had a note with me for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all been in situations where we intended, or even agreed, to say something but failed to do so because we could not find the right opportunity. At least 15 minutes of Taoiseach's questions last Wednesday were taken up by technical argument between Deputies and the Chair. However, as I acknowledged in my statement yesterday evening, I accept that I should, nonethe<Col N="185" /> less, have found some way, however artificial, of doing what I had originally undertaken to do.</P>
    <P>More generally, the problem with an unsolicited parliamentary statement is the implication that as a procedure it is used normally when one has done something wrong or by way of correction to the official record. There is an understandable and legitimate concern not to feed conspiracy theories or, by juxtaposing irrelevant information, to imply or signal the probability of some hidden connection. As he has already publicly stated, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not include the information in his statement to the Dáil for precisely those reasons. He felt it would distract attention from the main issue, to which it was not relevant, and I agreed with that judgment. No disrespect to the House is intended by me or any of my colleagues. I believe this Government has always tried to be open with the House in regard to providing all the information necessary to form a judgment in any controversy.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciated, nevertheless, that it was necessary to put the information on the public record, and sooner rather than later. I did not get a good opening to mention the matter in the Dáil as I had hoped at Question Time last week, but equally I accept I was remiss in not finding some way of doing so. I let the matter be widely known and gave full information when requested to a journalist from the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> Again, I accept this was not a satisfactory way of doing things.</P>
    <P>This is a minority coalition Government which is working extremely well in conditions that demand unprecedented openness, transparency and accountability. I answer questions and points on the Order of Business and am accessible to the media in a way that bears favourable comparison with most of my predecessors, some of whom have been more adept at limiting their public appearances, interviews and answers to questions than I have been. My inclination is always to be helpful to those whom I encounter and that may sometimes be a failing. I work closely with the Tánaiste, consult with her and do my best to keep her informed and we all seek to act in concert.</P>
    <P>However, there are continuous attempts in this House on more than one matter to undermine public trust in my political integrity, which is a separate issue. I am sorry for that but there is no want of honest intent on my part always to try to do the right thing. I will be ready when the time comes to put the record of an honest and conscientious Administration that did its best before the people. No matter what slant is put on it, I do not fear their verdict on me or my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no easy way to say this. This debate has been forced on the House because all the contradictions have led many in the House to question whether it has a truthful Taoiseach. If the Taoiseach is not believed to be truthful by the Tánaiste, Government cannot work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> The Sheedy case reveals the existence of a circle of friends, a chain of personal relationships from Philip Sheedy through Joe Burke to the Taoiseach, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty and Mr. Cyril Kelly, which links business, politics and the law. This circle of friends can be all too easily manipulated by people who have no sense of restraint.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Taoiseach and Dáil Éireann and between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste reveals a pattern of demonstrably untruthful statements, evasions and concealments which is destructive of all trust. I remind the House of a statement made here by the Taoiseach less than a year ago, on 28 May 1998: </P>
    <P>I have never concealed information or been economical with the truth. I ask my colleagues to accept that. It is simply not in my nature to do that, certainly not on this issue.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Taoiseach was speaking about the Rennicks controversy. His behaviour in that and a series of other issues has been in direct contradiction of that statement.</P>
    <P>This latest example of the Taoiseach's deliberate concealment of information from the public, the Dáil and his Coalition partners fits into a pattern of behaviour which stretches back to before he was elected Taoiseach by this House. When the Taoiseach was considering the formation of his Government, he was aware of the serious rumours about the then Deputy Ray Burke. After he had appointed Mr. Burke as a Minister, the Taoiseach assured us he had conducted rigorous investigations into these allegations, even to the extent that he had &ldquo;looked up every tree in North Dublin&rdquo;. It was only several months later that we discovered the truth. The inquiries, if one could call them that, carried out by the Taoiseach were so casual and superficial they were tantamount to a cover up. We can be sure the Tánaiste was not told of the true nature of the investigation because she subsequently said she agreed to Mr. Burke's appointment to Government on the basis of assurances given by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>This is not the only issue relating to Mr. Burke about which the Taoiseach has been found to be hiding the true facts. In May 1998 it was disclosed in <i>Magill </i> that former Minister Burke had received a substantial donation from Rennicks, £10,000 of which had been passed on to Fianna Fáil. Despite knowing about this donation and that Mr. Burke had misled the Dáil, the Taoiseach did not see fit to come into the House to correct the record. Only in responding to an order of discovery by the Flood Tribunal did Fianna Fáil acknowledge receiving £10,000 from Rennicks, although it knew the donation to Mr. Burke was £30,000. The Taoiseach had at least three months in which he had countless opportunities to come clean with the Dáil and the Tánaiste on what he knew about this issue, but he chose not to do so. Having received a yellow card from the Tánaiste on that occasion, one might have expected the Taoiseach to be more <Col N="187" /> careful in his behaviour in future. However, he was not.</P>
    <P>In December 1998 the taxpayers were shocked to discover that the tax assessment of £2 million levied on the Taoiseach's mentor, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, had been reduced to zero by an Appeals Commissioner. What the Taoiseach failed to volunteer until it was specifically put to him in the Dáil was that the Appeals Commissioner in question was his brother-in-law, appointed by him when he was still Minister for Finance following the general election in 1992. To add insult to injury, the Taoiseach told the Tánaiste that the other Appeals Commissioner appointed on that occasion was nominated by the Labour Party, which turned out to be totally false. Again in this case we saw that the Taoiseach only releases potentially embarrassing information when he is forced to do so.</P>
    <P>If we thought the Taoiseach had learned his lesson after this debacle, then we were sadly mistaken. Just one month later we saw the spectacle of his changing recollections of his contacts with Mr. Tom Gilmartin, who alleges that he gave a donation of £50,000, intended for Fianna Fáil, to the then Minister Pádraig Flynn in 1989. As the Taoiseach was questioned about his own contacts with Mr. Gilmartin, he changed his story on no fewer than five occasions in five days.</P>
    <P>The result of this constantly changing story by the Taoiseach was that Mr. Gilmartin's account appeared to be far more credible than that of the Taoiseach. When it came to investigating the substance of Mr. Gilmartin's allegation, the Taoiseach adopted his usual investigative tactics and did practically nothing other than send a polite letter, almost begging not to be replied to, to Commissioner Flynn. Again in this case the Taoiseach failed to inform the Tánaiste of what he knew about this donation and the fact he had a number of contacts with the donor at or around the time of the donation to Mr. Flynn for Fianna Fáil. This time we were told the Progressive Democrats were only giving the Government what they called conditional support.</P>
    <P>The next act in this drama came in February of this year when we discovered that Fianna Fáil had received a donation from a person who was an applicant for an Irish passport. In this instance we had the added element of &ldquo;sources close to the Taoiseach&rdquo; giving deliberately misleading information to the media and especially to a particular journalist. The truth of this affair, that £10,000 had been diverted from an account of the passport applicant to Fianna Fáil and not repaid, had to be dragged from the Taoiseach and his associates as the Tánaiste and her party again looked on in bewilderment.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the contractions and inconsistencies in the accounts of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of their dealings with the Sheedy case. There are many questions to be answered. On 10 February the Attorney General notified the Minister for Jus<Col N="188" /> tice, Equality and Law Reform in Berlin about a query on the Sheedy case. On 11 February the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform ordered a departmental investigation into the matter.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Attorney General tell the Taoiseach at this time that an inquiry had begun? If so, did the Taoiseach recall or tell either man that he had made representations in this case? Were the files in the Taoiseach's office checked at that time and, if not, why not? Were the files on Mr. Sheedy in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform checked at that time and, if not, why not? If the files were checked, did they not disclose the existence of representations from the Taoiseach on this matter? If so, were they disclosed to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, if not, why not? </P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform insists he was not told of the note on the file regarding the Taoiseach's representations until early April. How are we to believe that? Did the note on that file state that the Taoiseach's office should be alerted if there was a development in the case? If so, was the Taoiseach's office notified that Sheedy was released in November 1998 and, if so, what action was taken on receiving that information? The House would like to know what official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had custody of that file. Did that official tell the private secretary to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    <P>Did the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Tim Dalton, know that the Taoiseach had made representations in the Sheedy case? Did the Secretary General notify the Minister of his knowledge of this matter? If the Secretary General knew, what account can he give for his failure to tell either the Minister or the Taoiseach of his knowledge of representations in a case that was so important it necessitated the Attorney General ringing the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Berlin? </P>
    <P>Can the House see the file on the Sheedy case? Are the Taoiseach, the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform willing to make available to the House the full file with all its annotations and records of where that file has been? Is the Taoiseach willing to give the House his Department's file on this case? Is there a file in the Minister's office in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform separate from the file in the prisons section? Can we have that file too?</P>
    <P>There is a gap of more than six weeks between when the investigation was initiated in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claims the representation by the Taoiseach was brought to his attention, namely, in early April. What official had custody of the <Col N="189" /> file during that very lengthy period? That official has to account for himself or herself if he or she failed to tell the Taoiseach of the matter, particularly if there was a note on the file requiring that the Taoiseach should be informed. That official needs to give an explanation.</P>
    <P>On 1 April the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his speech gave a commitment to inform the House of the circumstances in which this case came to his notice and that of his Department, and to outline the action he took in the matter. Did he actually inform the House of all he knew on 1 April? Did he know on 1 April of the Taoiseach's representation when speaking in the House? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that he became aware of the Taoiseach's representation for the first time at the beginning of April. The beginning of April is 1 April. When he spoke in the House on 1 April did he know of the Taoiseach's representation and, if so, why did he not tell the Taoiseach? </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday he was reminded of his representation on 12 April by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He is now telling the House that he became aware of this on 1 April. Even between yesterday and today there is a change in the Taoiseach's recall. He said his private secretary was told about the matter in Hillsborough on 1 April. I presume his private secretary told him about it at that time. If he did, why did the Taoiseach issue a statement yesterday suggesting the first day on which he knew about it was 12 April? Has the story changed again overnight?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The first day I heard about it was 12 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Taoiseach is stating his private secretary did not tell him of what he was informed on 1 April. He did not think it was material even though it was a matter that was being debated in the House on 1 April; a matter that was calling for a special debate in the House. The Taoiseach said he was not informed for 12 days by his private secretary of a matter of that political importance. The Taoiseach might have answered in his speech if he had an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What version are we to believe? If the version of the officials came in the week beginning Tuesday, 6 April, was the Tánaiste denied this information? Did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform know what his private secretary was told on 1 April in Hillsborough? If the Taoiseach's private secretary was <Col N="190" /> told on 1 April in Hillsborough about the Taoiseach's representations at the same time as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was speaking in this House and not telling the House of it, was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told before he spoke? Why did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not put that material matter before the House given that he said in the House he would be giving a full account, not only of his own work but the work of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the matter? Is it not the case that Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because of the revelation that his office informed the Taoiseach's office on 1 April of the Taoiseach's representation is now being made out as having that information but not telling the House? Is it not the case that in effect the Taoiseach is making the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform out to be somebody who concealed something he knew from the House? Is that loyalty or is it just the truth?</P>
      <P>Whatever the truth about the exact timing of the reminder to the Taoiseach it is absolutely clear that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform thereafter contrived to keep this information hidden. I am not saying this on my own authority. We have had this confirmed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his interview of this week, Sunday 2 May, when he said: &ldquo;may I make it perfectly clear the reason why the information was not available was because of the fact that it was not relevant to the case and I felt it would come out as appropriate&rdquo;. Here we have a further contradiction &ndash; this time between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Taoiseach said he was searching frantically for a way to make this information available and yet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last Sunday he wanted to make sure it was not made available because it was not relevant and he did not want to give fodder to conspiracy theorists.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform admitted he was trying to keep the information out of the public domain and the Taoiseach said he was trying to put it into the public domain. Which of these versions is true?</P>

      <P>I have much more to say. I understand the Taoiseach has indicated there will not be any restraint on speeches. That is part of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part I believe the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was telling the truth even though the truth in this case does him little credit. The press officer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Noel Waters, denied to two journalists last week that any representations had been made for the day release of Philip Sheedy. Was this official denied infor<Col N="191" /> mation or was he instructed to deny that representations were being made? Will Mr. Waters make a public statement of his role in this matter and what he was told?</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said on the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme, Sunday, 2 May, that the Taoiseach had mentioned the matter to various people including a journalist on the fringes of the IMI conference in Killarney on Friday, 22 April. According to media reports on Sunday, 18 April, the Taoiseach told journalist Mark O'Connell in a pub in Glasnevin that he had, according to O'Connell, received an approach from Philip Sheedy's father who had worked in a FÁS centre in his constituency, and that he had referred the matter to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, because it was a law and order issue and related to someone in custody. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, had refused the release that Philip Sheedy's father had been seeking on behalf of his son. On Tuesday, 20 April, there were statements in the House on the Chief Justice's report and on the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had an opportunity to tell the House about the Taoiseach's representation then but he did not do so.</P>

      <P>About a minute and half may be sufficient. That will ease the issue for all concerned. I wish to address one intriguing part of the relationship between Mr. Joe Burke and the Taoiseach. In the <i>Irish Independent </i>of 26 April Mr. Burke is quoted as saying the Taoiseach knew nothing about this case beforehand. He did not know anything about it until all this happened. It has nothing to do with the Taoiseach. Before being in a position to make such a definitive assertion to the media, Mr. Burke must have <Col N="192" /> raised this matter with his friend, the Taoiseach. Did the Taoiseach not tell Mr. Burke he had made a representation about this case last year? Is his attachment for concealment and evasion so strong that he even concealed this from Mr. Joe Burke? </P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if the findings of the Hamilton report and his Department's report on Mr. Cyril Kelly's actions in seeking to alter a court file have been referred to the Garda for further action, a decision which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform report said should be a decision for the Government? Has the Government so decided? If not, why not? Will that court case take place.</P>
      <P>There is one word which sums up the dilemma the House faces over the Sheedy affair. That word is &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Why did Mr. Cyril Kelly do what he did? Why did the Taoiseach do what he did, forget what he did, and conceal what he did? Why did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not look for explanations from Mr. Justice Kelly before awarding him a large <i>ex gratia </i>pension? Why did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not want explanations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The political crisis that developed over the past 24 hours which brought the Government yet again to the brink of disintegration was entirely of the Taoiseach's making. His conduct has been, at best, dishonest and evasive and, at worst, untruthful and contemptuous of the Dáil. One aspect is clear &ndash; the Taoiseach has acted in a manner unworthy of his office. He withheld from the Dáil information in his possession on a matter so significant that it has already led to the resignation of a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and the Dublin County Registrar.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave an undertaking to the Tánaiste that he would place the information before the Dáil and he failed to do so. He has given a series of accounts on the origins of his representations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the Sheedy case which are inconsistent and contradictory. He was dismissive of the Dáil and contemptuous of the right of the public and Deputies to know the facts. Over the weekend, the Taoiseach gave an account of his conversation with the Tánaiste which he was subsequently forced to admit was untruthful. In a last desperate attempt to prevent his Government foundering on the rocks, he was forced to issue a humiliating and abject apology to the Tánaiste.</P>

    <P>Following these events, the political reputation and integrity of the Taoiseach is in tatters. The cohesion and stability of the Government has yet again been stretched to breaking point. We know from our recent political history that coalition Government only works well when there is total trust between the parties involved. We have had coalition Governments in the past in which there has been trust and solidarity and which have <Col N="193" /> worked well. We have had coalition Governments which were destroyed by distrust and dishonesty. On this occasion, the cracks appear to have been temporarily papered over. Few Members on either side do not believe that the damage done by this affair will prove terminal to the life of the Government.</P>
    <P>If the matter of the Taoiseach's non-disclosure of his involvement in making representations on behalf of Mr. Philip Sheedy had been a single incident, it might not have been so damaging. However, as the Tánaiste knows, this is just the latest in a growing list of problems and crises which have arisen or been greatly intensified by the failure of the Taoiseach to be honest and open with the Tánaiste and the public. As one commentator said this morning, the Taoiseach is acting in a manner consistently like other Fianna Fáil leaders, like a man with a brick outside a jeweller's window. The Tánaiste has on more than one occasion been led up the garden path by the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It took an act of brinkmanship to get the apology and the Tánaiste is surely running out of lives.</P>
      <P>The core issue of the current controversy is not that the Taoiseach made representations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of Mr. Sheedy, although there are some questionable features about the manner of the representations to which I will return later. The core issue is that the Taoiseach deliberately and calculatedly withheld this information from the Dáil after he was reminded of it by his Department, had discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and had given an undertaking to the Tánaiste that he would give the information.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's claim that he, as a Member with at least 20 years experience in the House, did not have an adequate opportunity to place the information before the Dáil defies belief. His claim that he tried to put the information into the public domain through a chat in a public house or through a casual conversation with a financial journalist on the fringes of an IMI conference defies belief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been a Member of the House for a long time. He knows the pro<Col N="194" /> cedures of the House and that the Taoiseach in possession in the House in terms of Standing Orders and parliamentary Question Time has ample opportunity to give additional information. He had the ideal opportunity to put the information before the Dáil last week in line with the Tánaiste's request.</P>
      <P>As my colleague Deputy Howlin outlined on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, the Taoiseach had a brief conversation with him prior to Question Time in which he invited Deputy Howlin to ask questions about Chief Justice Hamilton's statement that day. If the Taoiseach wanted his own involvement ventilated, as he has protested, why did he not invite another question as he had the opportunity to do? At any stage the Taoiseach could have exercised the option available to him under Standing Order 42 of the rules of House which states: &ldquo;A member of the Government who has given prior notice to the Ceann Comhairle may make a statement in the House on any matter.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach chose not to do so.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are also at odds on whether they agreed that the information would be put into the public domain. According to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, a decision was made not to put the information out because it would be used as fodder by conspiracy theorists. The Taoiseach claims it was agreed to put the matter into the public domain and to back this up he refers to his conversations with two journalists. Who is telling the truth, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who I understand is in the Seanad at present?</P>
      <P>As with the judicial aspects of the Sheedy affair, I fear that we have yet to get anything like a full account of the political involvement in this case. For example, the origins of the Taoiseach's involvement in this case are still far from clear. Last Saturday, he told the<i> Sunday Tribune</i> that he was not sure who made representations to him, suggesting that he may have received a letter from Mr. Sheedy senior. On Sunday, the Taoiseach told reporters he &ldquo;believed&rdquo; he had received a letter from Mr. Sheedy senior and by Monday he said that he had received &ldquo;a nice letter&rdquo; from Mr. Sheedy senior. Strangely, no trace of this letter could be found. Now, the Taoiseach has found it and has put its contents on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>Was the letter sent to his constituency office in Drumcondra? If so, why was it referred to his private secretary and not to his constituency office in the Department of the Taoiseach which is staffed by a combination of civil servants and political appointees made by the Taoiseach? I do not suggest that a Minister or a Taoiseach would never refer such a matter to his private secretary. However, the more usual procedure is for such matters to be dealt with by the constituency office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach receives dozens if not hundreds of representations about various cases <Col N="195" /> each week. How many of them are dealt with by his private secretary who is a relatively high ranking civil servant in his Department? Was this case referred to his private secretary because it was regarded as being particularly important or sensitive or because of who might have first raised it with the Taoiseach? We are left to wonder, and the Taoiseach did not address that aspect of the matter in his statement. We now know the contents of the letter. To which address was it sent? Who dealt with it? No doubt we will be in a position to pursue these matters later.</P>
    <P>If the letter was such a routine inquiry as the Taoiseach suggested, why was a note attached to the file in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the effect that the Taoiseach should be updated on any developments in the case? Why was this note not acted upon in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Why was the matter only drawn to the attention of the Taoiseach by his private secretary in April? Surely there was a record of the Taoiseach's representations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his own Department? How did the Taoiseach's current private secretary come to know about the original telephone call given that the civil servant holding that office had moved since the matter was originally raised with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also has questions to answer. His performance has deteriorated from incapable and ill-informed to bumbling and inept. Of all the statements made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the past few weeks, the one that asks the public and Members to suspend credulity is that made on Radio Kerry yesterday when he claimed never to have even read the Sheedy file, even at the time when this was a matter of raging public and political controversy in April. There are current office holders, a few aspiring ones on that side of the House and some ex-office holders on this side of the House, and the idea that a controversy that led subsequently to the resignation or near impeachment of a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and a county registrar was of such indifference to the relevant Minister that he never read the file simply beggars belief. If it is true, he should be fired and gone by the end of the day and somebody should take his place. That seems incredible.</P>

      <P>Not that far, I will take that back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue must also account for the way journalists were given inaccurate answers to questions put to his Department. Two journalists put specific questions to the Department's spokesperson asking simply and directly if representations had been made to get early release for Mr. Philip Sheedy by anyone at any stage. The answer given to both journalists <Col N="196" /> was a direct negative. The official concerned is a long serving and reputable civil servant. I cannot believe such an experienced official would take it on himself to answer the question without having satisfied himself that he was in possession of the appropriate information. Could the official have been misled in giving inaccurate information to these two journalists? If so, who made this decision? Regardless of who made such a decision, political responsibility for a Department issuing false information rests directly and solely with the Minister. The public and the Dáil are entitled to answers, but there is no sign we will get them from this Government. The snarling, petulant and intolerant figure we saw on our television screens on Monday night, dismissive of the Dáil and contemptuous of the public's right to know, is an image of the Taoiseach that we have not often seen before but, sadly, that is becoming a more regular feature.</P>
    <P>Many things are not as they seem. Many of us thought we knew the basic facts about Mr. Raphael Burke's appointment to the Government in 1997, but as events unfold at the Flood Tribunal, including this morning's dramatic revelations, it is clear we did not know the half of it. Many more than we thought figure, including the Tánaiste, will have to answer publicly about their knowledge of matters relating to Mr. Burke's appointment. Today's disclosures at Dublin Castle may hold some clues as to why the Tánaiste decided to make a stand on this issue, having been so understanding of the Taoiseach's shortcomings in the life of the Government so far.</P>
    <P>As I said at the Labour Party conference at the weekend, if politics and public life is to regain respect, it must not only be clean but be seen to be clean. Cleaning up politics not only requires an end to the unhealthy interdependence that has developed between politics and big business, it also means the public can be reassured that financial wealth, judicial contacts or political influence will result in one person receiving more privileged treatment from the courts than another. It requires that should a husband have his wife and mother of his two young children taken from him in the cruellest of circumstances, the person responsible will be dealt with firmly and fairly by the judicial system.</P>

      <P>Has any other member of the Government made representations on behalf of Mr. Philip Sheedy? Will the Taoiseach outline any discussions, informal or otherwise, he has had with Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly in the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas there had been a number of requests on the file, there was none from any other member of the Government. The record will show that on 20 October 1997, Mr. Philip Sheedy was committed to Mountjoy Prison; on 21 October 1997 he was transferred to the training unit; in December 1997, he was refused Christmas temporary release; in January 1998, he <Col N="197" /> was refused temporary release for his father's birthday; on 26 March 1998, he applied for transfer to Shelton Abbey, which was refused; on 2 April 1998 he was refused transfer to Shelton Abbey; on 8 April 1998, he was refused Easter temporary release; on 8 April 1998 he was cleared for Shelton Abbey and on 11 April 1998 he was transferred. In August 1998, he was refused temporary release for a wedding on 5 September and on 3 September he was approved accompanied temporary release with a chaplain for the funeral of his partner's mother. On 12 November 1998, he was released. There is no record of any other political figure. I presume Deputy Bruton is asking me if I had informal discussions with former Mr. Justices O'Flaherty and Kelly on this matter or generally.</P>

I have no recollection of meeting him on any other occasion. I met the former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty on at least three occasions in the past year that I recollect. I met him about a week before Christmas when he acted in the capacity of organiser of the function for the commemoration of the 1798 Memorial in the Supreme Court. I met him after the religious service for 1798 in St Michim's Parish Church and at the reception afterwards at which he spoke. I also met him on one other occasion during the 1998 commemorations and I do not believe I spoke to him on that occasion.</P>

      <P>It was stated that the Taoiseach's private secretary first heard what the Taoiseach called the suggestion that there could be something on file in the form of representations from the Taoiseach about the Sheedy case on 1 April, when the Taoiseach and his private secretary were in Hillsborough Castle. Who informed his private secretary of this suggestion? Did his private secretary inform him on 1 April or at any time on 1, 2 or 3 April? Did the person who informed the Taoiseach's private secretary of this suggestion also inform the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before he came in to speak in this House? Has the Taoiseach ascertained whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was aware of the representations the Taoiseach had made when he spoke in the House on 1 April? If he was, will the Taoiseach tell us why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not inform the House of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of this matter is that some time during the night of 1 April 1998, when we were in Hillsborough, officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform mentioned to my private secretary <Col N="198" /> that there was some reference on the file which they would check and come back to him on it; they gave him no details whatsoever. We then had the Easter break and neither my private secretary nor I was in until 12 April. When I returned after a number of functions on the evening of 12 April, my private secretary informed me immediately of the information he had from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Deputy Quinn asked the same questions.  When my private secretary was informed by an official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it was at that stage we checked the register in the Department to see if we had any correspondence, and we both checked the register in my constituency office, which is separate. I checked the register in my Drumcondra office and in my general office and we found the computerised reference in the general office and found the note. When I came back that evening I was presented with my short, manuscript note, which I had obviously written from the letter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know where the letter went until today, when I asked my office to contact Mr. Sheedy senior to ask if I could use the letter sent to me, which I considered to be a private letter. It was only during the bank holiday weekend that I had a chance to search my records. When I get <Col N="199" /> letters I tend to write manuscript notes on the letter or on another paper and forward them.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sheedy worked in the FÁS centre in Cabra. He said he sent the letter to St. Luke's, Drumcondra, he did not call me, meet me or seek to meet me. I reckon I wrote the notes there, which I normally would do on letters received. In answer to Deputy Quinn, I did not send the letter to my constituency office because I always separate constituency cases from non-constituency cases, I have done that at least since I became a Minister. I get letters from all over the country and from abroad. The notes I took read:</P>

      <P>In his statement the Taoiseach mentioned he was not aware of the visit by Mr. Joe Burke to Shelton Abbey but, regardless of that, had he discussed the case with Mr. Burke before he received representations from Mr. Sheedy senior? When he made the representation, such as it was, was he aware the Sheedy family may have wished to seek Executive clemency for Mr. Philip Sheedy junior? When the Taoiseach received a reply from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, why did he not feel it necessary even to send a cursory note to say that he or the Department had looked at the matter? Even if a Deputy's representation is not successful or he has nothing of significance to report, does the Taoiseach accept it is normal that a letter of some kind is sent to clarify the matter? Why was that not done in this case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, I answer most letters but I receive an enormous number of them &ndash; particularly since I became Taoiseach but also when I was a Minister &ndash; which simply put a point of view and to which I would not reply. The end of Mr. Sheedy's letter reads:</P>
      <P>The reason again for writing this simple representation to you is that Philip, through the day release programme currently in operation, would find some gain from helping the community and paying back to society the benefit of his work skills.</P>

Can he explain the fingerprints to be found in the case before us, namely, those of two Fianna Fáil appointed judges, a Fianna Fáil Deputy, a former Fianna Fáil Deputy, a former Fianna Fáil councillor, who is a close friend of the Taoiseach, a Fianna Fáil Senator who sometimes doubles as a psychiatrist and, to cap it all, a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach? Does the Taoiseach accept that this matter is covered in Fianna Fáil's fingerprints and that ordinary people would be fully justified in believing that it was a Fianna Fáil job? What is his interpretation of this matter? When he contemplates all the evidence and facts which have emerged, does the Taoiseach draw the conclusion that, for whatever reason, this was a Fianna Fáil job to spring Mr. Sheedy?</P>

Of what was the Taoiseach thinking on Monday evening when he stated that the Tánaiste had not asked him to refer to this matter in the Dáil?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated earlier, I became aware of this matter on 12 April, I informed the Tánaiste about it on 14 April and I informed my Cabinet colleagues about it on 16 April at a meeting dedicated to discussing it. I was anxious to place this matter in the public domain and when I discussed it with the Tánaiste last Tuesday she <Col N="203" /> stated that I should make a statement to the House. I stated that questions were due to be taken that day in respect of the DPP and that I would take the opportunity to place it on record at that stage. However, the questions of the DPP did not arise until the following day. I intended to place it on record on the following day, Wednesday. That was the agreement I reached with the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>On Monday evening, on the steps of Government Buildings following a meeting with President Yasser Arafat, journalists put it to me that the Tánaiste had demanded that I make known my involvement in this matter.

      <P>I wish to inquire about the comportment of other members of the Cabinet. Most Members would be of the opinion that, even from the point of self-preservation and not to mention information to which the House is entitled, the minimum degree of political wisdom would suggest to anyone who had made representations in a matter of this sensitivity that they should inform the House of their actions at the earliest opportunity. When the Taoiseach informed his Cabinet colleagues &ndash; this goes to their political judgment &ndash; that he had made these representations, did any of them suggest that he should inform the House or were they unwilling to say something he might not want to hear? Alternatively, were they so dense that they could not see that the <Col N="204" /> House should be informed about the representations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I told my colleagues and, as stated previously by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there were very important and crucial issues about this case. My inquiry, which hardly amounted to a representation, did not rank very high on the list. I held the view it would be better to mention it. In hindsight the first day I saw it I should have marched in here and mentioned it, but it did not seem particularly important and at that stage I had not put all the bits together. Even though I had mentioned it to many people over the days from 16 to 27 April, some people are saying I told only one, two or three journalists. That is an irrelevant fact. I mentioned it to several people. There were at least a dozen people present during the discussion I had at the IMI. This was not something I was trying to hide, but in hindsight it would have been far better if I had come in here and probably made a special statement on it. Such a statement is normally made only if one has done something wrong or if one wants to correct the record and we did not see this matter in that light.</P>
      <P>Having thought about it, the Tánaiste and I agreed that I should put this matter on the record. Last Tuesday was the first time I answered questions on this matter in the House and that was an appropriate opportunity to mention this matter. Deputy Bruton may or may not believe me, but I hope he does believe me when I say we spent most of Question Time on a debate about the rights and wrongs of the DPP's office and the Deputy being able to ask questions in that regard. I rarely got an opportunity to intervene, but I should have mentioned it. I am not for one minute saying I should not have done so. That is what threw me on the day and I did not mention it. That was my intention. It was something I had agreed to do and when I left the House I was annoyed with myself for not having done so. That is the truth.</P>

Will he agree that his failure to do so makes it doubtful he is sincere in saying he wanted to mention it on that occasion because he could not mention it thereafter if he had not mentioned it in his original reply?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said it did not seem to him at the time to be particularly important that he should mention this matter to the Dáil. Would he consider it unfair if people were to say that somebody of his political experience, who has risen to his office and can make a political judgment of that fallibility, would be considered by many not to be really up to his job?</P>

A few minutes before the Ceann Comhairle came into the House, the Taoiseach asked me specifically to ensure a question was asked about the Chief Justice's statement of an hour or so previously so that the Government response could be on the public record.

      <P>The Deputy asked about the press officer in the Department. I had no involvement, but I have a note from him in relation to the queries. Apparently, the press officer was dealing with this from home. I will go through it if the Deputy wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the answering of press queries if representation was made for the early release of Mr. Sheedy, the press officer indicated a vague recollection of receiving a telephone call from the journalist from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on the afternoon of 24 April. He received a number of telephone calls from journalists about a number of other Departmental issues. This would not be unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot recall the precise nature of the queries from the journalist other than that he may have asked a question along the lines of whether there had been political representations requesting that the Minister give Mr. Sheedy temporary release. The journalist may also have asked him another question about the Sheedy case but he cannot recall if that occurred. He does not dispute that his answer to the question was along the lines of &lsquo;no' and that the Minister had never considered the matter of giving concessions to Mr. Sheedy. He said that his understanding of <Col N="208" /> the position was that a number of requests for Mr. Sheedy to be released to attend family events had been refused by Department officials without reference to the Minister. There had been no political representation in respect of these.</P>
    <P>On the telephone conversation involving the Taoiseach's private secretary and the Minister's private secretary in 1998, the essence of it was that the Taoiseach's private secretary inquired about the position. To the best of his knowledge this amounted to a routine inquiry and was not a representation in that sense and that, as far as they were aware, no request was made on behalf of the Taoiseach for concessions for the prisoner.</P>
    <P>I should add that they had no special knowledge of what was recorded in the prisoner's file. I understand that the civil servant was working from home and did not have access to the file.</P>

Did he exercise any judgment in the context of the representation made by him or on his behalf? What was the purpose of the representation?</P>
      <P>In that context, what was the purpose of the representations he made on behalf of Mr. John Ryan who so tragically lost his wife? When he talked to Mr. Ryan on the telephone, around the time of the publication of the Hamilton report, did the Taoiseach inform Mr. Ryan that some nine months earlier he had made representations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seeking that Mr. Sheedy benefit from day release or did he conceal that from Mr. Ryan as well as concealing it from the House?</P>

I have stated that, in my view, in the view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the view of the staff in my office and the staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who deal with representations, this was a routine inquiry. To quote it again, &ldquo;it amounted to a routine inquiry, was not a representation in the sense that as far as it was aware no request was made on behalf of the Taoiseach for concessions for the prisoner&rdquo;. I try to keep in touch and usually on a Saturday or Sunday night I read through letters, write manuscript notes and try to follow up these matters. I have done that for the best part of 25 years, although I do not spend as much time on it now. I no longer hold active clinics as such but I go through the correspondence whenever I can.</P>

That begs the question already posed by Deputy Joe Higgins, namely, was this just another letter, like another casual encounter with a judge in a park, or was it something else? That is the question &ndash; why this letter, why refer to the private secretary and why the concealment until such time as the freedom of information request to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated it would <Col N="211" /> come into the public domain?

The idea of my getting a letter, writing a manuscript note, it being registered on the computer or any other member of the staff making a call about it is not unusual in terms of what I do. It would happen most hours of most days. It may not always be a private secretary who deals with such matters &ndash; it could be any one of the staff &ndash; but in this case it was. It is the way I would operate. Now and again, but not in this case, I might make the call myself if the issue was not about an individual or a community. That is what I would have done.

        <b>: </b>In July 1998 the Taoiseach made a query or representations. It is difficult to accept it was simply out of curiosity that the Taoiseach made his approach on behalf of Philip Sheedy. On 14 October 1998 Philip Sheedy was one year in prison and he had not received a visit from the Taoiseach's friend, Mr. Joe Burke. On 14 October Mr. Joe Burke visited Philip Sheedy and, within four weeks, Mr. Sheedy was out of prison. A Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and a county registrar are now, effectively, gone from office. In all the Taoiseach's conversations with his close friend, Mr. Joe Burke, between 14 October 1998 and today, did he at any stage discuss with him the Philip Sheedy case?</P>

I received representations from the Ryan family, with which I dealt. I also received representations from Mr. Sheedy senior, which I could be accused of not dealing with very well. I checked into it and did not get back to him. His last paragraph explains that. That is the sum total of my involvement.</P>
      <P>I did not make representations to any member of the Judiciary. I did not talk, or send a note, to any member of the Judiciary. I spoke to no court clerks. As far as I am concerned, I did nothing to help Philip Sheedy, other than the one inquiry which I did not follow up very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest we leave anything out which might elicit information or appear at some future point, does the Taoiseach know, or has he ever known, any member of the Anderson family &ndash; father, mother or Ken Anderson? If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was informed on the night of 10 February of serious matters concerning a court case which ultimately led to the resignation of two judges and a court registrar, when was the Taoiseach told of these serious matters? Was it on the night of 10 or 11 February?</P>
      <P>From the time at which he knew of this case, did the Taoiseach request to see the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform file? Did he ask the Minister if the file had been fully examined to ensure all information would be available to the Minister and to the Taoiseach about any matter in the file which might be of concern?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know how it was discovered that a letter from Edward O'Connor, John Ryan's solicitor, was received by the Department on 4-5 February? I have a copy of the letter which is stamped 4 February. A note on it reads, &ldquo;1788 R Gogan Prisons&rdquo;. From my recollection that means the letter went to prisons on 4 February or thereabouts. It does not give a date but it must have been 4 or 5 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To find that letter to allow the Minister to mention it on 1 April, the Department file had to be <Col N="217" /> trawled. Is the Taoiseach satisfied knowledge of the note of his representation was not discovered in the Department until 1 April when his private secretary was told of it casually in Hillsborough by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Was the note relating to the Taoiseach's inquiry found in the Sheedy prison file or in the Minister's private office file? On what date was it found &ndash; should it not have been early after 11 February when the Minister asked the Department's Secretary General to carry out an investigation? How was that investigation carried out?</P>
    <P>Why, in July 1998, did the prison file still record that the review date of October 1999 was still existent? Why did the prison file not show that date had been removed six months earlier, given it is the Department's responsibility to administer the sentences handed down by the courts? The information passed to the Taoiseach's office was that Mr. Sheedy's release, day release or attendance at courses could not be granted because, as the Taoiseach said, there was still a review date on the case.</P>
    <P>Who found the handwritten note on the file recording the telephone call between the Taoiseach's private secretaries and when? The Taoiseach said the letter from Mr. Sheedy senior was sent to St. Luke's. Is a separate file kept in St. Luke's of all correspondence sent to and representations made through that office, so that when someone returns to that office to find out if their query or representation has been answered, the secretary working there has a mirror note or letter of those taken by the Taoiseach to his office? Is this the case and has the Taoiseach checked his files in St. Luke's to see whether this file was available to him there and could he have known about it sooner?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the detailed questions on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not have access to individual files. I did not seek the file or ever look at it. I do not think I have ever seen a file of any kind from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is not my practice to look for files, as I told Deputy Bruton in the House some time ago. I do not know Mr. Ken Anderson or any of the Andersons. If I ever met any of them, it is unknown to me. I have no knowledge of them whatsoever.</P>
      <P>If I was not informed on 10 February, I was certainly informed the following day. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General informed me. I made no checks at that stage because I did not relate the case to any representations I may have received. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has told me that the note recorded from me was on the prisons file. That was mentioned to my private secretary for the first time on 1 April and proceeded with following that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have a mirror note. While I have a computer system in St. Luke's, I keep a great deal <Col N="218" /> of correspondence and papers. I do not have a filing system. I keep papers relating to matters which are held over or held back. While my constituency cases regarding housing, planning, parks, community matters and individual cases would be on the computer system, it is not always up to date and does not provide a mirror image of correspondence.</P>

      <P>When Members made statements on this matter on 1 April, the Tánaiste told me she had spoken to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform four times and was convinced there was no political interference in this matter. Did the Taoiseach make similar inquiries to ensure there was no political interference in the matter? Would those inquiries have at least required him or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the file? Had that been done, would the Taoiseach not have been aware before 1 April that direct representations were made by him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a specific question. I said the Tánaiste volunteered the information that she had sought assurances that there was no political interference. I took her at her word. If there was a reference on the file to a representation, I would have expected the Tánaiste to tell me &ndash; I know she would have &ndash; there was a representation, but that it was absolutely acceptable and there was no impropriety in it. It would have been adverted to. It was not. Did the Taoiseach make similar inquiries?</P>
      <P>First, is it not incredible that the Taoiseach was not aware of his involvement before 1 April? Second, would the Taoiseach not have found it appropriate, as soon as he became aware of it, to explain that it was an absolutely proper and appropriate representation, rather than seeking to conceal it with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as the Taoiseach admitted?</P>

      <P>Has the Government acted on the recommendation made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform committee investigating the handling of the Sheedy case, which is to the effect that Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly's retrospective attempt to alter the file on the Sheedy case subsequent to his hearing of that case and his decision to release Mr. Sheedy is a matter which should be referred to the prosecuting authorities? If not, why not? Did the Taoiseach take part in discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to approving the pension arrangements for Mr. Justice Kelly? Why did the Taoiseach not ask Mr. Justice Kelly, as a condition of those arrangements being put in place, to explain why he took the strange course of action he took in the Sheedy case? If the Taoiseach did not ask that Mr. Justice Kelly should provide those explanations, can he justify why he and the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform failed to do so?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has asked the House to believe that he and the Tánaiste agreed he would mention this matter in the Dáil. Will the Taoiseach therefore explain what he meant when he said:</P>
      <P>I find it amusing, sad and hilarious all at once that the idea of me jumping up in the Dáil and saying &ldquo;Listen now I want to say something about my involvement in the Sheedy case and the Mrs. Ryan case&rdquo; that the Dáil would have said &lsquo;Oh thanks very much, that is great now, we will all go out for the weekend'. If I had taken such an action, the Dáil would have gone into its usual ballistic self and looked for a suspension of Standing Orders. There would have been ructions if I attempted to raise the matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach said on Monday night. How does the Taoiseach reconcile that statement with what he is saying now? He clearly indicated his contempt for raising the matter in the Dáil and said it would have been amusing and hilarious to do so. How can he reconcile that with what he is saying now, which is that he had agreed with the Tánaiste that he would bring it up in the Dáil?

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the current Budget surplus projected this year and the anticipated proceeds of the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, calls on the Government to immediately commit £140 million of public expenditure to alleviate the national traffic crisis in Dublin and other large regional urban areas; and further calls on the Minister for Public Enterprise to expend this allocation on the following measures to urgently enhance public transport capacity and alleviate traffic flows:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the immediate ordering and purchase of an additional 250 buses this year for Dublin Bus, specifically to operate on the 11 quality bus corridors, with the objective of providing in the inner cordon area a bus every minute in peak times and every ten minutes thereafter;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the provision of additional bus maintenance, garage, depot and other facilities to service this expansion of the bus fleet;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the availability of &lsquo;real time' information systems at bus stops as to vehicle location and passenger information;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the availability of an integrated ticketing system with a specific provision for both day and monthly tickets covering multi-journeys;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the provision of a satellite-facilitated, centrally-controlled vehicle tracking system for the entire bus network and a central radio call centre for the taxi industry;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the availability of bus route franchising, whereby Dublin Bus would subcontract selected arterial routes to the private sector, particularly for cross-city travel;</P>
      <P>&ndash;to carry out an immediate study and design of potential reverse and contraflow routes;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the enhancement of air-to-ground traffic surveillance to extend coverage to the entire urban area of Dublin;</P>
      <P>&ndash;additional investment in high technology traffic control systems in the suburbs to maximise junction capacity and ensure priority for public transport;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" />&ndash;the expansion of Operation Freeflow through additional staff resources, including training;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been in office for almost two years and during that time the traffic gridlock has become worse in our major cities. Excuses, such as lack of time or context, do not apply in this case. The commuting time for people travelling to and from this city each morning is longer and the congestion is worse. The same is true of other regional centres such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. One has only to listen to the AA Roadwatch bulletins and to witness the daily trauma of people trying to commute to and from work to realise the seriousness of the problem.</P>
      <P>There has been no shortage of analysis of this problem. The DTI analysed it for ten years and the Minister has commissioned numerous reports, including the Atkins and Andersen reports. There is now the possibility that the requirement for passenger journeys will outstrip the availability of transport services. The Minister should take the European job the Taoiseach is trying to give her and allow someone with vigour and enthusiasm to resolve the traffic gridlock while she enjoys the greener fields of Europe, where the plush surroundings will complement her ministerial pedigree.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>This would enable the Celtic tiger's problem of traffic gridlock to be dealt with in a tigerish fashion by another Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be remembered for not providing the necessary additional public resources and for allowing Government borrowing, rather than Exchequer grants, to increase in the context of rail safety. Last May she took the critical step of deferring the Luas project, which had its limitations, but which had been designed to include a loop route from Tallaght to the city and Dundrum. The Minister aborted that scheme which cost £220 million and was to be co-financed by Europe. She lunged into a dark tunnel &ndash; an experiment which is no closer to reality and which will not be available until 2005. The cost increased from over £400 million to £677 million to over £1 billion. The Department of Finance became so frustrated at the unravelling of Luas that the Arthur Andersen report had to be compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> It has been suggested that PPPs will solve all our problems. Who will invest £1.3 billion in Luas without an underwritten commitment that they will get an annual subsidy for passenger journeys? The Minister has ensured that the streets of Dublin will not be dug up before the next general election, although that seems imminent, and that the Government will not have to finance Luas. She has not put forward any solution to this critical problem, particularly in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>This issue goes beyond the direct interests of transport. The gridlock in Dublin is a barrier to economic growth and has resulted in the deterioration of the city's efficiency and people's quality of life. People get up extraordinarily early in the morning and arrive home late at night to avoid the traffic rush hour. The continued growth of the economy, population and housing in Dublin means an increase in required passenger journeys of 10 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister's legacy will be a constant deferral of a concrete solution to this problem. My motion gives the Minister a solution which is practicable, can be implemented and is easy to understand. A Minister has not had more fortuitous circumstances to deal with this problem. Normally, a Minister in a high spending Department is faced with the problem of being told the Exchequer has no money. That has often been true. I am talking about capital expenditure, current expenditure, economic investment and social expenditure. What is the situation now? In the next eight weeks, an AIB account will receive over £1 billion from the proceeds of the minimal amount of sale of Telecom Éireann shares &ndash; even if the Minister seeks only the 20 per cent stake, she will get £1 billion. It is winging its way to the Minister. It does not need any hype or advertising. People will buy these shares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that. Will the Minister produce the record. I have always said there would be a huge demand for shares. On another day I will argue how the Minister succeeded in making a botched job of it with two resignations and the fat cats will walk away with the windfall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will receive £1 billion from Telecom Éireann. The first quarter Exchequer returns show a 13.3 per cent increase in tax receipts while the budget for the year was 7.5 per cent. This will yield a current budget surplus in excess of £1.5 billion. Under the capital and current accounts this extra cash is rolling into the Department of Finance, yet, in those extraordinary favourable circumstances, the Minister has not succeeded in earmarking any major allo<Col N="230" /> cation to the public policy problem of transport capacity.</P>
      <P>The £140 million is necessary. Given that Ireland has one of the lowest national debt to GNP ratios this is good economic sense. In the 1980s all the economic forecasters advised cutting public expenditure; now they all speak about the infrastructure deficit, yet the Minister cannot take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem that can be resolved. We are calling for a further 250 new articulated and double-decker buses. I have been in contact with those directly involved. An articulated bus which can carry about 120 people costs about £300,000, is state of the art and is available. A double-decker bus which can carry about 80 people costs £200,000. That number of new buses, which would cost less than £65 million, should be put in place and can be made disabled-access friendly. The obvious knock-on effect is that extra maintenance depots would be required and a new garage would have to be built, probably in Tallaght. I understand £14 million would cover the cost.</P>
      <P>These buses should be put on the quality bus corridors. What will happen, as is the case in Lucan and Malahide, as the QBCs are put in place is that there will be less space for the motorist. It is a source of great angst to motorists who see an empty bus lane with a lack of public transport vehicles in it. I ask that in the main these buses be allocated to the QBCs in train and for which the money has been provided, and for an expansion of the bus fleet without an increase in Dublin Bus's debt. If there is a problem a particular route can be franchised out through sub-contract or competition but it must happen.</P>
      <P>As on the DART, and on the tube in London, every bus-stop on a QBC must have real time information; that may be a little speaker which will say the next bus will arrive. Satellite tracking facilities in the bus and a satellite vehicle checking system would ensure the location of every bus was readily identifiable.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Dublin Bus that the target of a bus every minute at peak hours and every ten minutes thereafter is achievable on QBCs. This does not require endless reports, consultants, more photo opportunities for the Minister and more waffle. We simply want the buses to be provided. This requires a political decision. The Minister has only to bring memorandum to the Cabinet and get the observations of the Department of Finance. I fail to see how the Minister after two years, with all her political experience, has not put this in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke earlier about hard-nosed economists decrying public expenditure and particularly public transport. The DKM report of February 1999, <Col N="231" /> which is a review of transport infrastructure needs, which the Minister should read&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I read everything. I do not lack energy as the Deputy did in his day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no complaints in the Department.</P>
      <P>Section 5 on urban transport sets out the requirement based on technical data and assessment of passenger journeys. CIE has submitted a proposal to the Minister for £15 million expenditure for buses in Cork; £5 million for park and ride facilities and for rail and bus in Galway and Limerick cities £16 million and £14 million respectively. The population growth is at its sharpest in the regional and larger urban areas. We are all aware of rural depopulation. This matter is straightforward and needs to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I understand the real time information system would cost £700,000 per QBC route. I am frustrated to the point of almost giving up that the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will reform the Road Transport Act, 1932, to introduce an equivalent of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to introduce public service contracts and legalised competition. That is the only way to proceed and we will be obliged by the EU to do it.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister is good at speaking with the chairpersons of State companies, I cannot understand why she will not call in the chairman of CIE and ask him to put in place an integrated ticketing system by August or October 1 If people have to take two buses into town they must get separate tickets. They should be able to get a ticket which would cover any journey in Dublin city by public transport or a monthly ticket.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, will deal with traffic surveillance and management. Mr. Owen Keegan and his colleagues in Dublin Corporation are doing a good job putting the suburban junction high-tech systems, at a cost of £10 million, in place and expanding Operation Freeflow. There is only one Garda helicopter available. The information available needs to be improved as we make the best of the road structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her term of office the Minister has allowed a crisis to evolve into a catastrophe. It requires national political leadership. The Minister's alibi in the Department of Public Enterprise is that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for roads and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the Garda, or her alibi is in the semi-State companies and the local authorities. I attach some of the blame for a lack of political leadership to the Taoiseach. He has shown no <Col N="232" /> interest in the public transport arena other than to intervene in the taxi industry dispute.</P>
    <P>The national infrastructure deficit in terms of transport requirements runs to several billion pounds. The £140 million being sought in this motion would not solve all the problems but would deal with the worst and most urgent problem &ndash; the urban gridlock.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposals are practical, affordable and can be implemented and they should be commended to the House. Failure to respond will result in dire medium-term consequences which are strangling the major cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion was tabled because we have come to the conclusion that it is time to panic about our public transport infrastructure in the hope of infusing some sense of urgency into the Government to take decisions and implement them. The public may not yet know the extent of the problem and how it is predicted to deteriorate in the coming years. However, they know there is a problem and that the solution is a mass quality public transport system. This would provide not only an alternative to the motor car for those who seek it but a quality system for those who are totally dependent on public transport. The public does not know and cannot understand why the Government does not grasp that fact.</P>
      <P>The efforts of Ministers at media events and in making concerned utterances about the state of traffic in Dublin and what could be done about it are beginning to show diminishing returns. The public do not believe them. The evidence of their eyes and their daily experience tells them that congestion is getting worse. I commend the work of Dublin Corporation's Owen Keegan, but the benefits of the small measures which are being taken are being eroded as quickly as they are introduced because of the growth in traffic.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Yates said, the problem has been studied to death. Only last weekend I read that the Minister had yet again announced the latest study into integrated ticketing. The Minister knows how many times it has been studied and she is aware of the problem, which is ongoing revenue and capital implications. No amount of studies will change that; it will always be the problem. The solution is to pay the money, order the technology, install it and get on with the job. The time for studies on this and all other aspects of transport is long passed. It is now time for decisions and action.</P>

    <P>As any public representative in the Dublin area will say, there is growing anger and intolerance among the public about the deterioration in the quality of life for Dubliners, particularly in urban areas, due to congestion and lack of access. If the public had access to the information the Government has about predictions for the next ten years regarding population changes, land use, economic activity, the number of people going to work and <Col N="233" /> the volume of goods which will be bought and sold, that mood of anger would quickly change to one of panic as they see our economic well-being dissipated through lack of action. It is disturbing that there is no sign of panic on the part of the Government which is in possession of all these facts. There is no sense of urgency or awareness that we are moving from crisis to catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Approximately 18 months ago I was ridiculed in the House by Ministers and backbenchers for suggesting that there was a need for a Minister for traffic. I wonder how many Dublin Deputies are now scoffing at that idea and how many less will scoff at it following the European and local elections after being told in the campaign at every door that people want buses and not the traffic problems. There is a need for a Minister to manage the panic because nobody is in charge of the current confusion. Nobody is responsible for ensuring that strategic decisions for the long-term are made and that financial resources are secured. There is nobody to drive and implement these decisions once they are made.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest mysteries is the role of the Taoiseach and his stance on this issue. Even if he was not a Dublin Deputy with even a passing interest in the fate of Dublin, as Taoiseach he has primary responsibility for securing the economic future of the country and its well-being. Every report, commentary, consultant and sector is telling us that the biggest single obstacle to sustaining our economic growth is our lack of infrastructure and primarily our transport infrastructure. The Taoiseach has shown no interest in the problem. He has not even given a sign that he is aware of it. His only intervention was to obstruct the efforts of others to solve the problem in the taxi industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true and the Deputy knows it. Only one body was willing to make a decision and when it was made, the Taoiseach intervened. It is time for the Taoiseach to either address the traffic problem in Dublin or to appoint somebody to do so. I do not suggest that this is the first Government to ignore the growing congestion problems or that has failed to invest in transport infrastructure or resource CIE. However, the difference is that it is the first Government which has had the economic freedom to do anything about it. If it does not do anything, it will destroy that economic freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I and Deputy Yates said, we are moving from crisis to catastrophe. This catastrophe will not manifest itself in one cataclysmic event such as permanent gridlock. That will not happen because people are too rational to allow it. The catastrophe will manifest itself in the slow but lethal strangulation and atrophy of the economic <Col N="234" /> and social life of Dublin and all the promise they hold for this and future generations. The coffers have never been as full and, therefore, there are no financial excuses for inaction. If the will exists, the money is available.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the specific investment and long-term strategic decisions which are required although the motion refers to action which could be taken in the short-term. It is clear from what we know about the existing unmet passenger demand and the recent publication of the strategic guidelines for Dublin, which map the future population and settlement developments for Dublin over the next ten to 12 years, that a major part of the transport solution lies in new and enhanced commuter rail lines. We have read in the media and heard leaks about endless discussions on the possibilities of new lines and stations, new tunnels in place of old tunnels, expanding track capacity, loop lines, joining existing lines and a new mega rail terminus. There have been endless debates and countless studies, but not one decision has been taken. It is inexcusable given all the studies, reports, consultants and expertise that are available to the Government that it has not even decided what should be done.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more aware than the Minister about the long lead in time for major rail construction, including the long planning, design and construction phases. Anything from ten to 20 years is a conservative estimate from decision date to realisation. However, nothing can start until decisions are made. If these crucial decision are not made now, they will be inappropriate and probably redundant by the time they are made and implemented. Long-term strategic decisions must be made and excuses such as waiting for the result of the application for the next round of European funds are no longer justified. We need to begin now. We do not need the EU money. It will be great if it arrives, but we must make our own decisions about our infrastructure. This infrastructure is necessary regardless of whether the money is available. We must get on with planning our future.</P>
    <P>We cannot wait to see what other public or private agencies are doing before making these strategic decisions. If a new rail terminus is needed, it should be built. We should not wait on other decisions, such as whether a conference centre is needed. Those type of considerations should not come into decisions about which the Minister needs to be single minded. Even if the long-term strategic decisions were made today, as the Minister knows, they will do nothing to help the problem this year, next year or even the year after. It is forecast that the problem will grow until at least 2011.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, the only quick solution is the bus. It is the only mode of transport which can be provided relatively quickly to alleviate <Col N="235" /> demand. If Dublin is to remain viable and sustain its projected employment figures, carrying capacity must be delivered quickly. We will make further suggestions about measures which could be put in place quickly. However, the underlying bus issue must be tackled. There is huge anger among the public at measures to reduce car usage while no alternatives are being put in place. Empty bus lanes are not the answer and the 150 which have been announced and reannounced will not fill them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 150 routes in Dublin, which equals one bus per route. In addition, the removal of buses from existing routes to fill the bus lanes and shore up deficiencies elsewhere is driving people wild in Dublin and particularly in my constituency. A finger in the dyke is not good enough. We need more buses, either with CIE or the competition providing the service. Telling people that complex legislation is required does not wash, We either charge the legislation or provide the resources for CIE to do the job. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>It is totally mystifying to everybody in this city that the private sector can compete with CIE in every other part of the country except Dublin. Dublin Bus would be well able to compete given its expertise and would benefit from the competition. The public would benefit once it is established that there must be a level playing pitch for everybody providing the service and accepted in principle that the service must be subvented. There is no way we can provide a quality public transport service unless the service is subvented.</P>
      <P>Buses may not be the sexy answer we crave &ndash; perhaps we would love tunnels &ndash; but the reality is that they are the only answer in the short-term. They can deliver the carrying capacity we need within the timescale. They are costly measures, but if you say it quickly £140 million does not sound very much. In reality it is very little compared to the cost of doing nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. Increased public expenditure is required to upgrade and improve the public transport capacity to alleviate traffic flows. Traffic jams, gridlock and delays are common, not only in Dublin but in many of our towns and cities. I will not dwell on the historical context but in the 1950's and 196O's the Government policy of the day &ndash; to a great extent Fianna Fáil administrations &ndash; was to close down railway services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragedy is that railway services were closed in many parts, particularly in the north-west. The closure of the Harcourt Street line was the greatest scandal of all.</P>
      <P>We need to upgrade and improve our public transport services. It is important to cut back on the number of cars entering Dublin and other cities. Improved train services to Dublin are essential to cater for the commuter traffic from the provincial towns. An increasing number of large housing estates are being built in provincial towns for people who work in Dublin. People are commuting to Dublin from the Minister's town of Athlone, from Tullamore, Portlaoise and Stradbally, which is a relatively small town. This is the case already in many towns near Dublin.</P>
      <P>The DART service is excellent. I have travelled on the excellent Arrow service from Kildare and Maynooth. I am annoyed, however, that commuters from Tullamore, Clara, Portlaoise and Portarlington will suffer a deterioration in the train service because of timetable changes. The Minister may not be aware of this but I will forward the details to her. Members of Iarnród Éireann met with members of Offaly County Council but we got little joy from that. By improving the train services from provincial towns we will alleviate gridlock in Dublin. Towns such as Portlaoise, Tullamore and Athlone should have a train service to and from Dublin on the hour every hour. I hope the Minister will accept this motion.</P>

      <P>I commend my colleagues, Deputies Yates and Mitchell, for bringing forward this timely motion. The Minister who will get the money from the sale of Telecom Éireann should be able to use a portion of it to improve the transport infrastructure throughout the country. I note in the casual exchange we had earlier that she announced the reopening of the Mullingar to Athlone railway line.</P>

      <P>She said she would reopen it and I hope we can take that as a commitment from the Minister who I hope will announce the good news officially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provincial towns are growing at an amazing rate. Towns such as Mullingar, Athlone, Tullamore and Portlaoise have had a huge increase in population, with new housing estates being built for the people commuting to Dublin. I estimate <Col N="237" /> there may be as many at 1,500 to 2,000 people travelling from the greater Mullingar area to Dublin every day. Regretfully, most are travelling by car. The commuter line from Mullingar is carrying about 100 each morning. If that line were improved, many of the passengers travelling by car would use it. In fairness, the Minister has committed £12.5 million for track renewal and £5 million for signalling, but that will not come on-stream until the end of next year. Will the Minister consider the possibility of bringing forward the expenditure, so that the service could come on-stream earlier. A double line from Maynooth to Dublin would improve the service dramatically. Many of the Minister's colleagues in Dublin West would like to see that programme accelerated. It will cost £17 million but there must be a way of bringing it on-stream earlier than three years. This would be a tremendous service for west Dublin. In the past small rural stations such as Killucan and Streete were closed, but with the increasing numbers now living and commuting to Dublin from these areas, the railway line could be reopened at minimal expense, taking people off the roads and improving the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>The service on the Dublin-Sligo railway line was raised on many occasions in the House. I compliment the Minister for providing the resources to upgrade the line in the coming years, but work needs to be carried out more quickly. Last week in the local Sligo newspaper, it was reported that rail tracks will be transferred from the Dublin-Cork railway line and the Dublin-Westport railway line, as second-hand welded tracks, to the Longford-Sligo line. There is a lack of confidence in the rail service and if second-hand track were used, it would further erode the confidence of commuters. People ask if the Government is committed to providing a proper rail service from Sligo to Dublin. They believe that if second-hand track is used from Longford to Sligo the standard of service required will not be provided. I have no doubt that people would use the train from Sligo to Dublin if there were a proper service. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm or deny that.</P>

      <P>No, although Deputy Joe Higgins says I have a mania for it. I hope some of the money raised from the work we are doing in various semi-State companies would go towards public transport. In case a false impression is created &ndash; I am tired of telling Deputy Yates this, but he insists on saying it &ndash; the money does not go to the Department of Public Enterprise, although my Department and the Department of Finance are currently engaged on Telecom Éireann matters. The money goes to the Department of Finance. The Deputy knows, because I told him, how much is owed over the last 20 years in pension funds and I do not know what the Government is going to contribute from public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McGrath is my constituency colleague I will reply to him now. He asked about the double railway track from Maynooth and the expenditure on the Mullingar line. That will come between this year and next year because it is part of the funding intended originally for Luas, which I will talk about shortly. I am interested in Killucan railway station and will visit it on Monday week. The Deputy has a penchant for putting his script in the local newspapers and I want my <Col N="239" /> remarks to be there also. I have been invited to Killucan to look at the defunct station. The station building was knocked down &ndash; I do not know why, but it was many years ago while Fine Gael was in Government. Also, for the benefit of the <i>Westmeath-Offaly Independent</i>, in 1975 the then Fine Gael-Labour Government closed the Mullingar-Athlone railway line. I will look at this matter, although I do not have a ready answer. Killucan has distinct possibilities and I would be glad to include it in our strategic plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is the actual wording which I will receive in a few weeks. It is most interesting.</P>
      <P>The £70 million in the plan was formerly committed to Luas. Previous Governments demanded that CIE found the money itself but we provided the cash. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, together with the local and regional authorities in the greater Dublin area, commissioned the preparation of the strategic planning guidelines. The Government gave me the go-ahead for costing and feasibility work on a major suburban rail development, taking account of the recommendations of those guidelines. The DTO will shortly present me the plan for 2000-2006. This is a high level of activity.</P>
      <P>I consulted the records for the previous four years and it is amazing that action was not taken by successive Governments. CIE was merely told to &ldquo;find the money&rdquo;. I agree that additional buses must be provided in the short-term. Deputy Pat Carey informs me that, for various reasons, not all of the 12 quality bus corridors are in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>

      <P>I am informed that the 12 quality bus corridors will be completed by the end of the year 2000. I do not know the cause of this delay but I understand that this matter has been discussed by Dublin Corporation. Perhaps Deputy Mitchell could confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Malahide Road and Lucan bus corridors are already in place and further QBCs at Rathfarnham, Tallaght and north Finglas will be completed this year.</P>
      <P>Quality bus corridors are having an impact. On the Lucan QBC, the bus has a 50 per cent market share at Conyngham Road and on the Malahide Road QBC, buses are 30 per cent faster than cars. We need to increase the size of the bus fleet. Deputy Olivia Mitchell was present at the ceremony to hand over the first of the 150 new buses for which the Exchequer provided funding. I approached the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, seeking funding to provide additional buses and he acceded to my request. Provision was made in my Department's Estimate in that regard. I do not believe the Deputies are satisfied with what is provided, they only want what I do not have at present. Since the foundation of the State, a budget has never been introduced in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU is providing £5.5 million towards the cost of acquiring 50 of those buses and the balance, £20 million, will be provided by the Exchequer. The Exchequer will also be responsible for providing funding for the provision of garaging and workshop facilities for the expanding fleet. That point is covered by the motion and I agree with it fully.</P>
      <P>In two weeks the DTO will be making recommendations for a substantial upgrading of the bus network in the greater Dublin area. This will build on the DTO's previous short-term action plan and I expect it to recommend a substantial increase in the bus fleet; further development of QBCs; the introduction of a wider range of orbital routes, which will cross existing orbital routes and provide a better web of services and the provision of additional local and feeder services.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputies' comments in respect of certain technical matters. Deputy Olivia Mitchell and I spoke about the ticketing system at Question Time recently. It is necessary for CIE to conclude its deliberations in respect of the integrated ticketing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a revenue implication which must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that CIE believes there is a revenue implication. However, with proper forethought in respect of the arrangements to be put in place, I do not believe that this need be the case. The excuse that something involves a revenue implication is often used to scupper a project. I told CIE to put the integrated ticketing system in place to ascertain what might be the outcome. I asked what would be the rev<Col N="243" /> enue implications and I was informed that people will dodge fares. People have dodged fares since I was a child but most people pay their way. I do not believe an integrated ticketing system will have a revenue implication once it is operated in a proper fashion.</P>
      <P>The new Xpresso service which I launched recently will continue to be introduced on a phased basis, every three months, for the remainder of the year. I pay tribute to the EU and CIE because, following discussion between the two, co-funding has been provided for accessible buses, a number of which have already come on stream. After next year, all new buses will have to be low-floor, accessible vehicles. This means that everyone, not only those who are physically disabled but also those with temporary impairments, will be able to gain access to buses.</P>
      <P>The DTO allocated significant funding to improving traffic control facilities in the Dublin area. I am informed that there is a need for a regional traffic control centre and this, along with proposals to use new technology in improving traffic control, is an aspect will be included in the DTO's revised plan. I hope to receive that plan in two to three weeks time.</P>
      <P>I have recognised the advantages which real time passenger information would offer to bus passengers. This system would enable passengers at bus stops to know the expected arrival time of their bus and would include a display in selected bus stop shelters giving a countdown in minutes of the expected arrival time of the bus. The design work is nearing completion and the system will be put into operation later this year, initially on the Lucan QBC.</P>
      <P>The strategic planning guidelines place particular emphasis on the development of rail corridors. A full DART service to Greystones and Malahide will be introduced next year, while a partial service to Greystones will commence in the coming months.</P>

      <P>New stations have been opened, including at Fairview on the DART line and Drumcondra and Kilcock on the Maynooth line. Work has commenced on the development <Col N="244" /> of Barrow Street station, between the Pearse and Lansdowne Road stations, and it is expected to open in 2000.</P>
      <P>New park and ride facilities have been completed at Donabate and the car park at Skerries has been substantially extended. Attention is now focusing on improving parking facilities at Greystones, Clontarf Road and Bray. This is being co-financed by the EU and the Exchequer. Additional carriages are required for the DART. The construction of period for these is understandably longer than for buses but the original order of ten DART carriages is due for delivery in September while a further 16 will be delivered in September 2000. These 26 carriages will be used to enhance existing services and to operate six car train sets. They will also be used to cater for the extended DART network to Malahide and Greystones and will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 106 carriages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the new carriages be accessible to people with disabilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. From 1 January 2000, all new buses will also be low-floor, accessible vehicles.</P>
      <P>A £5 million programme of platform improvements for the DART and suburban rail network has been approved and the platform improvements at DART stations have already commenced. It is expected that this work will be completed by the end of 2000. The Maynooth line is being upgraded with the provision of double track from Clonsilla to Maynooth. A real time passenger information service has been introduced on the DART network.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the strategic planning guidelines, I secured Government approval to carry out costings and feasibility work for a new suburban commuter rail development plan. All the rail elements of the short-term action plan, when implemented, will boost the existing development programme which will see peak hour capacity on the greater Dublin suburban network increase by 60 per cent, or 11,300 passenger train journeys.</P>
      <P>The plan comprises two elements. First, there is a short-term programme based on making more intensive use of the existing rail corridors. The second element involves a long-term programme based on certain conceptual suggestions for improving the suburban rail network contained in the strategic planning guidelines. The focus of the short-term programme over the next two to five years will be to make more intensive use of the existing rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proposed that new rail stations could provided at Lucan north, Lucan south and Ashington and that the line between Connolly and Heuston stations should be upgraded. The possibility of developing a new inland rail link to <Col N="245" /> Navan has also been suggested. Deputy John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, put forward extensive questions about a possible rail line to Navan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. Proposals also exist in respect of the possible separation of long distance and commuter rail traffic through the construction of by-pass rail lines. The options also include enhancement of rail service to the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines &ndash; phase one, namely, Drogheda, Naas, Newbridge, Kilcullen, Wicklow and Navan and under phase two, Athy, Arklow, Kildare and Monasterevin. There will also be more sophisticated signalling technology to increase track capacity. We asked CIE to arrange to have this work done without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

Measures being considered include the upgrading of service on the Mallow-Cork-Cobh lines and possibly reopening the Middleton line, depending on plans for development in the line catchment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was the epitomy of a good Minister because he obeyed the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Initial indications are that a system based on electronic smart card technology could be introduced on a phased basis in Dublin and detailed evaluation of this option is currently being undertaken. I disagree with the claim that the introduction of integrated ticketing could have significant capital cost and revenue implications. My Department was told by CIE that integrated ticketing would have revenue implications. I cannot see how it could. I believe it would have terrific implications for the consumer who would have access to a decent integrated system.</P>
      <P>The public transport components of the other major urban areas of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will also be considered in the preparation of the National Development Plan. I asked CIE to submit investment reviews of those cities. The primary emphasis of the reviews was on improvements to the bus service through investment in fleet and the introduction of bus priority measures. The Cork review also referred to the development of the suburban rail network, which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in the House recently, the Government has committed £70 million in the Estimates this year alone to making the renaissance of public transport a reality. We are working to ensure that the public transport system not <Col N="247" /> only has the physical capacity to meet transport demand but is capable of meeting the wider needs of its customers. It must be frequent and reliable, giving good value for money and be safe and customer focused.</P>
    <P>While a great deal was achieved in recent years, much more remains to be done. Identifying the capacity requirements and securing the funding necessary is only part of what has to be undertaken. Substantial amounts of money need to be invested and we need to ensure we are getting benefit from those investments.</P>
    <P>CIE and the DTO are in the process of finalising their action plans for the years to 2006. Their work, which I hope to receive in a fortnight, is expected to confirm our belief that there is an enormous challenge facing transport planners and operators in meeting the anticipated growth.</P>
    <P>The Government can be relied on to provide a properly planned and co-ordinated response to the transport challenges in our major urban areas. We will set out a clear strategy to address those problems in the forthcoming National Development Plan, when we have received and considered the detailed proposals of the DTO.</P>
    <P>Of all of the agencies under my remit and business in my Department, public transport is the issue that is the most important for the future. This issue is not only of consideration to Dublin people, even though four of the Members present come from Dublin and the bulk of people who need a daily public transport system come from the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The opening up of defunct railway stations in the towns I mentioned would facilitate much more commuter traffic to and from Dublin. Deputy McGrath talked about Mullingar. A great number of commuters travel from Athlone to Dublin every morning and return to Athlone in the evening. It is a long journey, particularly for young women, many of whom have young families. They find it tough commuting to work in Dublin, but that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>Towns throughout the country that were bypassed can now be given new life. Towns, like Monasterevin, where only a shell of the railway station remains, are on commuter lines. In the plans under preparation, why not give the people of Monasterevin, Athy, Lucan north and south and other towns on rail lines, which are not used because there is no halting facility, the chance to avail of the rail service that passes through their towns? </P>
    <P>We spoke earlier about who closed various lines down through the years. We all fell in love with trains in the last century, then we all fell out of love with them and in love with cars. Every family wanted a car and then two cars. Cars became a status symbol. Trains were under utilised and in many cases the tracks were left to rot. There is only continuous welded track on the <Col N="248" /> Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Belfast and Dublin-Galway lines. We have embarked on a nationwide job to extend continuous welded track thoughout the country. A total of £600 million is to be spent on this work, £88 million is to be spent on level crossings, £40 million on bridges and fences and £20 million on signalling. That money will be spent first on developing the public transport infrastructure and then on carriages, integrated ticketing, suburban rail lines and the provision of extra buses. As Deputy Yates said, this represents a major investment. A major investment in public infrastructure must be undertaken by the Government. We have made a start by allocating £70 million to it this year and more will have to be spent by future Governments.</P>
    <P>I dealt with Dublin Bus. Train travel is environmentally friendly and train travel here is very safe compared to other European countries. It is a relaxing way to travel.</P>

      <P>We must accept that public transport will never make a profit. There is no point in seeking to shoehorn either the railway system or the Dublin bus system into a state where it will be in the black on the balance sheet. There will always be a need for subvention of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to falling in and out of love with rail in the 1950s and 1960s. A political decision was taken to save money on the rail sys<Col N="250" /> tem. That is why there is such a dilapidated system now with large parts of the State having no rail service at all. When I go to County Donegal, I complain that there is not a single railway line running to that county. The one county on this island which actually needs a rail link does not have one and, as far as I know, there is none planned. Perhaps with the Good Friday Agreement there may eventually be a line to County Donegal through Northern Ireland. It is criminal, however, that the county has no rail link with the rest of the country and there are no plans for one.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate on transport in the Dublin area. That is where I live and it is the area I represent. Addressing the issue of rail and bus travel for the country as a whole is important if we are to benefit from economic growth. We should use the resources we have now to put the infrastructure in place, not to give it all to the bankers by paying off the third lowest national debt in the European Union. It is essential to use the resources we have now to put in place a transport infrastructure which will ensure we can continue to benefit from the capacity for the economy to grow.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about a light rail system for Dublin for ten years but we have yet to see a metre of rail laid or a single tram acquired. It is not surprising that scepticism among the people of the city and county has increased, with many doubting that the project will ever go ahead. The bumbling delays, rejections of consultants' reports and U-turns which have been such a feature of this Government's handling of the issue have simply increased public scepticism, against the background of a traffic problem of such magnitude that it is no exaggeration to say that the city and country are in danger of grinding to a halt. That can be seen by moving five minutes from this House at any time of the day.</P>
    <P>A year after the Government decision to reject the consultant's report favouring the overground option for Luas, we still do not know if it will be technically feasible to put an underground section in place. Even if all targets are met, it will still be five years before there is any operational light rail system in the city. It is clear that we cannot allow the traffic situation to continue to deteriorate until light rail is available. Urgent remedial action is required.</P>
    <P>While the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke dithered, week by week the situation grew worse. Traffic conditions which were once the norm for an hour at peak time in the mornings and evenings are now being experienced throughout the day. Even relatively short journeys at peak time now take on epic proportions.</P>
    <P>The key to dealing with the traffic problems in the short-term rests with the proper development of the bus service. Bus services will remain the only transport option for the vast majority of Dublin people for the foreseeable future. Con<Col N="251" /> trary to the public perception, the level of subvention for Dublin Bus, at 3.8p per passenger journey, remains one of the lowest for any similar sized city in Europe. Much of the bus fleet is clapped out, mechanically unreliable and unpleasant to travel on. Just £30 million, less than the cost of one underground station, would allow Dublin Bus to acquire 175 additional buses which would make a great difference to the quality of public transport in the city and county.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the commitment made by Fianna Fáil to ensure the provision of wheelchair accessible buses in the city has been virtually abandoned. It is allowing Dublin Bus to purchase new buses which will not be accessible. That is a slap in the face to those who require public transport more than anyone else. Public transport includes taxis and hackneys. The number of taxis which are wheelchair accessible is minuscule and there are questions about their availability to people who require them when they require them. There needs to be a rededication to the commitment to ensure that the bus fleet we provide is accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The combination of poor service, high fares and chronic traffic problems is forcing more people away from public transport and into their cars. This worsens the traffic problem, slows down the buses and is of particular inconvenience to those who have no alternative but to use public transport. The vicious circle must be broken.</P>
    <P>The pricing and ticketing policy of Dublin Bus must be examined as an integral part of any solution to Dublin's traffic problem. It is not good enough for the Minister to wash her hands of the issue every time I table a question on it, saying that ticketing and pricing are matters for Dublin Bus. The social and economic costs of crawling traffic and congested streets are well known. The solution requires an efficient public transport system with economic fares. This cannot be provided on the level of subvention currently provided to Dublin Bus, which appears to be whatever is left after subventions to rail and other services. That is not a proper way to develop the bus service.</P>
    <P>New car registrations in Dublin reached a record level last year of 62,000. The city cannot continue to absorb this level of new car registration. We must face the prospect of disincentives which will discourage people from bringing cars into the city centre. This can only be done when there is a reliable, efficient and economic public transport system. Unless we set about ensuring this now &ndash; not waiting for Luas &ndash; the situation will continue to deteriorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The sum sought &ndash; £140 million &ndash; is modest. I looked at the public capital programmes as far back as 1990 and it is striking how little money the State put into public transport and traffic management. <Col N="252" /> The Dublin region was deliberately starved by the major parties of the resources it needed to create a proper public transport system.</P>
      <P>Given the performance of the Government, I do not hold out much hope that the funding necessary to implement the recommendations of the recent report on the railway safety programme and track renewal will be forthcoming. As my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, has done, if one examines the major projects we have debated one will see we have talked about a Metro system for Dublin since 1971, when CIE management came up with a workable programme to implement a radial city network of public rail transport. Many of the trendy voices in the 1980s, Vincent Browne in particular, criticised this project, and the DART project, without having any information on cost benefit, etc. The DART has brought enormous benefit to both the northside and the southside and an overwhelming case can be made for its extension to the entire city. The failure to proceed with the completion of the M50, the failure to build Luas and the total neglect of areas in the northside and the west of the city in relation to traffic management has left us in the sorry state in which we now find ourselves.</P>
      <P>The constant division of responsibilities at national and local level has not helped matters. In the previous Government it was the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment who took the fundamental decision about Operation Freeflow, not the city manager or the assistant city manager for traffic. We have had the Dublin Transport Initiative, the Dublin Transportation Office and now the Director of Traffic, but there has not been a clear line of command over that time. I hope that problem has been rectified to some extent by the establishment of the Office of the Director of Traffic.</P>
      <P>I commend the Director of Traffic on some of the initiatives he has taken, including the maintenance of Operation Freeflow, the success of clamping, which is painful for many drivers, the vast increase of funding from parking flowing into the city coffers, the development of environmental traffic cells to make the city centre more pedestrian and cyclist friendly, and the radial cycle network which the Labour Party proposed ten years ago. All these measures deserve much credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us living on the northside are unhappy with the implementation by the Director of Traffic of several of the projects, in particular the Malahide quality bus route which many people believe did not involve sufficient consultation with local interests. Not only does the project not work on certain stretches of the route, it is dangerous. We have been promised traffic safety audits by the Director of Traffic for the past six or nine months but so far he has failed to publish even one. There appears to be a question to answer in relation to the implementation of that <Col N="253" /> project. The director developed two of these busways without securing from Government the necessary increases in the number of buses, as called for this evening by our Fine Gael colleagues. I hope this necessary infrastructure is brought forward as soon as possible, particularly in relation to the provision of buses.</P>
    <P>Many of the ideas in the motion before the House are commendable. I remember looking at the real time schedule at bus stops in France ten years ago. It was helpful to know the bus was on the way. Integrated ticketing, reverse and contraflow and the other measures Deputy Yates proposes are commendable and we should support them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Director of Traffic launched his own radio station which I understand will give us daily 12-hour reports on traffic throughout Dublin, with music during the night hours. While that is generally welcome he will have to ensure that the traffic moves in the first place. It is not difficult to know where the backlog is but we need to know exactly what is happening in terms of the traffic.</P>
    <P>The director recently approved the erection of 75 ft. camera towers throughout the city without planning permission. I asked the architect of the millennium monument for Dublin if he was inspired by those edifices but apparently he was not. These towers appear to give the Director of Traffic a superb view of what is happening across the city.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion. I do not see Minister O'Rourke and Minister Dempsey delivering on the short-term action plan but if they do not, the result will be disastrous for the citizens of Dublin over the next four or five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the Fine Gael motion on transport. Transport is not my area of expertise but I want to articulate the deep sense of grievance felt by the long-suffering commuters in my constituency. Every morning on AA Roadwatch there is a special report on the difficulties at Knocklyon, Clondalkin, the Naas Road&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Even I know of the Firhouse Road from AA Roadwatch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and, as Deputy Yates said, the Firhouse Road in particular. After housing, the transport crisis is now arguably the biggest problem confronting the Government. No other Minister, apart from Minister O'Rourke, would get away with it. There does not seem to be any emergency measures being contemplated by the Minister to deal with the problem that is affecting daily commuters from most parts of Dublin but in particular from the part of Dublin to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the money is available. The point has been well made that in terms of a projected budget surplus of almost £1,500 million, it is no <Col N="254" /> longer a question of us being unable to afford to deal with this question. What is missing is the political will and it seems we cannot afford not to deal with it because, in terms of the overall performance of the economy, this is now a barrier to continued progress. That is the seriousness of the matter.</P>
    <P>Every morning people are struggling to get to work from the Firhouse and Knocklyon areas and from parts of Tallaght and Clondalkin they endure misery, yet there is no sign from the Government that it is a crisis. The Minister missed the boat on Luas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>She sank the boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>She sank the boat on Luas. I understand Luas in Irish means speed; it certainly does not mean speed in so far as Minister O'Rourke is concerned. We lost the European funds to support the Luas project. The Minister reopened the entire project at a time when the matters she wanted to examine had already been thoroughly examined, and now people are told that the Luas project will come in its own good time. That is not good enough in terms of the difficulties being experienced by people trying to get to and from work in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to come in here and say it is a matter for Dublin Bus. That is the downside of creating quangos because the Minister of the day will say it is a management or an operational issue and that we better talk to Dublin Bus. I have been talking to Dublin Bus. For example, will the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, who is now in the House, tell us about the new estates he used to represent off the Ballycullen Road? They are desperate for any form of public transport. The No. 49 bus does not go as far as those estates. A creative managerial decision by Dublin Bus would provide them with a minimal public transport system. More people are being invited to use their cars and every morning the roads are congested.</P>
      <P>The argument about the third bridge across the Dodder is a major one but it is one that is now behind us. Obviously, those on one side of the river take a particular view but if the traffic is due to go through the residential areas on the other side, the people in those areas will have a different view. The question now is: how quickly can the Government provide the money to build that bridge quickly? </P>
      <P>Similarly, why do the plans for Luas not cross the Tallaght bypass to Old Bawn and Killinarden? That is imperative because that is where the population is concentrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 27 April 1999, on behalf of the Government, I signed an agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom to establish an independent commission for the location of victims' remains. The establishment of this commission followed signals from Sinn Féin that actions of the kind now being taken by both Governments would facilitate the recovery of the remains of victims of violence. This is an important and worthwhile development. For the community in Northern Ireland as a whole, it represents another step in the ongoing process of healing within and between communities. It also brings us a step closer to ending the serious injustice which has long been endured by the families who have been denied information about the burial place of their loved ones.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the Good Friday Agreement specifically provided that it was essential to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation. In this context, the Bill before the House will help to bring to an end another sad chapter in the troubled history of this island.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it is necessary to bring a measure of this nature before the House. The Bill has one purpose, to provide a framework to facilitate the location of the remains of victims. It sets out to do no more and no less than what is necessary to facilitate that process. It is important to say without equivocation, because there has been some confusion on this point, that this Bill does not contain an amnesty in respect of any offence. Instead what is at issue is excluding the use by the prosecution of evidence resulting from the process for which the Bill provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To those who harbour misgivings about the limited immunities which are provided for, I say that the road to peace and reconciliation is never an easy one, and every section of society must be <Col N="256" /> prepared to compromise if we are to achieve our objectives of peace, harmony and mutual respect on this island. It would have been preferable if the need for this legislation had never arisen. However, government often involves making difficult decisions in the face of competing concerns. In this instance, without this legislation and the agreement, the location of the remains of the victims might never be revealed and the families of the victims would be faced with the additional pain and suffering of not knowing where the remains of their loved ones are. Humanity and compassion surely dictate that if there is an opportunity to lessen that pain and suffering, we must do all we can to seize that opportunity.</P>
    <P>By necessity, the timetable for the passage of this legislation is relatively tight. In this context, I acknowledge in particular the co-operation of the Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Flanagan and Howlin, in having the matter debated this evening. They share my concern for the feelings of the families of the victims. Above all else, we should try to lessen their suffering by passing this Bill as quickly as is prudently possible, thereby facilitating the recovery of the remains &ndash; nothing less will suffice.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an independent international commission, as established under the agreement between the Irish and British Governments, signed on 27 April 1999, to facilitate the location of the remains of victims of paramilitary violence killed prior to 10 April 1998. The date 10 April 1998 is an appropriate date given that it was the date of the Good Friday Agreement. Against this background, the Bill provides that the functions and membership of the commission shall be as set out in articles 3 and 4 of the agreement; for a prohibition on the use of evidence resulting from the process and for the confidentiality of information provided to the commission in relation to the process; and for immunities and privileges etc. relating to the commission.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is as follows. On 29 March 1999 the Government approved the draft text of a statement to be issued concerning an initiative to locate the graves of missing people from Northern Ireland. That statement indicated that the Government was prepared to facilitate a process in relation to the locating of the remains through introducing legislation to the effect that evidence resulting from that process could not be used in the prosecution of offences. Shortly afterwards the Provisional IRA issued a statement to the effect that it had succeeded in locating the remains of nine victims. Lengthy and detailed discussions have taken place with the UK authorities with a view to putting in place a framework for the process of locating the remains of victims. This culminated in the signing of the agreement on April 27. It is only right to place on record my personal appreciation for the personal and tireless interest taken by the Secretary of State for <Col N="257" /> Northern Ireland in making progress on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of a commission and specifies that the objective of the commission shall be to facilitate the location of the remains of victims. The commission shall consist of not fewer than two members to be appointed jointly by the two Governments. There are standard provisions relating to appointments, procedures etc. and the provision to the commission of such moneys, premises, facilities and services, including staff, as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that evidence resulting from the process shall not be admissible by or on behalf of the prosecution in proceedings for an offence. It also provides for a similar bar on forensic testing to that contained in the Decommissioning Act but testing will be allowed to the extent that such testing is necessary, for inquest purposes, to establish the identity of the victim and how, when and where he or she died, or to determine whether an item can be safely moved or otherwise dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Bill places an obligation on the commission to maintain confidentiality in relation to the information disclosed to it. This is a central provision in the Bill. However, there is a provision which would allow, at the discretion of the commission, the family of a victim to be told that information has been given to the commission relating to the location of the remains of the victim and the place where, according to the information, the remains may be found. The Bill also provides for immunities etc. in relation to the commission. There is also provision for the issue of search warrants to the Garda Síochána on the basis of certificates provided by the commission that the remains of a victim are likely to be found at a particular place.</P>
    <P>As regards the Freedom of Information Act, it is envisaged, for obvious reasons, that there would be no question of the Minister for Finance making an order the effect of which would be to make the commission a public body to which that Act would apply. However, it is necessary to amend the Freedom of Information Act to ensure that information provided by the commission to public bodies, or from public bodies to the commission, can be fully protected. The Bill also contains standard provisions relating to the submission of reports by the commission, the dissolution of the commission when it is considered no longer necessary for it to remain in being, expenses, short title and commencement.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with each section of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision providing for certain necessary definitions. In particular, &ldquo;victim of violence&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it in article 3(3)(a) of the agreement, namely &ldquo;persons killed before 10 April 1998 as a result of acts committed on behalf of, or in connection with, an <Col N="258" /> unlawful organisation&rdquo;. An &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo; is defined in article 3(3)(b) of the agreement as an unlawful organisation within the meaning of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, in respect of which a suppression order has been made, or an organisation proscribed for the purposes of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will have the legal capacity of a body corporate. This is in line with article 2 of the agreement. Section 3 provides that the objective and functions of the commission, referred to in section 1 as &ldquo;the process&rdquo;, are as set out in article 3 of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The objective of the commission is to facilitate the location of the remains of victims of violence. The functions of the commission are: to receive information relating to the location of the remains of such victims; to disclose such information for the purpose of facilitating the location of remains to which the information relates; and to report on its activities to both Governments no later than one year after its establishment and annually thereafter.</P>
    <P>The membership and terms of appointment of the commission and the appointment of staff shall be as set out in article 4 of the agreement. The commission shall have not fewer than two members appointed jointly by the two Governments. The two Governments may, if they so wish, jointly appoint one of the members to act as chairperson. The terms and conditions of the members will be determined by the two Governments. The commission may appoint staff to assist in the discharge of its functions on such terms and conditions as the commission, with the agreement of the two Governments, may determine.</P>
    <P>In line with article 8 of the agreement, the commission will be required to keep proper accounts and, at the request of the two Governments, will appoint auditors who shall audit its accounts. Section 4 will enable the Minister to provide to the commission such moneys, premises, facilities and services, including staff, as may be necessary for the proper functioning of the commission. This is in line with article 6 of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that any evidence obtained, directly or indirectly, whether inside or outside the State, resulting from the process, shall not be admissible on behalf of the prosecution in any criminal proceedings. Neither will any evidence resulting from a test or examination carried out for the purpose of establishing, for the purposes of an inquest, the identity of a victim, or how, when and where he or she died. In addition, any evidence resulting from a test or procedure the purpose of which is to determine whether an item found can safely be moved or otherwise dealt with, will also be inadmissible. Tests or forensic examinations on any substance or thing found <Col N="259" /> resulting from the process for any other purposes shall not be permitted.</P>
    <P>Section 6, in line with article 7 of the agreement, provides that no information provided to the commission in relation to the process shall be disclosed to any person except for the purpose of facilitating the location of the remains to which the information relates. However, the commission may disclose or arrange for the disclosure to members of the victim's family that information has been provided to the commission relating to the location of the remains of the victim and the place, where, according to that information, the remains may be found. Needless to say, ensuring the confidentiality of information provided to the commission is an essential requirement in the process.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister may, by order, make provision to the effect that the commission, its property and certain persons, as set out in the section, shall be afforded certain immunities and privileges etc. This is in line with article 5 of the agreement. Such provision is considered necessary given that the proposed commission will be an international body and given the need to ensure that the commission can give absolute assurances about maintaining confidentiality in relation to information provided to it. There is a similar provision in respect of the Decommissioning Commission in the 1997 Decommissioning Act. An order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after such an order is made. The order may be annulled if a resolution to that effect is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days after the order has been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a search warrant may be issued by a Judge of the District Court if satisfied that the commission has certified that the remains of a victim are likely to be found in a particular place or premises. A person who obstructs a Garda acting under the authority of a search warrant will be guilty of an offence and if convicted shall be liable to a fine of up to £1,500 and or imprisonment for a period of up to six months.</P>
    <P>Section 9 proposes an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act would not apply to the commission itself as it is not intended that the Minister for Finance would make an order declaring it to be a public body under the Act. There is, however, as I have already explained, a need to protect communications between the commission and public bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Freedom of Information Act, subject to certain safeguards, allows for the issue of a ministerial certificate to the effect that applications for disclosure of certain information may be refused because the record is exempt under <Col N="260" /> section 23 or section 24 of that Act. The Bill provides that the same FOI regime would apply to communications between public bodies and the commission as applies to other sensitive information currently covered under sections 23 and 24 of the Freedom of Information Act. In effect this would mean that such information will be subject to the same regime which applies to information such as sensitive security information and information affecting relations with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a member, or a member of staff of the commission, or a person performing functions assigned to him or her by the commission, or an agent of the commission, shall not be required to attend an inquest in relation to any matter within his or her knowledge resulting from the process. This provision is considered necessary in the context of assuring confidentiality in relation to information supplied to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the Minister may, after consultation with the Secretary of State, dissolve the commission, in line with article 10 of the agreement. In doing so, the Minister may provide for such transitional or consequential provisions as appear to him or her to be expedient. Thus, it would be possible to wind down the commission in a manner which would allow for the meeting of any liabilities and for the disposal of any remaining assets of the commission in an orderly manner. Sections 12 and 13 are standard provisions providing for payment of expenses arising under the Act, the short title, and commencement.</P>
    <P>The troubles on this island over the past 30 years or so have given rise to thousands of victims and it would be invidious to compare the levels of suffering endured by any one group or community. However, I believe there is a widespread acceptance that the plight of the families of victims whose remains have not yet been recovered has been an especially harrowing one.</P>
    <P>The Government is confident that the Bill, following on the agreement signed last Wednesday, taken together with the similar legislation which is being put through the British Parliament, will encourage those who may have information about the secret burial places of victims to make that information known to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. The Government believes, that providing this information is no more than justice and basic humanity require and deserve.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive and informed debate. I thank the Opposition spokespersons for their co-operation and all who helped make this day possible, especially Deputy Currie who has expressed an interest in this matter in this House and elsewhere over many years. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will not oppose this extraordinary Bill. This is not legislation which can be enthusiastically or warmly welcomed. It is only with the greatest reluctance that such legislation should ever be contemplated or enacted by a democratic Parliament. Murder is the most fundamental crime of all. The basis of our criminal law is that criminals, particularly those convicted of committing serious crime, will be tracked down, brought to trial, charged, convicted and obliged to face the consequences of their crime in open court and prison thereafter. This legislation runs counter to any normal understanding of the nature of justice.</P>
      <P>The republican movement has shown a wanton disregard of the basic human rights of the disappeared people of Northern Ireland. They were abducted, in many cases tortured, and then murdered on the whim of self-appointed judges. In many cases lies and malicious propaganda were spread to blacken their names. In the final inhuman indignity, their bodies were dumped in unmarked graves. This is the greatest shame of all on the republican movement.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin and the IRA place great emphasis on their dead. Funerals, graveside orations and the remembrance of their dead are central to republican ideology. It is part of human nature to want to bury our dead and bring a certain closure to the grief of relatives. Shame on the IRA and Sinn Féin who have for so long refused to grant to others what they so loudly demand for themselves.</P>
      <P>That the IRA is only now considering the possibility of identifying where these bodies are buried is due to the unwavering persistence of the relatives of the disappeared and the determination shown by many public figures, not least my colleague, Deputy Currie, who has consistently pursued this matter with vigour. There are considerations surrounding the issue of the disappeared people which have a wider application in Northern Ireland and warrant further debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has suited the political agenda of many people to blur the difference between the victims of violence and the perpetrators of violence and to portray all who were involved in violence as victims. We should be clear on where we stand. There is no moral equivalence between the perpetrators of violence and the victims of violence. To try to make such an equivalence is a further violation of and insult to victims. A great deal more thoughtful consideration should be given to how the needs of victims of violence might be more adequately catered for. It is important that the surviving victims of violence be given the <Col N="262" /> opportunity to record their experiences and their loss. Their stories need to be told and heard.</P>
    <P>Some variation on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission might have some application on this island. There seems to be a compelling human need to establish the truth and the facts surrounding particular events. This is why the new inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday is welcome and why we should consider a new inquiry into the events surrounding the Monaghan and Dublin bombings. Perhaps such a new inquiry is necessary in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the most positive and active consideration be given to establishing, by way of independent inquiry, allegations of RUC collusion or acts of omission on the part of the police force in relation to the deaths of solicitors, Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. Establishing facts and reaching some truth has a redemptive quality, which should not be underestimated. It is better to face the possibility or reality of collusion and cover up, rather than allow the poison of suspicion to fester and infect.</P>
    <P>The material, physical and psychological well being of the surviving victims must be higher on the political agenda. As part of the Good Friday Agreement we have seen the rapid release of many prisoners who committed appalling acts of violence. They are now free, while many of their victims carry a life sentence from which death will be the only release. The time has come for the Irish Government to make a significant annual contribution to victim support organisations in Northern Ireland. This could be done in consultation with the Northern Ireland Office and would be a welcome sign of our commitment to the necessary long-term policies of conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the Minister stated, is something which we, as democratic politicians, must consider, albeit reluctantly, as necessary. Section 5 is a most extraordinary section. The Minister referred in his speech to limited immunity and said this is not a blanket amnesty. We might consider this matter in some detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also refer to the composition of the commission. It has been reported that a person such as Sir Kenneth Bloomfield may be considered a likely chairman of the commission. Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to inform the House before the debate concludes of the Irish membership of the commission. Consideration might be given to the nomination of the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, given his role in regard to the position of victims. The legislation states the composition of the commission shall be not less than two, but it does not state how many it should be. Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on the number of members of the commission.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects which we must consider. Given the extraordinary nature of this <Col N="263" /> legislation, perhaps we should consider a repeal date upon which this legislation will become defunct, annulled or repealed. I see no reason a time frame, such as a year, might not be placed on the legislation. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of the process which we have become accustomed to terming &ldquo;conflict resolution&rdquo;. Another vital element must be a clear unequivocal statement from the IRA that its campaign of violence is over for good. The Republican movement, as a whole, must commit itself to the exclusive use of peaceful means to bring about political change. The guns and weapons of violence must be silenced and put out of commission to the satisfaction of the international decommissioning body. The new political dispensation, which is outlined in the Good Friday Agreement, means Republicans must now leave the armalite firmly behind and depend solely on their strength at the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The road to conflict resolution must be ongoing dialogue based on mutual respect. We are all aware of the duration and intensity of effort required to arrive at the Good Friday Agreement. We are all very conscious of the difficulty surrounding particular issues, such as Drumcree, which have taken on a symbolic status. I give a warm welcome to the recent initiative on Drumcree. Elected representatives have a central and crucial role to play in conflict resolution and their efforts must be supported in every possible way.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Northern Ireland situation and Drumcree which demand intense dialogue by other organisations. I refer here to the sectarian undertones of the Northern Ireland conflict. This sectarianism spills into the open at Drumcree at Harryville and in the frequent arson attacks on churches and other places of worship and the regular sectarian attacks on individuals and family homes. The Christian churches on our two islands need to address more forthrightly the history of sectarianism and its current day manifestations.</P>
    <P>Just as the people of Ireland were prepared to make fundamental changes in our political systems, including constitutional changes of a profound nature last May, so also should the Christian churches take a deep look at their basic documents and current practices, with a view to confronting sectarianism. The Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian traditions need to undergo a deeper process of reconciliation. No Christian tradition should define itself in opposition to another tradition or question the integrity of the deep traditions of faith held sincerely by another.</P>
    <P>Christianity is not a political force and Christian churches need to be careful about being identified with particular traditions. Perhaps, the <Col N="264" /> heads of all the Christian traditions on these islands might consider a deeper programme of reflection which might, in time, lead to formal public ceremonies of forgiveness and reconciliation. Armagh, the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland, would be an appropriate location for such a programme of work and for public rituals of reconciliation between the various Christian traditions.</P>
    <P>At times such as the present, the political process surrounding Northern Ireland seems to be agonisingly slow. If we are ever tempted to falter we should look back and see what has already been accomplished. The achievements of the past five years are both substantial and real. The prospects for the future, despite present hurdles and difficulties, are also very bright.</P>
    <P>Later this week we will see the election of a new parliament in Scotland and a new assembly in Wales. We are on the threshold of a new, exciting, dynamic matrix of relationships between all the peoples of our two islands.</P>
    <P>Although this legislation may be particularly hard to accept, we are willing to do so for the greater good. At the same time, however, we must not be tempted to forget or ignore the concerns of victims. Attention to the well-being of victims, in all its aspects, must be a central element in the evolving peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Hallowe'en night 1975 a young man, Columba McVeigh, from my home village, left his flat in Dolphin's Barn, in this city and jurisdiction. He told his girlfriend he was just popping out for a few moments to buy a packet of cigarettes. He took nothing with him, apart from the clothes he was wearing. He never came back; he disappeared. He left behind in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, a father, mother, two brothers and a sister. Their long purgatory began that Hallowe'en night. They never gave up hoping there was some explanation other than the obvious one. When his father died a few years ago the obituary notice in the local newspapers and the <i>Irish News</i> included Columba's name among the grieving relatives. What better testimony could there be to a family which had not given up hope?</P>
      <P>I welcome the possibility that at last his body is to receive a Christian burial and that his relatives will have a focus for their grieving. I have been pursuing this matter for many years. If the Minister checks the relevant file in his Department he will see the record of the representations I have made since shortly after Columba's disappearance in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the possibility that the body is to be recovered and to receive a Christian burial, at this stage I share the scepticism expressed by some of the relatives. After 24 years I will only believe it when I stand in Donaghmore graveyard <Col N="265" /> and see the mortal remains of Columba lowered into the family grave, it having been certified by DNA testing or some other method that they are his mortal remains.</P>
    <P>I give no credit to the IRA. Even in pre-Christian times, bodies were returned on the cessation of hostilities. These people considered themselves barbarous and in many respects we also consider them barbarous. However, at least they had the humanity to return their opponents' bodies. In this case, the original murderous act has been compounded by a quarter of a century of inhumanity.</P>
    <P>Four years ago, in a controversial edition of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, I put this point to the president of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams. Under pressure, he promised on that occasion that he would ensure the bodies were returned, but the hopes raised among the relatives at that time festered some time ago. The recent IRA statement added insult to injury. The IRA took these people's lives and then attempted to take away their reputations. Columba McVeigh was branded an informer by the IRA in its recent statement. He was 17 years of age when this started. The British army raided the family home and a cigarette packet was found in Columba's room. It contained two or three bullets, no doubt planted by the security forces. Columba McVeigh told me the story and that is what he and his family believed.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, this young man of 17 years was caught between the British army and the RUC on the one hand and the IRA on the other. When he was remanded to Crumlin Road prison for the alleged possession of these bullets, he was subjected to considerable intimidation and interrogation. Many questions remain as to what happened when he came out with the people on whom he relied and from whom he sought assistance, what advice they gave him and why they gave it.</P>
    <P>He was an innocent young man. I knew him, his parents, brothers and sister. They are still my friends. Perhaps &ldquo;naive&rdquo; is a better word to describe him. At 17 years of age he was murdered and now he is to be branded an informer. Whatever evidence the IRA had must have been of the flimsiest nature. That is also the case with regard to the evidence upon which a number of other disappeared people were sentenced to be executed. Who murdered them? Who were the individuals who abducted Columba in this city, probably from the local pub he frequented to buy his cigarettes? I cannot be sure although I have my suspicions. There have been persistent rumours over the years and I believe I know who was responsible.</P>
    <P>Even more important, who sanctioned his murder? Who sanctioned the murder of the other disappeared people? People who know about the workings of the IRA are aware that murders of alleged informers required sanction from the <Col N="266" /> topof that organisation. I believe I know and the Minister has a good idea who was responsible for sanctioning the murder of Columba McVeigh and others like him. When I see this leading member of Sinn Féin appear on television looking as if butter would not melt in his mouth and when I read reports of his graveside orations over the graves of the martyred dead, I feel nauseated. That individual has a terrible responsibility on his conscience, if he has a conscience.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the people responsible for these murders would get off scot free. I welcome the Minister's assurance that there is not to be an amnesty. However, I am a realist. The passing of this legislation will reduce considerably the chances of those responsible ever being made amenable to justice. That is the reality. I do not like that. Those responsible should pay for their murderous inhumanity and I hope they will some day, either in this life or the next.</P>
    <P>We must pass this legislation in order to have these bodies returned to their relatives and to ensure they are given a Christian burial. The relatives will be able to go to the local churchyard and will have a focus for their grieving. All uncertainty in relation to the fate of the disappeared will be removed. That is something worthwhile which I have pursued for a considerable period of time. Therefore, I must recognise the reality and agree with the Minister's response to people such as I who harbour misgivings about this legislation. He said the road to peace and reconciliation is never an easy one and every section of society must be prepared to compromise if the objectives of peace, harmony and mutual respect are to be achieved on this island. I accept that. I think of the relatives of the victims whose murderers have been released and are walking freely in the community. I know the pain that causes but that is part of the price we must pay.</P>
    <P>Nine bodies are due to be returned. What about the other seven who are classified as disappeared and about whom the IRA says it will not provide information? The IRA has a responsibility to make known the information it has. Even if the IRA claims it is not responsible, it should know from its investigations what conclusions were reached and what information it has about these bodies. Perhaps by some other method we might be able to get the necessary information for these relatives so they too can retrieve the bodies of their loved ones.</P>
    <P>I noted there was no reference to Captain Nirac who was captured in south Armagh. There have been rumours over the years about what happened to his body. The fact that no information is forthcoming about the whereabouts of his body might confirm those rumours. There is no denying it was carried out by republicans. There is a responsibility on them to let us know what happened to his body and to be as helpful as possible. Is that asking too much from people <Col N="267" /> who have indicated in so many ways their total inhumanity?</P>
    <P>I hope there is no further delay in this matter. Let us conclude this sad and inhuman saga as quickly as possible. There should be no more drawn out suffering for the relatives, no excuses for not providing the information quickly, no excuses in relation to this legislation and no excuses on any other matter. That is the least we should demand.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation because I am a realist but I do so reluctantly for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe to the description of this legislation as extraordinary. Most people in this House find it distasteful. As parliamentarians, we are not used to creating a framework in such sad circumstances so that those responsible for heinous acts are less likely to be called to account.</P>
      <P>We, on the Labour benches, have always fully supported the legislative programme on Northern Ireland of this and previous Governments. We do so because we see it as a consensus pathway to the ultimate goal of peace. Many of the steps on that tortuous path are unpleasant and unpalatable but necessary. We supported the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act which put in clear terms the Good Friday Agreement. We supported the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, which provides for the early release of convicted prisoners. This did not bring great joy on either side of the House. We supported the legislation introduced following the Omagh bombing, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, because of the need, which was clearly recognised by all sides in the House, for the tightest possible security measures, some of which were difficult for libertarians to support. We supported the British-Irish Agreement Act to facilitate the establishment of North-South bodies.</P>
      <P>All these were confidence building measures by the State in its contribution to a framework for peace. It is clear that responsibility for building this framework within which peace can survive and flourish rests with more than the State. All the parties to the Agreement, political and otherwise, must play their role in creating a society where peace can flourish and thrive. Each must see what they can do to build the confidence on which that fragile flower can grow and flourish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to listen to a contribution, such as that of Deputy Currie, and not be moved. The concept of the disappeared is brought into reality when one talks about specific instances and the hurt of a family traumatised not only by a killing but by the absence of knowledge and a body. It is sickening beyond belief that not only would they <Col N="268" /> deprive the family of a loved one of the body but that they would go to extraordinary lengths to discredit the memory of that loved one. It is incumbent on the IRA and others to reveal the location of all bodies and to do so as soon as these measures are enacted without any more delay or prevarication. It is our hope that this Bill, once enacted, will facilitate that process. It is for that reason alone that we support it.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have read the book by Eamon Collins, <i>Killing Rage</i>, as I did in recent months, gained some insight into the incredible brutality that characterised and characterises membership of a paramilitary organisation. The details of the operations of the so-called nutting squad, the internal security wing of the IRA who took it upon themselves, while the political wing of the IRA was talking about due process and fairness in the courts, to provide their own kangaroo courts, instant judgment and sometimes instant death, are chilling and numbing. We all pray that their operational days are over. That is why we work assiduously to put in place a legal framework which will allow peace not only to gain root but to thrive.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 5 are the Bill's core sections. Section 3 outlines the functions of the commission &ndash; to receive information relating to the location of the remains of victims; to disclose such information for the purpose of facilitating the location of remains to which the information relates; and to report on its activities to both Governments not later than one year after its establishment and annually thereafter.</P>
    <P>Membership of the commission will not be fewer than two. My view is that it should be greater than two. Some of the names mentioned in the briefings provided to Fine Gael and myself, on behalf of the Labour Party, were welcome and I wholeheartedly accept and recommend some of the names mentioned casually in those discussions. However, I am concerned that it would be seen to be independent, inspire confidence and have a membership greater than two. I appreciate the detailed briefing we received which allowed us to facilitate this early Second Stage reading and, I hope, early enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two important related matters of which I hope the Minister will take note to ensure early progress. One is the issue of people who have been exiled from their communities by the paramilitaries. These kangaroo courts, when they did not have the ultimate sanction of death sentences, liberally provided their own apartheid system and had internal exile. People who have been exiled from their communities by such paramilitaries must be allowed return home. It is incumbent on the paramilitaries to remove all threats from these people and allow them return to their families. When the Minister is in dialogue, either directly or through intermediaries, <Col N="269" /> with the political representatives of the paramilitary organisations or those associated with them I hope this matter will be raised. Not only have they a moral responsibility to return to the families of the bereaved the bodies of their loved ones but they also have a responsibility to the living to allow those whom they have exiled, for whatever reason, to return without threat to their communities and their families.</P>
    <P>The other category I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister are British soldiers who deserted from the British army and fled into this jurisdiction during the currency of the troubles. Many of those people live here in this jurisdiction under assumed names and cannot return to Britain for fear of being arrested and imprisoned as deserters. These people deserve an amnesty. I hope the Government will raise this issue with the British authorities and the British Ministry of Defence to ensure they too, for whatever reason they could not endure life as a British soldier in Northern Ireland, will be allowed return to some semblance of normality, as we build what is described as some semblance of normality for all the families so viciously wounded in so many ways by the ongoing troubles and conflicts.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is the people's agreement and it must be implemented in all its aspects. I avail of the opportunity of this debate to make a point with which I think most people in the House will agree. A movement on arms, a movement on decommissioning is not a sign of surrender, it is a sign of strength. Everybody in the House wants to see decommissioning. Sinn Féin has made it clear it thinks the current climate is difficult. Unfortunately, it went further in its direct dialogue with my party and the Fine Gael party some months ago when it said decommissioning would never happen. I hope that was a bargaining position, that it will decommission and is using its good offices with the IRA to ensure decommissioning happens. We want the climate for decommissioning to be right and are willing to facilitate the creation of the right climate but there must be movement.</P>
    <P>The British Government can play its role. The demand for further demilitarisation, the removal of soldiers from the streets and a return to normality would help. The ultimate responsibility must rest with those who have arms to participate in the totality of the Good Friday Agreement which negates the need for arms. Since there is no need for them they can surely begin the process of handing them up.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this Bill. We would rather it was not necessary but it is necessary. Section 5 will make it more difficult for those who are guilty of the most awful acts to evade accountability and it may bring solace and an end to the torture of those families who have been deprived of their loved ones for years and <Col N="270" /> in some cases many decades. For that reason the Labour Party supports it.</P>
    <P>Step by step all the parties of this Oireachtas will build a wall of peace. We will help and contribute in any way we can. If that common endeavour is to be successful it will require the participation of all parties, all people of good will, to ensure this measure to bring comfort, will be one of the final legislative measures required to establish a lasting and permanent peace in this land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that a parliament such as ours has to pass such legislation. As other speakers have said the prize of peace is a huge task for the various parties which compose this House. I am pleased to acknowledge the great role played by Members in supporting the peace process. It has been an article of faith among political parties that there is an element of bi-partisanship of unity and agreement when it comes to the peace process. That has been more honoured than dishonoured here. It is also important to be careful in the use of language when debating Bills such as this and other matters in the peace process. There is an awful visceral emotion that underlies the conflict that has affected this island for hundreds of years but particularly in the past 25 years. Resort to violence has been one of he worst features of Irish history.</P>
      <P>It is important that people in responsible positions, such as ourselves, are careful and rational in our approach to issues such as this. I am pleased there is all-party support for it.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that these missing people and their families have suffered enormous pain. They come from different social strata and different backgrounds and all have suffered. They are not unlike people the Minister has dealt with in his Department. The Garda Síochána is now taking a more pro-active role on missing persons. While people do not know the whereabouts of their relatives they know something awful has happened to them. This is humane legislation which deals in a practical way with a problem that has arisen because we are building a peace process which we hope will lead to uniting people in a spirit of co-operation and friendship, North and South, regardless of religions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Currie spoke most movingly on this point. He has represented people in the Six Counties and has been a victim of violence and speaks with great authority on this subject. What has happened in the past 25 or 26 years has been an exceedingly dirty low-intensity war. I use the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; carefully. It has not been nice.  As a youngster in 1966 I recall asking my grandfather who was proud to have played a part in the struggle for Irish freedom in the period 1918-22 what he did. He was shot in the Civil War and still carried the bullets. His reply was remarkable and, <Col N="271" /> as always, consistent. He refused to speak about it and described it as a dirty war. He did not do anything in that period of which he was particularly proud. It is important to acknowledge that the use of violence is not ennobling. It has been presented romantically in some republican circles as ennobling but that is not the case. It disables people and the society in which it happens.</P>
    <P>The war conducted over 25 years since 1969 was dirty on all sides. It is important to not only concentrate on this Bill because it was also dirty on the state sides in the South and the North of Ireland. As the ultimate peace we all seek comes tantalisingly closer, the location of the bodies of the disappeared will hopefully be revealed, but the horrible collusive nature of the relationship between some elements of the police force in the North with loyalist death squads is also coming to the surface. This is an appalling exhibition of what went on in the Six Counties statelet. It is essentially dysfunctional and it has spread its dysfunctionality to this State.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Howlin said, parties and individuals have compromised some of our basic values in terms of the libertarian agenda and the basic rights of people when they are arrested, taken into custody and brought before the courts. We are not proud of that, and we should not be proud of it. However, it had to be done because there were difficult and dangerous times over the 26 years.</P>
    <P>I believe the IRA is serious in relation to recovering the bodies of the disappeared. I agree with Deputy Currie that the body of Captain Nirac would be an important symbol of the process. Captain Nirac, who obviously was involved in covert operations, was killed in a nasty and deliberate manner. It would be a great confidence gesture if the IRA returned his body in advance of the implementation of the Bill to show its good faith. I hope that is done. The organisation has shown some good faith to date in terms of bringing this matter to the fore and returning bodies where possible. I received representations from England in relation to Captain Nirac and I was informed that there was a will to return his body some time ago. Unfortunately, it met the rock of resistance of certain IRA units in the south Armagh area who were not keen on the idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a body to return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from my basic and superficial inquiries that there is a body to return. I hope that is the case because British army personnel also suffered and were victims in this process although Nationalists and republicans do not always acknowledge it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that society, including that in the southern state, is steeped in a tradition of glorifying the gun and violence in an inappro<Col N="272" /> priate manner. I recall that some years ago a keen local historian in Tipperary conducted an investigation into what had become local lore in relation to the War of Independence. Approximately 60 or 70 years later, the body of a former member of the British army who resettled in Ireland during that turbulent period was discovered in the woods. He had been shot because he was allegedly an informer. Elderly people in the community remembered the person being shot but nobody spoke about it for almost 70 years. Those people in their declining years only then felt free to comment on and discuss the event with the local historian. A body was then discovered and returned. This is the type of society in which we live. It is a terrible legacy but one to which all parties in the House are committed to eradicating from national life. We want to build closer relationships with our nearest neighbour, Britain.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for the establishment of an international commission to supervise this distasteful business. Some lessons could be learned from this in relation to decommissioning and the inquiry into the horrible and brutal murder of Mrs. Rosemary Nelson. I suggest to the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government that we consider instituting an investigative process into that killing which extends to an international rather than a local level. There is huge distrust of the state security and police force in the Six Counties and this must be acknowledged. It is inappropriate to have members of the RUC investigating this murder given the allegations and accusations which have been made. Reservations have been expressed in the US Congress about the use of the FBI's name in this process. It is not convinced that it is proper and appropriate for the FBI to be involved in a minor way. It feels the FBI should have a bigger involvement if it is to stand over the investigation.</P>
    <P>The main point of this debate is to ensure the Bill is passed quickly and its provisions implemented to allow bodies to be returned to their loved ones. It is horrible that the people concerned have had to wait so long. It is a terrible comment to make in the Parliament of a free Ireland, that we cannot give those people justice. They did not receive a fair trial and they will never get one. The issue will never be resolved. This relates to other conflicts, such as that in South Africa where it was decided to establish a truth commission but I do not believe such a commission would serve this country well. It served South Africa reasonably well and people said in a more effusive period that such a body would be helpful here. However, Ireland is too small an island for such a body. We need to concentrate on reconciliation and practical measures such as the Bill. There is a concentration on openness and transparency in almost all areas of public life and elsewhere now, but it would not be <Col N="273" /> appropriate in this area. It is a dirty period in our history and it should be left to the historians.</P>
    <P>Extraordinary steps have been taken by political leaders on all sides in this conflict, including the IRA, Sinn Féin, the loyalist paramilitaries and various Governments. Deputy John Bruton produced the Framework Document, Deputy Albert Reynolds produced the Downing Street Declaration and the Taoiseach finessed the Good Friday Agreement. Every major party and some smaller organisations have played their part in building the process and this is a great source of confidence in it which will continue.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary images in recent years in this process was Dr. Mo Mowlam walking into one of Her Majesty's prisons and negotiating directly with people whom the British Government regarded as terrorists and criminals. Dr. Mowlam was criticised and denigrated for it and the move was regarded as complete appeasement. It was an act of utter abnegation and appeasement. The fact that an elected Government which claims sovereignty over a particular piece of ground negotiated directly with their own prison inmates on developing a peace process is without parallel. It was a courageous move on Dr. Mowlam's part and that is the type of distasteful but courageous actions which people must take in this process.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for his role. The Minister always gets the bad end of the stick in this process because he is involved in the sensitive area of security.</P>

      <P>The Minister has played a good and strong role in the process in terms of sensitive issues about which one cannot boast. They cannot be highlighted in the press but they involve an intense engagement with the security dimension. The Minister has not played this role in a blinkered way. Some Ministers for Justice let the iron into their soul and became prisoners of what could be termed the security establishment. Some Ministers have a proclivity to not only fall prisoner to that but to luxuriate in the trappings of security, intelligence and other matters. To be fair to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, he has not fallen into that common trap that seems to ensnare Ministers for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to engage in these practical, though distasteful measures. As a journalist I had to meet distasteful people, republican and loyalist paramilitaries, members of the IRA, people who were out to cause mayhem and trouble, people involved in killing. My involvement in covering the peace process led me to becoming involved in <Col N="274" /> politics. The triumph of this process is the triumph of elected representatives pursuing the issue by political means which is the appropriate way to resolve issues. Some elements of the media like to focus on the more ephemeral aspects to the peace process, that somehow it has been a victory for paramilitaries and those previously engaged in violence. It is very important to send out a strong signal that politicians are in charge and peaceful democrats are winning the peace. The people who resorted to violence in the past have come round to our point of view and have come into the middle which we have proudly occupied for a number of years Individuals and parties have played their part in finding new ways of looking at the problem. Dr. Garret FitzGerald started the process with the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, a measure which we in Fianna Fáil wrongly opposed at that time. It is important that I as a member of Fianna Fáil acknowledge that we were wrong and foolish to oppose that agreement, which I suspect was opposed for opportunistic reasons. It is important we acknowledge the role played by Dr. FitzGerald as one of the essential building blocks in building the peace we now have. Measures such as this will build the confidence we need for peace.</P>
    <P>The investigation into the Rosemary Nelson case will be a litmus test for Nationalist confidence in the process in which we are engaged. Nothing gave greater encouragement to those who resorted to violence than the stymied Stalker investigation.  It drew support, moral and actual, to the people who resorted to violence &ndash;  there was a policy of &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; which clearly was not investigated properly.</P>
    <P>I was the only reporter present at a House of Commons' committee and was the first to report Douglas Hogg's injudicious remarks identifying solicitors in Northern Ireland as being very close to paramilitaries and Mr. Seamus Mallon's &ndash; another member of that committee &ndash; condemnation of these remarks. When I heard of the subsequent shooting of Mr. Pat Finnucane, I stood rigid to the spot. I know that Mr. Finnucane's brother has been associated with such organisations.  It requires true democrats to be extremely careful in their use of language in relation to this conflict. A wrong word, allegation or insinuation can lead to people loosing their lives. As we see, a wrong inference or the motive wrongly expressed can lead to further hardening of the hardliners position such as those in South Armagh denying the family of the body of Captain Nirac. We can be reassured that this legislation will not damage our democracy but will build on the peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Flanagan, Howlin, Currie and Conor Lenihan for their con<Col N="275" /> tributions. This is an important Bill and I welcome the tone and content of this constructive debate. As speakers have acknowledged, none more eloquently than Deputy Currie, it is a particular cruelty that families of these victims have for so long been denied information regarding the burial places of their loved ones. One can only imagine the pain and suffering that these families have had to endure during the past three decades. If this Bill and the Agreement can lessen that pain and suffering, surely it is incumbent on this House to move as quickly as is prudently possible on this matter.</P>
      <P>Questions have been raised about how quickly the commission can be established. As the House will appreciate the necessary legislation has to be in force in both jurisdictions before the commission can be established. Progress in this House is mirroring progress in the House of Commons where the equivalent legislation is being debated today. I understand that remaining stages in the House of Commons will be taken this day week and I hope the remaining stages of our legislation will be taken here on the same day. I hope it will prove possible to have all stages of the Bill taken by the Seanad by the end of next week and I understand that it is hoped to have the UK Bill debated in the House of Lords on 17 May. That is the broad timetable of the legislation in both jurisdictions. I can assure the House that I do not envisage any undue delay between the enactment of the legislation in both jurisdictions and the establishment of the commission. To this end discussions are continuing between my officials and officials of the Northern Ireland Office with a view to making the necessary practical arrangements.  In this context I should mention that while the role of the commission is very important, I do not envisage that it will be necessary to put in place terribly elaborate structures to enable it to carry on its work. The main functions of the commission are to receive and impart information. In practical terms where the commission is satisfied that it has information that might lead to the location of the remains of a victim, it will pass this information on to the Garda or RUC who will take the matter from there. Members of the commission will be appointed jointly by both Governments. Final decisions have not yet been taken in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement provides that the commission should have no fewer than two members and I would not envisage a number significantly in excess of two. Consultations are continuing about this and other matters and I envisage decisions being taken in sufficient time in the context of the legislative timetable. It is not possible for me to indicate with any certainty the number of victims of paramilitary violence whose remains have not been located. Figures of the order of 20 have been mentioned but of their very nature such fig<Col N="276" /> ures are speculative. As I mentioned in my opening speech the Provisional IRA has indicated that it has succeeded in locating the remains of nine victims. Separately the IRSP arranged to have information provided about a person murdered in Paris and the French police are pursuing this. That is the only definite information I can give the House. It is important to emphasise that the terms of the Bill apply to the victims of unlawful organisations which are defined in the agreement by reference to organisations proscribed in this jurisdiction under the Offence Against the State Act, 1939 and in the North under their equivalent legislation. This should encompass the victims of any paramilitary organisations which have been active on this island during the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>There are differences of detail between this Bill and the equivalent measure in the UK, but in drafting the Bill and formulating our approach to the matter in general, officials of my Department have worked closely in tandem with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast and the Home Office in London. This was very important given that both Bills must operate in tandem. Naturally, given the differences in law between here and the UK, the wording of the UK legislation will differ in some respects from the wording of our legislation. This is not an important factor. What is important is that even though it may be worded differently, the legislation in both jurisdictions will achieve the same objectives.</P>
    <P>I put on record my deep appreciation for the assistance and co-operation of the official in the Northern Ireland Office and the UK office. In this respect I am very conscious of the work that has been carried out by officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is only right that I acknowledge the deep appreciation which I and the House have for that work, most of which goes unnoticed.</P>
    <P>I can understand the misgivings some may have about certain provisions of the Bill. Let me repeat that it does not offer an amnesty for offences. It provides that evidence resulting either directly or indirectly from the process, whether inside or outside the State, will not be admissible in any criminal proceedings on behalf of the prosecution. This non-admissibility might not be welcomed by everyone but, as has been acknowledged by each contributor to this important debate, without such a prohibition the evidence might never come to light, the victims' bodies might never be found and their families would continue to endure the torment of not knowing the burial place of their loved ones. I think we are all agreed that this cannot be allowed to happen. As I stated earlier, the road to peace and reconciliation is not an easy one. Compromises must be made and balances struck.</P>
    <P>As to the confidentiality of information provided to the commission, there is a provision <Col N="277" /> which allows it to provide some information to the families of the victims, to the extent that they could be told whether information has been provided to the commission relating to the location of a victim's remains and the place where, according to the information, the remains may be found. This will be a matter for the discretion of the commission.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that much was said this evening about the plight of victims' families. This is a particularly difficult time for them, having had their hopes built up that, at long last, the remains of their loved ones can be located. The families are particularly concerned at the possibility of distressing media coverage when the remains are being searched for. Given the agony already endured by these families I have no doubt that, in the best traditions of the Irish media, they will be especially sensitive to this concern.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the current state of the peace process. We are discussing this legislation at what is, it must be conceded, a difficult time for the wider process. For several months there has been an impasse over the formation of the Executive, which has been related to decommissioning. Sadly, this has stalled the implementation of elements of the Good Friday Agreement. Having been present at recent talks in Belfast and London, I am utterly convinced that all parties remain committed to the success of the Agreement and are working in good faith to find a consensus on the best way forward. Huge efforts are being and will continue to be made to explore whatever limited room for manoeuvre may exist. The two Governments remain absolutely committed to seeing the Agreement implemented in full and will do everything possible to make it a reality.</P>
    <P>The parties met again earlier this week in round table format in Belfast and tomorrow will meet the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in London. I am sure the House will join me in wishing them every success in their endeavours. It is vitally important that dialogue continues. Without real engagement, an attempt to understand the other side's concerns and requirements, and a willingness to compromise, it will not be easy to reach that necessary consensus.</P>
    <P>In the disappointment of this present impasse, let us not lose sight of the great progress which has been recorded over the past year, which would have been inconceivable not long ago. This legislation is another step towards overcoming the terrible legacy of decades of conflict. While we have not yet succeeded in finding the consensus necessary to move forward, be assured that no one is walking and that we are still talking. There is no other way. The Agreement continues to represent the only viable way forward to the future of partnership and reconciliation which we all wish to see. It is the will of the people and it <Col N="278" /> is the responsibility of political leaders from all traditions to ensure their will is done.</P>
    <P>A number of important points were made which were more appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I will bring those matters to his attention. This evening's debate has been extremely useful, in the best traditions of this House. All views will be fully considered between now and Committee Stage, to which I look forward. I thank Deputies for their co-operation on this most important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter of immense local significance. The announcement of the closure of Radlink in Listowel comes as a major blow to the workforce, management and business community in north Kerry. Radlink, which was known as Stelrad until a management buy-out in 1995, employs 51 people. Stelrad was established in 1970 as a light engineering company manufacturing central heating radiator components, and at one stage it employed more than 80 people. It was taken over by Metal Box Limited, which in turn was acquired by Caradon in 1987.</P>
      <P>The various companies have served the people of north Kerry well over the years. They provided well paid jobs for many local people, with excellent working conditions. The workforce would readily acknowledge the quality of the jobs and the availability of overtime. Many family units were supported by the salaries generated in the plant over the years. The workers were able to take out mortgages, send their children to third level education and live comfortably. The finance generated by the plant was a major driving force in the local economy, boosting the income of local retail outlets, supermarkets, hotels and other businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 Caradon decided to cease activities in Listowel. This led to a management buy-out which included investment by SFADCo and Ash<Col N="279" /> hurst Limited. The new company was renamed Radlink and performed well until six months ago.</P>
    <P>Following the acquisition of Stelrad by Radlink, Caradon entered into an arrangement with the company and committed itself to taking products from Radlink for three years. This agreement ended recently. More than 60 per cent of goods produced at the plant were purchased by Caradon. As a result, Radlink became over-dependent on Caradon's custom and left itself somewhat exposed. Caradon has apparently decided to become self-sufficient and manufacture its own components. It also appears there is a 50 per cent excess capacity in the radiator manufacturing industry in Europe at present, which means there is not a demand for the product. The workforce at Radlink is highly skilled, with 15 employees working as fitters, electricians or toolmakers. The remainder of the workforce are skilful machine operators.</P>
    <P>The established industrial base in Listowel has been eroded considerably during the past two years. For example, Neodata closed in 1997 with the loss of 105 jobs and Munster Electronics closed in the same year with the loss of 70 jobs. Due to my efforts, assisted by the strong support of SFADCo, I succeeded in encouraging a small company, International Data Processing, to establish an operation in the Neodata plant which employs approximately 22 people. Following six months of intensive work, I succeeded in putting together a consortium to purchase and re-open the former Munster Electronics building and 25 people are now employed there.</P>
    <P>I accept that 45 people are employed at both plants but this falls far short of the 170 who were formerly employed by Neodata and Munster Electronics. The latest closure means that 220 jobs have now been lost. Job losses of this nature cannot be endured by a town such as Listowel, which has a population of fewer than 4,000 people. These job losses represent the equivalent of anything up to 50,000 job losses in Dublin. One can only imagine the outrage in Dáil Éireann if such an event occurred.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State that there are 1,280 people out of work in the greater Listowel area, which is probably one of the worst unemployment black spots in the country. The employment rate within a six mile radius of the town is approximately 400. As the local Oireachtas representative, I am depressed by these figures.</P>
    <P>I also remind the Minister of State that the recent decline in agricultural incomes in north Kerry has added further to the economic woes of the area. Farmers in north Kerry are leaving the land on a daily basis because they are frustrated by poor prices and disastrous weather conditions which have obtained in the past two years. To <Col N="280" /> sustain the economic base of our community we need to compensate for this flight from the land by providing industrial jobs. I call on the Minister of State to immediately put a task force in place comprising representatives of the IDA, Shannon Development, the Kerry County Enterprise Board, FÁS, the chairman of Listowel Urban District Council and local Oireachtas Members. A full-time officer, either an employee of Shannon Development or IDA Ireland, should be appointed to co-ordinate the work of the task force, to make contact with various companies at home and abroad and to work closely with officials of IDA Ireland in the USA and Europe to identify potential investors for Listowel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter. I and my Government colleagues were disappointed to hear that Radlink had decided to cease operations in Listowel on 7 May with the loss of 55 jobs. Such a loss is a serious blow for Listowel and for the north Kerry region. I sympathise with the employees who are now faced with redundancy.</P>
      <P>Radlink was established in Listowel in 1996 as a result of a management buy-out of a long established company involved in the manufacture of central heating radiator components. At that time, Shannon Development worked closely with the parent company to try to secure a rescue package. These efforts resulted in the successful management buy-out.</P>
      <P>At the time of the management buy-out the new owners of Radlink negotiated a three year contract with the former parent company Caradon. This contract. which has recently expired. represented the major part of the company's turnover. Unfortunately, the company did not succeed in sourcing any significant new business during the past three years. I am aware that the company experienced difficulties during 1998. It appears there were a number of factors which contributed to the closure of the company. These included its cost base being too high and an excess capacity in the market forcing prices downwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> During the past three months Shannon Development introduced a number of potential investors and strategic partners to Radlink. The board and management at Radlink also explored similar options in an effort to sustain the business and jobs at Listowel. Unfortunately, these efforts did not have any positive results. Shannon Development also encouraged the company to finalise agreements with its key customer in order to allow a realistic business plan to be prepared.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development has worked hard with the company over the past three years, to ensure its viability and ongoing sustainability. It is regrettable that circumstances have prevailed which have led to this state of affairs and that the board has decided that there is no option open to it other than to cease trading. I have instructed Shannon Development to continue to work actively to increase the level of industrial and services activity in the north Kerry region.</P>
    <P>With regard to Listowel, Shannon Development are assisting the Listowel Partnership Group in its efforts to provide a 15,000 sq. ft. modern advance factory for the town. Earlier this year, Shannon approved a BES certification for this project, which is scheduled for completion by April 2000. Having a new facility available in Listowel will provide an opportunity for the creation of between 50 and 100 new jobs in the town. In addition, Shannon Development's plans for Kerry Technology Park linked to the new Tralee information technology campus are now well advanced and the initial infrastructure and building work will start later this year.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, this loss is a severe blow to the development of Listowel. I consider that the appropriate response is to ensure that the industrial development agencies to which Deputy Deenihan referred, and Shannon Development in particular, focus their efforts on attracting replacement industry to the region. I am accordingly instructing Shannon Development to meet relevant local groups and agencies to ensure that these efforts are as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can rest assured the Tánaiste and I and our Department, on behalf of the Government and along with local Oireachtas representatives, will give every political support possible to ensuring that this vacuum is redressed as a matter of urgency and that employment is created for the people of Listowel as quickly as possible.</P>

        <b>:</b> The car park in Tullow is situated in the centre of the town and it was a tremendous asset to the town until it was occupied by travellers a number of years ago. The entire car park is now occupied by caravans and, as a result, people who should be shopping in Tullow are inclined to go elsewhere because they are unable to find parking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> The councillors representing the Tullow area have come under tremendous pressure to have the car park cleared and business people are rightly indignant that their livelihoods are being affected by the absence of car parking facilities. The council, under pressure, purchased land and a public inquiry was held on 21 October 1997. A further addition of land was required for road widening and an application for this was submitted on 15 July 1998. I tabled a question on 22 October 1998 asking the Minister when he would make a decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>The last line of his reply states: &ldquo;I will give my decision as soon as possible.&rdquo;  I tabled a question last week to which I got a written answer on Wednesday, 28 April. In an obvious effort to insult me, because there could be no other reason for it, the Minister gave me a one line reply which states: &ldquo;I will give my decision on the matter as soon as possible.&rdquo;  With due respect to the Minister of State, it does not help my humour that the Minister is not here to reply to this matter. It is outrageous that a person elevated to the rank of Minister would give the reply &ldquo;I will give my decision on the matter as soon as possible.&rdquo;  That is an insult. I got that reply last October. What are Ministers in office for if not to deal with problems that appear on their desks? I hope the Minister of State will be able to give me a decent answer. Ministers who give these type of one line replies and do not want to make decisions should be asked to resign and somebody else should be allowed do the work.</P>
    <P>That one line reply has not been the Minister's best line to date. He backed down on the issue of the dual mandate and he repealed regulations to allow an Independent stand for local elections. His time would be better spent making decisions on important issues such as this. The people of Tullow and members of Carlow County Council deserve better answers than one line replies stating: &ldquo;I will give my decision on the matter as soon as possible.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister of State has a decent answer for me and I look forward to hearing it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Carlow County Council submitted a compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of land for the purposes of providing a halting site at Ardristan. A public local inquiry was held on 21 and 29 October 1997 into objections received against confirmation of the order. In the course of the inquiry, reference was made to the possible compulsory acquisition of further lands in the same vicinity for road realignment <Col N="283" /> and legal issues to which this could give rise were mentioned in the course of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>On 15 July 1998 the council submitted the Carlow County Council Compulsory Purchase (Roads No. 2) Order, 1998, which provides for the acquisition of land for the realignment of the N81 at Ellengrove, Tullow. A report on this compulsory purchase order has been received from the inspector. It will be appreciated that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is acting in a quasi-judicial role in determining the foregoing orders and must give full and careful consideration to the case made by all parties before making a decision. Having regard to his quasi-judicial role and the need to give full and careful consideration to the issues involved, including issues arising from the making of orders for separate purposes in relation to adjacent lands, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment in the House on the merits or otherwise of the two orders currently before the Minister for consideration. I assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay on the Minister's part in finalising the matter and he will give his decision as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am grateful for the opportunity to address briefly a matter of importance, a request on behalf of the people of County Laois that the new offices of the national sports council be sited in the county. The House will be aware the Bill setting up the new council is at its concluding stages in the Seanad and I expect it will become law very shortly.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 Laois County Council, on foot of a motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy John Maloney, and seconded by me, requested that consideration be given by the Department of Tourism Sport and Recreation to the location of the Irish Sports Council headquarters at Portlaoise. There are a number of reasons for putting forward this proposal, not least that County Laois is the only county with a recreation, leisure and sports forum that is up and running. The forum has unanimously agreed and supported this proposal, which also has the support of Portlaoise Town Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important that full consideration for the siting of this centre be given to the town of Portlaoise, having regard to the role played by Laois County Council and the Laois <Col N="284" /> Recreation, Leisure and Sports Forum in developing a unique and far-seeing concept for leisure, recreation and sport in the midlands.</P>
    <P>I understand from the council that, in accordance with the legislation, the new building should be purpose built and redesigned to accommodate a state of the art training centre and a room for seminars and conferences, should have the potential for sport psychology labs, be able to accommodate the staff, have an information centre, library service, Government publication service, adequate car parking, a green area with potential for landscape, a restaurant area and a changing area. In the context of the ever-increasing gridlock in Dublin and the east coast, I make this application to the House and to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some issues of serious concern on the east coast do not arise in Portlaoise. I refer to the absence of parking restrictions and traffic congestion in Portlaoise, it is very accessible, there is no curtailment on future expansion and there are many green areas. It appears contrary to Government policy to introduce a further concentration of activities in city centre areas, thereby giving rise to greater traffic congestion, while adequate facilities are available within an hour's drive or a 50 minute rail journey from the city.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the role of modern technology, Portlaoise is most suitable for a development of this significance. Our advantage as a midland county is that Laois is unique in that it is the only county in the country that has established a recreation, leisure and sports forum. It is ideally located in terms of centrality and accessibility. Portlaoise is the second fastest growing urban area in the State in terms of towns with a population of between 5,000 and 30,000. The dynamic growth of the town is reflected in the age structure of the population, the range of educational and training institutions and the proportion of new housing stock with modern services. More than 2,000 private houses are under construction at present in Portlaoise. Portlaoise has the best possible telecommunications infrastructure in the State and it has considerable unrealised development potential in areas of distribution, office relocations from Dublin, hotel development, conference centres, cultural development and urban renewal.</P>
    <P>It is in keeping with the spirit and letter of the legislation that consideration should be given to siting this centre in an area outside the Dublin metropolitan area. Laois County Council, through its foresight and vision, supported the establishment of the recreation, leisure and sports forum in terms of time, personnel and finance. Laois is the first county that carried out a detailed needs analysis of sporting requirements in the county. That was done by dint of our sports and leisure officer, who works solely in the area of sports development. The county has shown a lead <Col N="285" /> by being one of the first to establish a full-time sports and leisure officer.</P>
    <P>This submission has been forwarded to the Minister, Deputy McDaid. It is a partnership submission in the name of Laois County Council, Portlaoise Town Commission and the Laois Recreation, Leisure and Sports Forum and it has the support of every public representative in the county. I hope it will be given careful and favourable consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter. Government involvement in the development of sports dates from 1969 when the sports section was established in the Department of Education. The first Sports Council was established in 1971. Since that time, a Sports Council has existed in various forms on a non-statutory basis and with some lapsed periods. Essentially, the purpose of the council was to act as an advisory body to the Minister and the Government on matters relating to sport.</P>
      <P>Between 1971 and 1997 responsibility for sport resided with the Minister of State at the Department of Education. The establishment of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in July 1997 has meant that for the first time a Minister for sport sits at the Cabinet table. This is an indication of the Government's commitment to and belief in the value and importance of sport in Irish life as we enter the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Part of that commitment and belief can be seen in the presentation of the Irish Sports Council Bill to the Dáil. The Bill, which passed Second Stage in the Seanad today, will place the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis. The role of the council will be broadened beyond that of an advisory body to include executive functions, some of which are at present the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
      <P>The current sports council, chaired by John Treacy, was established in June 1996 to advise the Minister with responsibility for sport on all aspects of sport and to co-ordinate the resources and energies of the sports movement. Over the past year the council has been working with the national governing bodies of sport &ndash; NGBs &ndash; to help strengthen their capacity to deliver effectively across the whole spectrum of sporting activities.</P>
      <P>Of the 75 NGBs currently in existence, 61 are based in Dublin. The council regularly meets representatives of the NGBs, most of whom act in a voluntary capacity for the sport they represent. It is considered appropriate that the Irish Sports Council should be located close to where the majority of the NGBs are located for administrative purposes. Locating the council outside the Dublin area would also place unnecessary travel and other costs on NGBs and their representatives. This fact alone creates a strong case for siting the council in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> In addition, it is important that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation works closely with the Irish Sports Council. It is essential that the Irish Sports Council be located close to the Department and, as stated earlier, to the national governing bodies and other organisations with which the council has contact.</P>
    <P>For this reason, and not to impose unnecessary financial burdens on the voluntary members of the NGBs, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, considers it appropriate and essential that the new Irish Sports Council be located in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The council is located at 21 Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin 2. Those premises are being refurbished at present in preparation for the increased staffing which will follow its statutory establishment. The council is established in its premises and any move at this stage would have logistical and unnecessary cost implications.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, does not see a case for siting the new, statutory Irish Sports Council outside Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the case of John, not his real name. John is a severely handicapped person who requires a personal assistant but cannot get one due to a long waiting list. Rather than retell John's case, I would like to read to the House this letter which I received from John indicating the conditions he is at present living in:</P>
      <P>I live on my own and I am legally registered as a blind person. I am also physically disabled and have several chronic illnesses. I am on the long-term catheter-urinal bag for the rest of my life due to one of my chronic illnesses. I suffer from severe gout to all the joints in my body. I also suffer from severe arthritis in my legs due to several breakages. This also affects my back and neck area. I also suffer from a bowel disease called diverticulitis. I also have an irritable bowel syndrome. I also suffer from an acute chronic disease called porphyria, which affects my whole body and makes me ill at times. I also suffer from depression and I am on medication every day for this. I also have a hearing disorder, due to my time served in the Irish Army, for which I have not claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am alone for approximately 21 hours a day and this makes me feel very isolated. The only help I am getting at present is a home help for one hour three times daily. They cook and clean for me and the rest of the time I spend alone. Fingal County Council gave me this bungalow last September equipped with disabled friendly facilities and I am grateful to the council for this. It is a pity the health board <Col N="287" /> could not do the same for me with regard to the personal assistants.</P>
    <P>This man wants to live independently rather than in an institution. This will be his fate &ndash; at great cost to the State, more than the cost of personal assistance &ndash; if his plea is not answered.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable that this situation in which this person finds himself is allowed to continue today, when our economy is booming and tax revenue is up by £200 million in the first quarter of this year. How can I explain to this man that there is not enough money to pay for his assistants?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to heed the pleas of this severely handicapped person and to assure me that two personal assistants will be appointed without any further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position on the provision of personal assistance services to people with physical disabilities. The relationship between the person with a disability and the personal assistant is an employee/employer type arrangement. It will be readily appreciated that not every person with a disability who might benefit from this service has the personal qualities necessary to successfully manage a personal assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the health boards. I have had inquiries made of the relevant health board and have been informed that the individual in question is already receiving a home help service on a daily basis and has recently been assessed for a home care attendant service which will be provided for a short period per week initially. I understand that, in addition, he is on a waiting list for assessment to establish <Col N="288" /> whether he would be suitable for a personal assistant.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Government's policy on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable them to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. These services are being developed in line with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996. This involves provision of a range of services such as respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports, including the personal assistance service. I am aware that all these services, including the personal assistance service, are in need of further development. The report of the review group sets out in detail the requirements for the maintenance and development of the services.</P>
    <P>In developing the services, it is not feasible to isolate any particular service, such as the personal assistance service. The objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole, in accordance with the availability of funding.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office, a total of almost £37 million has been invested in the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year a total of £13.4 million is being provided, of which £3 million is for development. This sum of £3 million translates into a full year cost of £6 million in the year 2000. It is a matter for each health board to decide, in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services, on priorities for the allocation of this funding in its functional area. The development of personal assistance services is one of the priority areas to be considered in this process.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 May 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Tobin and Mrs. Tobin, visited Ireland the week before last. The main purpose of the Premier's visit was to lead a business mission to Ireland. He was accompanied by his Ministers for Industry, Trade and Technology and Justice and Finance.</P>
      <P>The business mission took place pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding concluded between the Government of Ireland and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1996. This MoU was concluded during the period of office of the administration headed by Deputy Bruton, in recognition of the fact that this province of Canada has the highest proportion of people of Irish descent of any area of settlement world-wide, and because of the commonalties and the potential for mutual benefit for the two participants.</P>
      <P>The mission was organised by Ireland Business Partnerships which were set up in Newfoundland by Premier Tobin to implement the Memorandum of Understanding. It was done in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs &ndash; with considerable input from Enterprise Ireland. The mission, which also involved the St. John's Board of Trade, included a wide range of companies with a particular focus on information technology, environmental technologies, tourism and film-making. Pre-matching of companies had taken place so that each company had a tailored itinerary of focused meetings in pre-identified areas, in numerous locations around the country, including Galway, Waterford, Cork and of course Dublin.</P>
      <P>I hosted breakfast for the Premier and senior members of his delegation on Monday 19 April. I reiterated to them the commitment I gave when I took office in 1997 to continue to progress the objectives of the MoU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday, 21 April I hosted a State Reception at Dublin Castle for the Premier, the visiting business delegation and those on the Irish side with whom they are now discussing or doing business. Prior to the reception, the Premier and I signed a re-affirmation of the Memorandum of Understanding. A number of business deals and agreements between Irish companies and organisations and companies from Newfoundland and Labrador were also signed at that time. I am also informed that following on from the week-long intensive series of meetings between Newfoundland and Irish companies, a number of further sig<Col N="290" /> nificant agreements are likely to result &ndash; to the benefit of both sides.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Premier, I undertook to support a strong reciprocal business mission to Newfoundland &ndash; probably later this year. It is envisaged that this mission will be led by the Minister of State with responsibility for International Trade, Tom Kitt, TD.</P>
    <P>The feedback from the businesses participating in the delegation was very positive. Premier Tobin himself was delighted with the outcome of the mission which he described as the most successful business mission by a Newfoundland and Labrador delegation to any destination ever.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 24, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My address to the IMI national conference was focused mainly on the need to upgrade our infrastructure, especially through the next National Development Plan; the importance of Research and Development investment in the information <Col N="291" /> age; and the need to continue development of the social partnership model &ndash; at both the national and workplace levels &ndash; to meet the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>At the most recent plenary meeting of Partnership 2000, these and other topics were explored under the broad themes of Enterprise, Jobs and Small Business and Modernising the Public Service. Among the key issues raised by the social partners were: (i) the need to address skills shortages and planning bottlenecks in order to facilitate the delivery of major projects; (ii) the desirability of further consultations before finalisation of the National Development Plan; (iii) the need for a more co-ordinated and fully integrated approach to promoting life-long learning; and (iv) the need to press ahead with regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>On planning bottlenecks, the meeting noted the priority being given to the preparation of a Consolidated Planning Bill and the assignment of additional staff to An Bórd Pleanála. On skills shortages, the recent announcement of 5,400 extra high technology places and the launch of the FIT initiative were welcomed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the National Development Plan, the meeting was advised of my intention, as I stated in my IMI address, to consult with the social partners over the coming weeks so that finalisation of the plan will reflect a broad agreement about the development needs of the economy and, in so doing, provide a further boost to the social partnership process. To that end, meetings with each of the four pillars, involving the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and myself, are being arranged at present.</P>
    <P>On regulatory reform, the meeting was informed that, as I indicated to the House last week, I expect to be in a position to put detailed proposals to my colleagues in Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Bruton's question on the Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment, the Departments concerned have been meeting with the social partners. Arising from this, a standing committee, under the chairmanship of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been formed. Its main purpose is to consider, in consultation with the social partners, the extent to which active labour market measures under the present agreement have had a special focus on the long-term unemployed, particularly those who are 35 years of age, or over.</P>
    <P>The most recent meeting of the standing committee took place on 27 April and a further two meetings are planned for 17 May and 9 June. The next meeting of the Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment will take place later this month.</P>

    <P>I gave my commitment to form an interdepartmental group to work with them, in an exercise broadly similar to that carried out in relation to the Irish Government's assessment of the evidence relating to Bloody Sunday.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the law on barring orders was the subject of a comprehensive review which led to enactment of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy, in his question to me, is referring to the position of cohabitants as they are defined in the Act of 1996. The requirement is that cohabitants must be living together for a certain period of time prior to an application for a barring order or a safety order for their protection under the Act. The Deputy seems to suggest that the law be now changed to permit cohabitants who no longer live together to avail of the provisions in the Act. My understanding is that when the legislation was being framed it took into account detailed consultations on the legal and constitutional issues involved and that the legislation went as far as it could go in relation to the position of cohabitants.</P>
      <P>I can say, however, that the operation of the law in relation to domestic violence continues to be reviewed by my Department in consultation with, among others, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women. The committee has identified the area represented by the Deputy as one that should be examined and Women's Aid, in a special research project, have done likewise. I have arranged for further examination of this area of the law and I can also inform the House that where changes are found to be feasible I shall include them in the context of the proposed Family Law Bill that is referred to in the Government's legislation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I appointed an expert group under the distinguished chairmanship of Mr. Eamon Leahy, SC, to consider changes in the criminal law recommended in the report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, with particular reference to the Constitutional and European Convention on Human Rights implications and having regard to the critical balance referred to in the report between the rights of the individual and that of the common good.</P>
      <P>The group's report was submitted to me last July, noted by the Government last November and subsequently made publicly available. The report is being examined in my Department at present with a view to submitting proposals to Government.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that any proposals which are brought forward will take fully into account the question of appropriate safeguards. Indeed at the conclusion of the report the group indicated that they were conscious of the need to balance additional powers with appropriate safeguards and their recommendations, individually and in their totality, were designed to respect this. Nevertheless they recommended consideration be given to further safeguards including the video recording of interviews in Garda custody. In this context I can inform the House that on 27 April last I received an interim report from the Steering Committee on Audio and Audio-Video Recording of Garda Questioning of Detained Persons in which substantive recommendations are made in relation to a national scheme of electronic recording.</P>
      <P>In addition, while the operation of the Garda Complaints Procedure was outside the remit of the Leahy group, I have already informed the House that I have under consideration the recently published third report of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board which makes a number of recommendations for legislative and procedural change to enhance the board's effectiveness.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances I envisage that the proposals contained in the Leahy report, the steering group report and the complaints board report will be examined in parallel particularly in the context of ensuring that any proposed changes in the criminal law will be accompanied by appropriate safeguards. Obviously in advance of finalisation of that process I cannot give the House details of the precise approach which the Government will take to these matters.</P>

      <P>Methadone maintenance is an important element in the package of treatment options made available by the Eastern Health Board to drug addict patients. In so far as the prison system is concerned, my Department has an agreed medical policy with the EHB which seeks to provide the same access to treatment for drug addicted prisoners as patients have in the community. I have recently approved a draft action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which builds on the medical policy agreed with the EHB. The action plan includes increased provision of methadone maintenance primarily to prisoners who on committal are already on a medically supervised methadone maintenance programme.</P>
      <P>At present, a small number of prisoners may avail of methadone maintenance while serving their sentences. These prisoners are availing of treatment for HIV infection in the medical unit in Mountjoy and methadone maintenance forms an important part of this treatment. Otherwise all prisoners who show evidence of recent opiate abuse on committal to Mountjoy Prison or St Patrick's Institution are offered a medically supervised detoxification course which involves decreasing doses of methadone over a 14 day period. This regime may be altered where there are clinical indications that this is needed, e.g. HIV positive prisoners and pregnant female prisoners.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am determined to ensure that every individual in this country is treated equally before the law regardless of his or her ethnic origin.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are committed to ensuring that members of the Garda Síochána receive training in race relations in view of the changing nature of Irish society and that the content of this training is kept under ongoing review.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all student and probationer gardaí receive instruction in the area of race relations as part of their two year education and training programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, the social studies element of the programme deals with discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping and best practice for policing interaction with ethnic minority groups. It includes a seminar on ethnicity, traveller culture and discrimination against the travelling community. <Col N="297" /> Pavee Point make a presentation at this seminar. The social studies course also covers instruction in human rights conferred by the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights and deals with policing and human rights.</P>
    <P>The legal studies element of the training and education programme provides instruction in the relevant provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>As recently as last week, the Garda authorities hosted an international conference, co-funded by the EU Commission and the Government, entitled &ldquo;providing a police service in a developing multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Ireland&rdquo;. They are to be congratulated on this early initiative and their foresight and openness in addressing this question. The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society. In particular, the training currently provided to student and probationer gardaí is to be reviewed and enhanced in the light of the outcomes of this conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously told the House, the trace group consists of an assistant commissioner, one superintendent, one inspector, two detective sergeants and two detective gardaí, and is based at Naas Garda station. The group has been set up to specifically re-examine a number of the original investigations of missing persons cases. They have begun this task by initially reviewing the cases of six high profile missing persons cases. I am informed by the Garda authorities that other cases which may be relevant, are also being reviewed.</P>
      <P>Operation Trace, since its inception, has attracted widespread media interest, this, coupled with the TV series &ldquo;Solved and Unsolved&rdquo; has encouraged the public to report incidents not previously reported. I think we would all agree that media interest and coverage of the operation has in general been positive.</P>
      <P>Operation Trace is currently collating information received from both within the force and the public on crimes and incidents involving a sexual element. This information is being analysed and added to the database of known sexual offenders maintained in the trace incident room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the examination of the original investigation files is ongoing and that new information is currently being processed and pursued. As the House is aware, searches have been carried out in a number of areas. I am further <Col N="298" /> informed that a number of interviews have been conducted to date with persons who have been linked to the investigation.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate in investigations such as this progress is slow and time consuming, however it is felt that the operation will yield benefits. I am informed that the terms of reference of the investigation have not been expanded since its inception.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of public concern on the issue, which indeed I share. I believe the Garda Commissioner is doing all he can to ensure that effective arrangements are in place and the necessary resources are made available to trace those who are reported missing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 83 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the Legal Aid Board, I am aware of the demands on its services. In consultation with the board, I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the legal aid board. I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources. Where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action. The waiting times for appointments with solicitors as at 31 March 1999 are set out in the table which I will have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The legal aid board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board intends to extend the scheme on a nation-wide basis in the coming months. This should increase the throughput of legally aided cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. <Col N="299" /> A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis.  None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the increase in waiting times I made additional resources available to the legal aid board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million and, in 1999, I am further increasing the allocation by 24 per cent to £11.953 million. In addition, I have allocated a further £1 million in 1999 for legal services for asylum seekers, bringing the total current allocation to £12.953 million, an increase of 35 per cent approximately over last year.</P>
    <P>Last July I approved 25 additional posts for the legal aid board. Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, were for law centres.</P>
    <P>These posts were allocated as follows: Wicklow &ndash; 1 solicitor, 1 clerical officer; Popes Quay &ndash; 1 solicitor, 2 clerical officers; Cork Sth &ndash; 1 Solicitor, 2 clerical officers, 1 law clerk; Galway &ndash; 1 solicitor, 1 clerical officer; Sligo &ndash; 1 solicitor,  1 clerical officer; Clondalkin &ndash; 1 clerical officer; Mount St &ndash; 1 clerical officer; Finglas &ndash; 1 clerical officer; Tallaght &ndash; 1 clerical officer.</P>
    <P>The remaining posts which I approved for the board were comprised of six transient posts which I had made into permanent posts. These were allocated as follows: Gardiner St &ndash; 1 solicitor, 1 clerical officer; Newbridge &ndash;   1 solicitor, 1 clerical officer; Tullamore &ndash; 1 solicitor, 1 clerical officer.</P>
    <P>I believe that these allocations of staff and finance, and the other initiatives in which the board is engaged, should help to alleviate the situation with regard to waiting times in the law centres.</P>
    <P>I have no proposal before me for the establishment of law centres for the regions. The emphasis by the legal aid board is on providing an enhanced quality service to its customers from its network of existing law centres and in this it has my full support.</P>
    <P>Waiting Time (in months) for appointments with solicitors of the Legal Aid Board at 31 March, 1999.</P>

    <P>Because of the very wide spectrum of cases and the considerable backlog of applications which I inherited on taking office as Minister, it is difficult to identify an average time from start to finish of the asylum determination process which would have any real meaning.</P>
    <P>The task force which I put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with new and old applications simultaneously. At the present rate of progress and based on current application figures, I am advised that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date will be processing applications within weeks of arrival.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Working Group on Qualifications for Appointment as Judges of the High and Supreme Courts was published on 16 February 1999. I indicated at the time of publication that any legislative provisions required would be contained in a proposed Courts Bill which would be brought to Government for approval in due course. The Bill now forms part of the Government's legislation programme as announced by the Chief Whip on 15 April 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report recommends extending eligibility for appointment as a judge of the High or Supreme Courts to a certain category of solicitor but it does not recommend extending such eligibility to legal academics.</P>
      <P>In developing proposals for the scheme of a courts Bill, careful consideration is being given to each of the working group's recommendations and their implications. I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, judicial appointments are made by the President acting on the advice of the Government.

      <P>A total of 20 multi-agency checkpoints, 12 in 1998 and eight to date in 1999, involving the gardaí, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have been mounted in 1998 and 1999 to date in counties Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Monaghan, Cavan, Louth and Meath.</P>
      <P>The gardaí have given the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the other agencies mentioned above the opportunity to be involved in the operation of multi-agency checkpoints. The purpose of the checkpoints is to monitor compliance with various enactments. Each agency exercises the option to participate, as its own operational needs require, and operates in accordance with the law relating to its own area of responsibility. I wish to emphasise, so as to avoid any confusion in this regard, that it is not the function of the Garda Síochána to carry out spot checks on social welfare recipients. The role of the gardaí in multi-agency checkpoints is to monitor compliance with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, as amended by section 28 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides that the following persons shall be qualified for appointment to the office of the Chief Justice: the President of the High Court; an ordinary Judge of the Supreme Court; an ordinary Judge of the High Court; a person who is for the time being a practising barrister of not less than twelve years standing, for this purpose service as a Judge of the Circuit Court, the Court of Justice, the <Col N="304" /> Court of First Instance attached thereto or as an Advocate-General of the Court of Justice shall be deemed practice at the Bar.</P>
    <P>Under section 23 of the 1995 Act, where the Government proposes to advise the President on an appointment to the office of Chief Justice, it must have regard first to the qualifications and suitability of persons who are serving at that time as judges in Courts established in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Under the established procedures covering Article 169 proceedings, Ireland has two months from the date of the communication from the European Commission within which to respond to the issue raised in it. In accordance with these procedures, a response was forwarded yesterday, 4 May, to the European Commission, via the Permanent Representation. The response sets out the reasons for the approach adopted by Ireland in the context of the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>

      <P>The refugee legal service commenced operations on 22 February 1999 from the Refugee Applications Centre in Lower Mount Street. It is an independent, comprehensive legal service to assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure including representation at appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the service being provided by solicitors employed by the legal aid board, the <Col N="305" /> board will be engaging private solicitors who will be paid on a fee per case basis, in accordance with the board's private practitioners' scheme for legal services as provided for certain District Court family law cases. The legal aid board is awaiting clearance of draft terms and conditions from the Department of Finance in order to proceed with the establishment of a panel of private practitioners who will provide such a service in compliance with the board's terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive training commenced on 13 January 1999 and is provided on an ongoing basis. This training is provided in conjunction with the UNHCR. Interpretation and translation services will be provided as required by private agencies.</P>
    <P>The legal aid board will also be taking over responsibility from the UNHCR for the management of the research and documentation centre.</P>
    <P>I am in the process of establishing an independent monitoring committee for the refugee legal service. The role of the monitoring committee is to ensure that a quality refugee legal service is provided in accordance with the arrangement agreed between the legal aid board and the Department and to investigate complaints from customers of the service. Persons with suitable experience and expertise have been invited to serve on the committee. I am awaiting confirmation from one member, all others have confirmed they will be in a position to serve on the committee.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to appoint an officer from my Department to act as secretary to the committee. In relation to its overseeing role, it is envisaged that the committee will meet approximately four times a year. Depending on the incidence of complaints received more frequent meetings may be required.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for investigating complaints about the quality of the refugee service will be vested in the secretary to the committee. The outcome of these investigations will be considered by the committee at its regular meetings and the result communicated to the legal aid board and the Department where necessary.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The prisoner concerned was escorted to the High Court for a bail application on 12 April 1999. He was placed in a holding room for prisoners which is between High Court No. 1 and High Court No. 2 in the main Four Courts building. This room is not a purpose built holding cell. The wire grill on the exterior of the window in the holding room had been tampered with and this facilitated the prisoner in making good his escape. The wire grill had been tampered with from the outside prior to this date by a person or persons unknown. The prisoner was apprehended by gardaí on 14 April 1999 and was returned to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the circumstances surrounding the escape are the subject of a criminal investigation and a file is being prepared for the DPP. Accordingly, it is not possible to comment further on the details of the escape.</P>
      <P>In the light of the escape a number of initiatives are being taken to improve the security arrangements in the Four Courts. On the day the incident took place I asked the Garda authorities, in conjunction with the Courts authorities to undertake an immediate review of prisoner security at the Four Courts complex. Officials of my Department, the Office of Public Works and Courts management met with members of the Garda Crime Prevention Unit and I understand that the Garda authorities will be recommending a number of measures to be implemented immediately to improve security at the Four Courts. In addition, a more detailed study of the security arrangements is being undertaken and any recommendations made in this security review will be implemented in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September, 1997 purpose built holding cells were provided in the Chancery Place block of the Four Courts with access to and from the holding cells and to the Courts in the building without coming into contact with the public. It is also planned to provide additional purpose built holding cells in the basement of the Old Public Records building later this year. My Department <Col N="308" /> is in consultation with the Office of Public Works regarding the possibility of providing additional purpose built holding cell accommodation in the main Four Courts building.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the new remand prison and courthouse in Cloverhill will be coming on stream later this year and this will alleviate the pressure on holding cell accommodation in the Four Courts as it is intended that High Court bail applications will be heard in the courthouse beside Cloverhill Prison. The new Cloverhill courthouse has proper holding cell accommodation.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report to the House on the progress of Garda investigations and accordingly, I do not propose to depart from that practice now other than to say that I understand that the Garda investigation in this matter is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>Yes, I have examined the newspaper article in question concerning a study, carried out by the Holy Spirit Congregation in association with UCD's public health department. The authors of the study have acknowledged that there are limitations relating to the relatively small sample size and the non-random manner in which it was achieved. In addition, they have stated that although it was acceptable for a pilot-phase study, findings cannot be generalised with any degree of statistical confidence to the general population of asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers are people seeking refugee status on the basis that they are escaping from <Col N="309" /> persecution. Procedures are in place for assessing asylum applications which are examined in accordance with the criteria as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996. Asylum seekers' third level qualifications are not taken into account in the assessment of their application for refugee status. Asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications. The Refugee Act, actually provides that asylum applicants shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their applications.</P>
    <P>The skills shortages identified in our labour market at present is a separate issue. When applicants are granted refugee status, they are entitled to seek employment in the same manner as an Irish national. However, as the Deputy is aware, the issue of allowing asylum seekers the right to work is currently under consideration by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, crime statistics in respect of the past 12 months have not yet been published. Provisional statistics for the 12 months ending 31 March 1999 are, however, available to me. I should emphasise that these figures may be subject to change as Garda investigations progress. As the House is aware there has been a continued drop in crime levels with the number of crimes reported in the first quarter of this year being 9 per cent lower than the same period in 1998. Crime is now 15 per cent lower than it was two years ago. This is, in my opinion, proof that the Government's policies on crime are working.</P>
      <P>I understand that by serious crime, the Deputy is referring in particular to the offences of rape, murder, armed robbery and aggravated burglary with firearms and I shall, accordingly, limit my specific comments to these crimes.</P>
      <P>In the case of murder, the statistics show no change over the period, with 39 offences recorded in both 12 month periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, the number of rapes reported to the gardai rose from 299 to 325. The rate of increase has slowed down dramatically, however, from 30 per cent at the end of March, 1998 to 9 per cent at the end of March this year. I welcome the Garda Commissioner's recent announcement that he is taking all the necessary steps to identify the reasons for this increase and to put in place <Col N="310" /> measures to tackle this vicious crime. The House may be interested to know that I expect to publish legislation during the summer which will give added protection to victims of rape during criminal trials when their attacker is brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Finally, statistics for the 12 months ending on 31 March 1999 indicate that robbery with firearms and aggravated burglary with firearms declined by ten per cent, from 250 to 226 offences, during that period.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person arrested in connection with a murder (details supplied), and subsequently released due to legal inadequacies in the extradition warrant from the RUC, has not been re-arrested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point to be made is that there was no inadequacy in the extradition warrant in this case.</P>
      <P>In February 1993 warrants were received from the RUC seeking the extradition of three persons in connection with the murder of a person in Northern Ireland. The extradition of all three persons was subsequently ordered by the District Court and all three appealed these orders. Following High Court and Supreme Court appeals, two of the persons were extradited. In respect of the third person, who is the subject of this question, the High Court discharged the order of the District Court and directed his release. The State's appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's reasons for the decision reached are set out in its judgment &ndash; see Larkin v. O'Dea [1 995] 2 I.R.500.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the Supreme Court decision, the Attorney General's office in London contacted the Irish Attorney General's office and both Offices were of the view that a further application for the extradition of the person concerned in connection with this murder charge would not succeed.</P>
      <P>Under Irish law a prosecution in this jurisdiction for murder committed in Northern Ireland is possible. The taking of prosecutions is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions but, of course, the Director can only act on the basis of a sufficiency of evidence. It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to comment in relation to the possibility of a prosecution in this case other than to draw attention to the fact that the Supreme Court has held that the evidence gathered during the applicant's detention would be inadmissible at any trial of the applicant within the State.</P>

      <P>Statistics are maintained in a manual format and consequently, the time required to collate the information sought by the Deputy cannot be justified. However, this type of information should be readily available once the new prisoners record database which is part of a £6 million IT system currently being devised is introduced and becomes fully operational in the prison system.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy, however, that there were a total of 424 prisoners on temporary release on Thursday, 29 April 1999 representing 13 per cent of the total number of offenders serving sentence. The daily numbers of temporary release has in fact decreased considerably since I came to office. There were, for example, 552 prisoners on temporary release on Thursday, 1 May 1997 representing 18 per cent of the total number of prisoners serving sentences on that day. I should point out that the vast majority of these prisoners were granted renewable temporary release and are required to report back to the prison on a weekly basis. It is also a condition of renewable temporary release that offenders report to their local Garda station on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours, for example, to attend a funeral; early temporary release which must be renewed weekly or on full temporary release in the last weeks of their sentences.</P>
      <P>In addition, the granting of temporary release may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation; in other words, prisoners may be released earlier than planned due to overcrowding. This has been the case for several years.</P>
      <P>The overriding concern, however, when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public. Careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that persons serving sentences for serious crimes such as importation and supply of drugs, sex offences, armed robbery and other cases involving serious violence are not granted periods of temporary release except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of some 1,000 additional prison places later this year at the new women's prison at Mountjoy, the new remand prison in Cloverhill <Col N="312" /> and the new Midlands Prison in Portlaoise will help to eliminate the problem of overcrowding and thereby tackle the need to grant temporary or early release for that reason alone in a meaningful way.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that 1 am aware of the situation to which the Deputy refers. I am also aware that the Deputy published a Censorship of Publications (Amendment) Bill last year in this regard.</P>
      <P>The principal legislation in relation to the censorship of publications is contained in the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, and the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946. Under this legislation the Censorship of Publications Board may prohibit or decide not to prohibit publications in respect of which it receives complaints from the public.</P>
      <P>The Censorship of Publications Act, 1967 provided for the expiration of prohibition orders, made on the grounds that a book was indecent or obscene, after a period of twelve years. At that time contraception and abortion were still illegal and the Act was, therefore, silent in relation to publications banned on grounds of containing references to contraception and-or abortion.</P>
      <P>Subsequently the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 amended the legislation in regard to publications advocating the unnatural prevention of conception and the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995 amended the legislation in regard to publications containing lawfully available information relating to the termination of pregnancy outside the state.</P>
      <P>While these Acts provided for the situation of publications created on or after the enactment of the respective legislation, neither Act addressed the provision in the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967 in relation to the expiration of prohibition orders already in place in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision at present, under section 8 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, where any prohibition in respect of a book may be appealed by the author, the editor, the publisher or any five members of the Oireachtas acting jointly. Such persons can apply to the Appeal Board, who may as they think proper, affirm or revoke the prohibition order. The board may also vary the order so as to exclude from the appli<Col N="313" /> cation any particular edition of the prohibited book.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the buoyancy of the property market in recent years has resulted in an unprecedented increase in intake of all categories of work in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>To quote a few examples, in 1989 the intake of dealings was 91,381 &ndash; in 1994 this figure had increased to 103,145, an increase of 12.9 per cent, and at the end of 1998 the figure was 123,082, an increase of 34.7 per cent over the 1989 figure. The latter figure represents the largest ever intake of dealings into the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that during the same period output increased from 72,668 in 1989, to 113,108 in 1998, an increase of 55.6 per cent. This is a significant achievement and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Registrar of Deeds and Titles and her staff for their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the light of the circumstances, my Department has made a case to the Department of Finance for the allocation of additional staff to the Land Registry to deal with this increase in the level of business and discussions in this regard, in the context of current Government policy on Civil Service staffing numbers, are being held between the two Departments at a high level.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is aware that my Department's report on the early release from prison of Philip Sheedy recommended that all future appointments to the position of county registrar should be made through open public competition under the supervision of the Civil Service Commission.

      <P>In the current year, my Department will be funding 24 Garda youth diversion projects. This represents a doubling of the number of these projects from 12 to 24 during my term of office.</P>
      <P>Of the 14 projects established between 1991 and 1998, seven projects operate in Dublin. These are located in Ronanstown, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Cherry Orchard, Darndale, the North Inner City, and Finglas South. In addition to these, six new projects are being established this year. These will be located at Donore Avenue, Hardwicke Street, O'Devaney Gardens, Ballybrack-Loughlinstown, Lower Ballyfermot and Ballymun.</P>
      <P>Three projects have been established in Cork city. These are in Knocknaheeney, Mahon, and the Glen. The two Limerick city projects are based in Moyross and Southill. Two projects also operate in Waterford, one in the Ballybeg area in the west of the city, and the other in the Farran Park area in the south-east of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> The remaining projects are located in Bray, Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The projects do not all conform to the same structure, as they are &ldquo;tailor-made&rdquo; to address the specific needs and problems in their area. For this reason, the numbers of young people involved in each project will vary from place to place, and from time to time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the outcome of the schemes, the current network of projects are the subject of an evaluation being carried out by the Children's Research Centre, Trinity College.</P>

      <P>The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application.</P>
      <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court Judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other Courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995 enable me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I made £60,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the Institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sixth Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission also made reference to the issue of sentencing. The working group suggest that judicial education could be addressed by a judicial standards body in liaison with the Judicial Studies Institute. This new body could, <i>inter alia</i>, provide a monitoring and analytical service on <Col N="317" /> matters such as sentencing along the lines of the Judicial Commission in New South Wales.</P>
    <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by 11 the Law Reform Commission who specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Their report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>

The Government will be represented at the ceremony by Ms Mary Wallace TD, Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Equality and Disability. The award, which includes a bust of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and prize money of $50,000, is presented annually to a nation that makes noteworthy national progress towards the goal of full participation of citizens with disabilities as encouraged by the United Nations World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons which was adopted unanimously in the UN General Assembly in 1982.</P>
      <P>Ireland was selected for the award because of its progress in raising consciousness about the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities and enhancing their full acceptance in society. I readily acknowledge the role of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities in nominating Ireland for the award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prize money is to be presented by the President for an outstanding non-governmental disability programme in Ireland.

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Nos. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwellinghouses. Part III of the (No. 2) Act, provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 13 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is no obstacle to the tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
      <P>A Bill entitled the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill passed Second Stage in the House on 19 March 1997. The detail of this Bill is being examined in my Department at present, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Registrar of Titles, particularly from the point of view of the constitutionality and practicality of its proposals in relation to land law generally and in particular the land registration system. The difficulty, which successive Governments have accepted over the years, is that abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation would not be in keeping with constitutional requirements. The details of any decisions which can overcome such difficulties will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that the 1997 programme for Government listed as one of its key priorities, in the measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a drug courts system which would involve count supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences. In accordance with this commitment, I requested the Working Group on a Courts Commission, chaired by the Honourable Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, to consider the establishment of a drug courts system in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 September 1998, I announced that the Government had approved the publication of the fifth report of the working group on a courts commission &ndash; Drug Courts &ndash; which sets out details and experiences of drug courts in the USA and other European jurisdictions. I also announced that I had secured Government approval for the establishment of a drug courts planning commit<Col N="320" /> tee to prepare plans for the establishment of a drug courts pilot project in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The development of a drug courts system on a pilot basis marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure for dealing with the less serious and non-violent drug offenders. It is the beginning of a fundamental realignment of the response of the criminal justice system to those involved in less serious drug related offences. In effect, drug courts afford persons in trouble with the law on foot of having committed minor to non-violent drug-related offences an opportunity to be treated under courts supervision as an alternative to the more usual penal sanctions which can be proposed. I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course and if the US experience &ndash; which shows that criminal activity for drug related crimes decreases or is eliminated as a result of treatment &ndash; is repeated here, I believe that this initiative is likely to have a profound effect over time on how we as a society deal with less serious drug-related crime.</P>
    <P>In February 1999 I established the Drug Court Planning Committee under the chairmanship of Judge Desmond Hogan. The remit of the committee is to initiate, develop and oversee a drug courts planning programme with clearly defined goals and objectives. They will assess the resource and infrastructural requirements of the programme setting out the likely costs and potential savings. Once the necessary preparatory work has been done they will report to me so that the necessary steps can be taken to establish the pilot project. The committee has had several meetings and sub-comittees, set up to consider specific aspects of the programme, have provided written and oral reports to the main committee. The planning committee is working towards providing a report to me by mid-1999 with a view to establishing the pilot programme before the end of the year.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the practice of plea bargaining in the courts as highlighted in a letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Chief State Solicitor in June 1998; and his views on the opinion expressed that, if this practice is to occur within this jurisdiction, it should be provided for by legislation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions has expressed reservations about the practice of discussing sentencing in chambers and has issued instructions to prosecuting counsel to discontinue the practice. He has expressed the view that if this practice is to occur within the jurisdiction, it should be provided for by legislation, after appropriate consideration of all the factors by relevant parties.</P>
      <P>This issue was discussed in the Law Reform Commission Report on Sentencing (August 1996). The Commission made no recommendation for legislation in the area of plea negotiations. It did state, however, that:</P>
      <P>If sentencing becomes more predictable as a result of the judiciary being better informed in general and having available to them a series of headline judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in different cases, there would be no need for such negotiations in chambers. Again, as the virtual inevitability of a discount after a plea is well established at this stage, it should be possible to obtain an indication in open court &ndash; even of the range of sentence that would be imposed and of the discount which could be anticipated &ndash; without consideration of aggravating or mitigating circumstances or previous convictions.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 8 of my Department's report arising from the early release from prison of Philip Sheedy recommends that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure should be asked &ldquo;to urgently review current practice in the courts in relation to plea negotiations&rdquo;. This matter is under consideration by the Government and I expect that an early decision will be made.</P>

      <P>However, I am aware that there are in excess of 180 applications for dismissal from wardship in respect of deceased wards waiting to be processed in the Office of Wards of Court. The time taken to deal with any given case depends on the issues involved, the nature of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and whether the affairs of the deceased were in order at the date of death. The Office of Wards of Court has informed me that, prior to the recent assignment of additional staff by me, the waiting time for completion of some of these applications could be up to two years.</P>
      <P>In view of the serious arrears problem in the office which arose because of historical staff shortages, five additional staff have been sanctioned at my request to eliminate delays in this area. I am informed that assignments have been made to four senior positions in the office. This includes three staff for new posts sanctioned. Arrangements to fill vacancies at the more junior level are now under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not possible at this stage to indicate a timescale for the elimination of arrears, I am satisfied that progress can be made within the next few months. In any event I have asked that a full review should be undertaken within 18 months. The target waiting time following the elimination of arrears is that there would be no <Col N="324" /> delay in processing applications in the Office of Wards of Court.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>Yes, I have examined the newspaper article in question. The situation regarding racism is cause for great concern to me. I have taken a number of steps to combat racism and intolerance towards minority ethnic groups including asylum seekers and refugees residing in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In July 1998, I established a National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. The committee is a partnership of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, State agencies, social partners and Government Departments. The objective of the committee is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against racism and to advise the Government on matters relating to racism and interculturalism. The committee will also endeavour to promote a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as refugees, travellers and other minority ethnic groups in Ireland. A sum of £21,000 was provided to the consultative committee to fund its programme of activities in 1998 and an allocation of £90,000 has been provided in 1999. The committee has also been provided with office premises and facilities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The committee's programme for the first quarter of 1999 included anti-racism training for certain civil servants dealing with minority groups, a seminar on the forthcoming Human Rights Commission and submissions, the setting up of a website, arranging a visit by groups from Northern Ireland, the establishment of a refugee and asylum seeker sub group, round table discussions on the integration of refugees and on monitoring the Legal Aid Service in the One Stop Shop.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that all student and probationer gardaí receive instruction in the area of race relations as part of their two year education and training programme. Specifically, the social studies element of the programme deals with discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping. It includes a seminar on ethnicity, traveller culture and discrimination against the travelling community. Pavee Point make a presentation at this seminar. The social studies course also covers instruction in human rights conferred by the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights and deals with policing and human rights. The legal studies element of the training and education programme provides instruction in the relevant provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989. In addition, all gardaí who act as immigration officers have received additional training from the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>As recently as last week, the Garda authorities hosted an international conference, co-funded by the EU Commission and the Government, entitled &ldquo;providing a police service in a developing multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Ireland&rdquo;. The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society. In particular, the training currently provided to student and probationer gardaí will be reviewed and enhanced in the light of the outcomes of this conference.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, which is expected to come into operation later this year, will outlaw discrimination on a number of grounds including race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin. Revised equal status legislation was published on 15 April 1999 and is expected to be enacted into law within the coming months. The Equal Status Bill, 1999, prohibits discrimination in non-employment areas, such as education, the provision of goods and services and accommodation on the same grounds as the Employment Equality Act, 1998</P>

      <P>I am aware of the survey which was conducted with employers in the context of the Northside Partnership's Jobsmatch project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care is without doubt one of the issues impacting on a parent's ability to avail of work, training and educational opportunities. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government decided <Col N="326" /> on 2 February to establish an interdepartmental committee on child care to evaluate, cost and prioritise proposals for the development of child care which are set out in recent reports on the matter.</P>
    <P>The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives, at senior level, of the relevant Government Departments. It is required to report back to Government within a period of six months. The committee has already met on five occasions to date.</P>
    <P>The Government announced new measures in December 1998 to support child care in the budget. The new measures provide for the introduction of a capital allowance for independent crèches and nurseries and employers or groups of employers in relation to capital expenditure incurred on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a building or part of a building used as a child care facility. They also provide exemption from benefit in kind taxation for certain child care facilities provided by employers to employees on a free or subsidised basis.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides funding for the development of child care facilities through the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme which is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment. It is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas and those on low pay who cannot access training, education and employment opportunities due to the lack of affordable good quality child care. The Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme is administered by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, on behalf of my Department. Funding is being provided under the following three initiatives: capital infrastructure &ndash; money is being targeted at community child care projects to enable them to upgrade-enhance their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need child care while they are at work or availing of training; community support projects &ndash; this fund is being used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for two full-time senior child care workers in community child care projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage;  employer demonstration initiative &ndash; this is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity child care facilities.</P>
    <P>Some additional EU funding was made available last week to my Department for the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme. This additional funding will be used to provide enhanced training for the community support projects referred to above, for expanding the services of the national voluntary child care organisations and for research into family-friendly policies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully supportive of all doctors being adequately trained in relation to the medical use of methadone. Apart from their general training, a number of prison doctors have additionally undertaken such training. I am continually seeking to improve the medical services available to offenders. The recruitment of nurses for the var<Col N="328" /> ious prisons is currently under way on a phased basis. Officials from my Department are involved in ongoing discussions with the EHB with a view to co-ordinating the provision of various drug treatment services.</P>
    <P>As the main committal institution in the State, misuse of drugs in the prison system is largely concentrated in Mountjoy Prison. A study by Dr Paul O'Mahony involving a random sample of 108 prisoners published by my Department, indicated that in 1996, 66 per cent of prisoners surveyed had a history of heroin use at some time in the past and that 42 per cent of the total sample had used heroin while in prison on the current occasion. A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling in and use of all kinds of contraband, including illegal drugs, in the prisons. These include improved visiting and searching facilities, video surveillance, increased vigilance by staff, and urine testing.</P>
    <P>All prisoners who show evidence of recent opiate abuse on committal to Mountjoy are offered a detoxification course which involves decreasing doses of methadone over a 14 day period. This regime may be altered where there are clinical indications that this is needed e.g. HIV positive prisoners and pregnant female prisoners. A small number of HIV positive prisoners in the medical unit in Mountjoy also receive methadone maintenance as part of their overall treatment for the HIV disease. A structured detoxification and counselling programme has been available in the drug free unit in Mountjoy since it opened in July 1996 This course can cater for nine prisoners every nine to ten weeks. One hundred and seventy four prisoners have successfully completed this programme to date with a further nine undertaking the programme at present.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are weekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings in the Medical Unit. Individual counselling is also available on request from the Probation and Welfare Service and voluntary organisations such as Anna Liffey, Coolmine Therapeutic Community and the Merchant's Quay Project who visit the prison regularly.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way and to this end I have recently approved a draft action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system. The plan builds on a medical policy which has been agreed between my Department and the EHB. The action plan provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance where this is considered medically appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue efforts to reduce the level of drug abuse in the prison system through the implementation of the drugs action plan and by reducing as far as possible the volume of drugs smuggled into the prisons. Progress in this area to date has been greatly hindered due to the constraints imposed by severe over<Col N="329" /> crowding in the committal prisons in recent years. This will be alleviated to a large extent later this year as more prison places come on stream in the new remand prison at Cloverhill, the new midland's prison and the new women's prison on the North Circular Road in Dublin. Finally, I should point out that the new Remand Prison at Cloverhill will deal with all remands in Dublin and surrounding counties for the foreseeable future and will have the capability to monitor more effectively attempts to smuggle drugs into that prison.</P>

      <P>The date 31 December 1999 has been declared a public holiday in recognition of the uniqueness of the occasion in all of our lifetimes. There are, however, sectors where it may be necessary for employees to attend work on 31 December.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that in certain industrial sectors, such as the hotel and catering sector and the information technology and related sectors, there will be a requirement for a large number of employees to be present at their places of work on this special day. In the public sector, indications from the gardaí and the health services and others engaged in essential services, are that the occasion will result in increased labour requirements for the millennium weekend.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements for occasions such as the New Year's Eve holiday are in the normal course of industrial relations, matters to be addressed through negotiation between employers and employees involved, or their representatives.</P>
      <P>Workers do, of course, have minimum statutory rights and entitlements under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, in relation to work on public holidays and these must be fully respected. It is of particular importance in relation to the occasion in question, that attention should be paid to such matters as maximum hours of work, hours of rest, and night work. Furthermore, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 prohibits the employment of 16-17 year olds beyond 10 p.m. as a matter of health and safety.</P>
      <P>I am aware of statements from both the employers organisations and trade unions on the matter of remuneration for work on the 31 December 1999. To the extent that there are claims for arrangements beyond the minima, I would see these as matters for negotiation between the parties themselves. I would urge all concerned to work together in ensuring that 31 December will be a good occasion for everybody.</P>

Participants are engaged by sponsors of projects and the specific terms and conditions under which they are engaged are matters for negotiation between sponsors and participants, subject of course to the terms of the contract FÁS have with the sponsor being met.</P>
      <P>With regard to services provided directly by FÁS, including advice or guidance provided by FÁS staff to unemployed persons, before, during or following completion of a period on community employment, complaints procedure already exists whereby clients of FÁS can refer unresolved disputes to the FÁS Client Services Commissioner. The commissioner's investigations and recommendations are carried out independently and impartially and he can be contacted at P.O. Box 5656, 27-33 Upper Baggot Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>Assistance for small businesses and services in Ireland is delivered by a large number of bodies, including county and city enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. In particular, the 35 city and county enterprise boards, which were established in 1993, support the development of small enterprises, ten employees or fewer, through a range of measures, including direct and indirect enterprise supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct financial assistance is provided by way of: capital grants to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of capital and other investment, or £50,000, whichever is the lesser; employment grants of up to £5,000 in respect of each new full-<Col N="333" /> time job created in an eligible enterprise, subject to a limit of ten jobs; feasibility study grants where a maximum of 75 per cent of the cost of preparing a feasibility study and business plan may be provided, subject to an overall limit of £5,000.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to direct capital or employment grants, the enterprise boards may take equity in a project subject to an overall maximum financial intervention of £50,000.</P>
    <P>The boards also provide business information/ advice, counselling and monitoring and support for the development of management skills.</P>
    <P>Since their establishment, the enterprise boards have assisted the creation of an estimated 15,500 jobs. This is firm evidence of the effectiveness of the measures deployed by the enterprise boards to support job creation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should add that a comprehensive guide &ldquo;Starting Your Own Business&rdquo; was published by our Department, with assistance from the European Commission in 1998. This publication gives details of the supports available to enterprises and how they may be accessed through the different development agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a <Col N="335" /> required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students. I have also exhorted my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to pursue his Department's examination of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have re-established the motor insurance advisory board which is to advise me on the charges for motor insurance and the methods for providing motor insurance between different risk categories of drivers having regard to accidents and claims. The expanded membership of the new board, which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, is broadly representative of all of the interests concerned including road safety education and enforcement experts.</P>
    <P>Certain concessions to young drivers have been introduced previously by major insurers in the Irish market against the background of increasing underwriting losses in motor insurance. The 1997 annual insurance report prepared by our Department, showed that motor insurance underwriting losses increased from £90 million in 1996 to £114 million in 1997. The deteriorating underwriting situation resulted in some insurers implementing increases in certain insurance categories in 1998.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, there is clearly no soft option for reducing motor insurance premiums for young inexperienced drivers. As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluctant to quote for that risk. As in any other branch of insurance risk, reductions in premiums can only be achieved by improved safety standards. In the case of young Irish motorists, the inculcation of safer driving standards and education in driving skills and the early acquisition of a driving licence, is the key to reducing their high accident rate which, in turn, should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main public offices operated by my Department are located as follows: Leeson Lane, Dublin 2; Beggars Bush, Dublin 4; Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo; Johns<Col N="340" /> town Castle, County Wexford, Forest Service; 26-27 Eden Quay, Dublin 1; Government Buildings, O'Sullivans Quay, Cork.</P>
      <P>These offices, with the exception of the Eden Quay premises, are fully accessible to all members of the public. The premises at Eden Quay houses the Department's Marine Survey Office and the Mercantile Marine Office. As the Marine Survey Office is based in the upper floors of this building and there is no lift facility, access for people with disabilities is difficult. Arrangements are currently being made to re-locate the offices to my Department's Head Office in Leeson Lane, Dublin 2, which will remove the difficulties currently being encountered.</P>
      <P>In addition to its main office at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, the Forest Service operates some 14 local offices where its forestry inspectors are based. These offices are accessible to people with disabilities. My Department also manages and runs five fishery harbour centres at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveal and Killybegs. Harbour users may have occasion to visit the harbour master's office at these fishing ports. However, given the nature of the harbour master's job, such offices are usually located at the upper level of the harbour buildings so as to afford a clear view of harbour operations. This does result in an access difficulty for people with disabilities. However, in such circumstances, the relevant harbour master will arrange to meet in a more suitable location.</P>
      <P>In regard to the bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, a number of these operate public offices. The question of access is set out below: An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Crofton Road, Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, access for people with disabilities provided; Harbour Authorities-Port Companies, there are 16 Harbour Authorities and nine Port Companies: facilities used by the public at these ports &ndash; e.g. passenger facilities, are accessible. However, in certain instances, the office facilities are only accessible with assistance. All new facilities are constructed in a manner to provide full access to all members of the public; Marine Institute, 80 Harcourt Street, Dublin 2: accessible by people with disabilities; Coillte Teoranta, Leeson Lane, Dublin 2 access facilities provided; central and regional fisheries boards: the offices of the Central Fisheries Board in Glasnevin, Dublin 9, is, apart from a small step at the main entrance, generally accessible to all members of the public. The offices of the seven regional boards are in the main accessible. However, the Shannon and North Western Regional Fisheries Boards do not have access facilities. The boards are very conscious of the needs of people in the community with a disability and indeed provide various programmes and facilities to anglers with a disability.</P>

      <P>The private sector has undoubtedly become an important factor in international development co-operation and has a major role to play in providing resources for development.</P>
      <P>The Global Sustainable Development Facility &ndash; GSDF &ndash; is a new concept developed by the United Nations Development Programme to try to bridge the gap between the interests of corporations and financial institutions in profit and the interests of the United Nations in development. It is intended to support innovative and practical actions that will meet the UNDPs goal of sustainable human development and poverty reduction while at the same time providing necessary economic incentives for the private sector.</P>
      <P>I understand that a number of NGOs have levelled criticism at the UNDP for proposing this initiative, implying that the organisation has compromised its principles in so doing.</P>
      <P>The UNDP Administrator, Mr. James Gustave Speth, in response to such criticism, has stressed that the UNDP's dialogue with companies has focused on areas specifically related to poverty alleviation &ndash; for example combining electrification and telecommunications projects with enterprise and community development, or exploring with banks ways in which they might make resources available for microfinancing &ndash; initiatives which contribute to poverty eradication while being financially viable.</P>
      <P>The UNDP has undertaken to ensure that all projects coming under the GSDF Initiative meet rigorous criteria and are in compliance with all standards that the United Nations stand by. There is no question of the UNDP harming its own credibility and independence for the sake of co-operation with the corporate sector.</P>
      <P>Administrator Speth has pointed out that the GSDF is not intended to be a fund-raising instrument. As a condition for participating in the dialogue with the UNDP, corporations have had to commit the time of a senior executive as well as $50,000 under a very strict co-financing agreement that spells out very clearly the rights and obligations of the parties. In no circumstances does this include the right to use the United Nations or UNDP name or logo.</P>
      <P>As a current member of the executive board of the UNDP, Ireland is in a position to monitor UNDP policy, including the concerns raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am sending the Deputy a copy of the administrator's reply to a number of individuals and NGO representatives who had raised concerns on the GSDF.</P>

      <P>While incidents arising from the military missions carried out in the no-fly zones of northern and southern Iraq are reported in the media, detailed statistics are not normally provided. According to the coalition of countries which monitor these zones, the cease-fire agreement which ended the 1991 war empowers them to impose such controls over Iraqi military flights.</P>
      <P>The effects of the UN sanctions are felt most acutely by the most vulnerable. Various figures are given for infant mortality due to the malnutrition of mothers and shortages of paediatric pharmaceuticals. The overall infant mortality rate calculated by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the latest detailed figures are for 1995, was 129 per thousand births. This is not only a tragically high rate by international standards, but represents an increase of more than 100 per cent over the 1990 figure of 64 per thousand births.</P>
      <P>The use of chemical weapons by the current Iraqi regime against its own citizens has been fully investigated and established to the satisfaction of the international community. The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iraq and other observers have shown in several reports evidence of such use.</P>
      <P>In the framework of its continuing work for full implementation of all UN Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq, the Security Council earlier this year established three panels &ndash; on disarmament, humanitarian assistance and prisoners of war &ndash; to study how to achieve this goal. These panels reported to the Security Council on 7 April.</P>
      <P>The disarmament panel recommended the installation of a reinforced system of ongoing monitoring and verification.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian panel recommended the stimulation of the local Iraqi economy by raising the oil production ceiling and asking non-Iraqi companies to make the necessary investment in oil industry spare parts, which could add $300 million every six months to the humanitarian programme for Iraq.</P>
      <P>The panel on Kuwaiti prisoners of war urged Iraq to resume attendance at the meetings of the tripartite commission set up to address this issue, and of its technical sub-committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> The recommendations of the three panels are currently under discussion in the Security Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches great importance to the work of the special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the distinguished Malaysian jurist Mr. Param Cumaraswamy. Since his appointment, the special rapporteur has pursued his mandate with diligence and zeal.</P>
      <P>We especially value the work of the special rapporteur in relation to Northern Ireland. He has drawn attention last year, and again this year, to allegations of the intimidation and harassment of defence lawyers in Northern Ireland. This issue, as well as the individual cases highlighted by the special rapporteur, have been raised with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the special rapporteur, in his 1999 report, which was published before the murder of Rosemary Nelson, again drew attention to allegations of intimidation against her, which he had addressed in his 1998 report. He has subsequently expressed his outrage at her murder. The Government shares the widespread concern that the investigation into this appalling crime should be demonstrably independent, thorough and effective. Discussions are ongoing in connection with the conduct of the investigation. In particular, the Government has emphasised that all those who may have relevant information or be potential witnesses must feel free to come forward.</P>
      <P>We recognise fully the legitimate interest of the international human rights community, including the special rapporteur, in this investigation, and will continue to urge the relevant authorities to take this fully into account.</P>
      <P>The special rapporteur has also repeated his call for an independent judicial inquiry into the murder some ten years ago of Patrick Finucane, another defence lawyer.</P>
      <P>On 12 February 1999 the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, met with the widow of Pat Finucane. At this meeting, she received a copy of a new report by British-Irish Rights Watch into allegations of collusion and a copy of the report was presented the same day to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of the report has been prepared in the Department of Foreign Affairs and is also <Col N="344" /> currently the subject of discussions with the British side. I am aware of media reports about the Government's position regarding a public inquiry, including the publication in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> of leaked Government documents. As the Government's discussions with the British authorities are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, through Ireland's missions to the United Nations, has been actively engaged in preparing for the UN Year of Older Persons, 1999. It has also participated in meetings of the National Steering Committee for the UN Year of Older Persons, set up by the National Council on Ageing and Older People &ndash; NCAOP &ndash; on the request of the Department of Health and Children. The National Steering Committee, which has met about every two months since its establishment in early 1999, has had a co-ordinating role in marking the year in Ireland. The Department of Foreign Affairs has, in particular, provided information to the committee on activities undertaken to mark the UN Year of Older Persons in the international context.</P>

This Covenant recognises, <i>inter alia, </i>the right to work and to free choice of employment, to fair wages, to form and join trade unions, to social security, to an adequate standard of living, to the highest attainable standard of health, to an education and the right to take part in cultural life.</P>

The substance of this report covers a very broad range of issues involving primarily the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health, Education and Social, Community and Family Affairs and those Departments will be represented at the examination.

      <P>Last week I announced that the Government had decided on an eight-fold increase, from £1/4 million to £2 million, in the Department of Foreign Affairs Reconciliation Fund for 1999.</P>
      <P>This 800 per cent increase in the reconciliation fund fulfils the Governments pledge in the Good Friday Agreement to positively examine the case for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation. I hope this very substantial increase in the Government's funding for reconciliation will not only enhance the valuable and vital work being carried out by the organisations involved in reconciliation, but will also encourage the development of significant and imaginative new initiatives.</P>
      <P>Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs are currently evaluating applications for assistance in 1999 from the reconciliation fund, including one received, through Deputy Bruton, in early April from a band in County Fermanagh. I hope to announce a number of allocations from the 1999 reconciliation fund in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 to 128, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Aer Rianta submitted a report to me on the future strategic direction of the Aer Rianta Group on 15 April 1999. The future of the Great Southern Hotel Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aer Rianta cpt., has been included in that report and therefore all options in relation to the Hotel Group will be considered in that context. The Minister for Finance and I have jointly appointed a team of advisers, led by Warburg Dillon Read, to assist us both in our examination of the Aer Rianta report and to advise on the full range of recommendations made in that report. I do not have any plans for a separate study into the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group. It is expected that the consultants will take about two months to complete their work. Adequate time will be allowed for the staff of the Great Southern Hotel Group to consider their own future and to make their views fully known, in a consultative way, before any final decisions will be taken on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to employee share ownership schemes in commercial State companies, I have already stated that such schemes will be considered on a case by case basis with the best interests of each company in mind and that remains my position.</P>
      <P>In regard to the valuation placed on the hotel group, the position is that valuations are carried out on behalf of Aer Rianta every five years by property valuation consultants under specific criteria set down in accordance with accounting standards. The last valuation was undertaken in 1994 and the Aer Rianta group accounts are based on that valuation. A further valuation is due to be carried out later this year and will be particularly necessary in the event that the proposal by Aer Rianta to exit from the hotel business is approved by the Government.</P>

      <P>The relocation of naval service headquarters to Haulbowline and air corps headquarters to Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel was one of the recommendations of the recent review of the naval service and air corps. I have directed that with effect from 1 July 1999, naval service headquarters will be located at the naval base, Haulbowline and air corps headquarters at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. All issues, including the deployment of personnel are being examined in the general context of relocation planning which is ongoing at present. The naval service are in the process of identifying possible suitable appointments in the defence forces in the Dublin area into which naval service headquarters staff who do not wish to relocate to the naval base, Haulbowline might be transferred.</P>

      <P>Since 1996 inspectors from my Department have been visiting farmers who have land annuity arrears with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment. If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period. On the other hand if it is found that there is no valid reason for non-payment my Department has to consider offsetting of any grants due or taking legal action in the matter.</P>

      <P>Details are set out in the following table. In summary, the final Agenda 2000 deal will mean a gain of £395 million to farm income over the period 2000-2006, and the national gain over the period will be even greater, £666 million, because of the additional domestic benefits from lower product prices.</P>
      <P>This is in marked contrast to the original detailed Commission proposals of March 1998, which would have cost Irish farmers up to £233 million in the first year after all the changes were phased in in 2003. The total cost to farmers would have been £1,386 million over the seven year period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The agreement as finalised by the European Council in Berlin on 24-26 March 1999 will result in a much reduced loss of £14 million in the first year after all changes have been phased in, and this does not occur until 2007.</P>

      <P>All the lands declared by the person named on her area aid forms for the years 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997 were incorrectly processed as disadvantaged for those years, and payment of full headage grants issued. However, it was discovered in 1998 that part of her land was in fact non-disadvantaged and did not qualify for headage. Since payment is based on the total forage area declared by headage applicants, and not just on the disadvantaged land, the person named fell due to be paid on a split-holding basis for the years 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. Consequently, the applicant was overpaid in the years in question and these amounts must now be recouped.</P>

Until all of the applications received by 23 April 1999 have been registered, it is not possible to say how many pre-printed applications were not returned. Under EU regulations any applications received after the closing date will incur a penalty deduction of 1 per cent of any aid payable for each working day that the application is late up to 25 days.

      <P>Detailed proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in late 1997 but these proposals were not activated by them because of concerns in regard to their internal controls on specified offals. Despite considerable contacts and discussions they have not altered their position. In the meantime the nature of the Egyptian market has changed for Ireland. In 1998, Egypt became the largest market for Irish beef importing 120,000 tonnes of beef, which is the equivalent of over 350,000 head of cattle. Exports in the first three months of this year have been maintained at the same level as last year. Regular contact with the Egyptian authorities is essential in view of the importance of the market and my recent visit to the Cairo food fair and my meetings with the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Trade and Supply were part of this process.</P>

      <P>However, notwithstanding the above, applications cannot be accepted where an existing farming unit has been split to facilitate the creation of two or more farming units in order to circumvent the eligible area limit of 40 hectares and thereby enhance the level of REPS payment.

    <P>I understand that the former Phoenix Park racecourse is in private ownership. Consequently any question regarding racing returning to that venue is one which should be addressed to the owners. I also understand that the Irish Horseracing Authority has not been approached by the owners of the site regarding racing returning to that venue.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 18 animals under the 1998 cattle headage scheme. His application was received in the local livestock office on 5 May 1998, and under the terms and conditions of the scheme, he undertook to retain all the animals until 6 July 1998. At an inspection of his herd on 30 June 1998 it was noted that eight of the animals had been sold inside the retention period and had not been replaced. The person named was informed that he was not entitled to any grants under clause 31 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme, which states that where rejected animals exceed 20 per cent of the <Col N="365" /> eligible animals found, no grants are payable. This decision was reviewed by the district inspector on 2 March 1999 but the review was unsuccessful. The person named was notified of the results of the review and was given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the independent headage and premia appeals unit, but as yet has not done so.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in receipt of any information which would suggest that Irish food companies are not being afforded equal supply opportunities by overseas controlled supermarket chains operating in Ireland. Given the free trading conditions which apply here and throughout the European Union, neither am I in a position to determine the basis on which purchasing decisions in relation to individual products are taken by these or indeed any other retail companies operating here.</P>
      <P>As is the case with all other sectors of industry, the extent to which our food industry can maintain and expand its market position will be determined by its ability to function successfully in today's competitive climate. The current development strategy for the food industry &ndash; the food sub-programme &ndash; has enhanced the competitiveness of the sector. Its range of support measures has encouraged greater productivity and increased efficiencies. Allied to the market-oriented nature of the strategy, these have assisted the industry to increase total output by £2.2 billion and exports by £1.1 billion over the 1994 to 1998 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food industry development group, which was established under the aegis of my Department, has also highlighted the need for continuing attention to competitiveness and market orientation. The group's report points out that the competitive pressures on the industry will increase and that the extent to which it can meet growth opportunities depends on its competitiveness and capabilities in terms of price, quality, variety, innovation and service. The group recom<Col N="366" /> mends a continuation of the actions undertaken in the food sub-programme. That recommendation is being considered in the context of the new national development plan and the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The research carried out by the veterinary laboratory services of my Department on diseases of livestock or domestic animals is concentrated mainly on scheduled and/or notifiable diseases under national and EU legislation. Research is also carried out on parasitic diseases of economic importance in domestic animals. Most of the research is carried out at the central veterinary research laboratory, Abbotstown, which currently employs 114. There are also five regional veterinary laboratories located at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Sligo. A total of 62 staff are employed at these regional veterinary laboratories and a percentage of their work would be in the research area.</P>

    <P>The Department also operates testing facilities, which while not pure research, come under the general heading of research and development. Crop variety testing is carried out at Backweston, the Cereal Station, Ballinacurra, various field trials on private farms with the owner's co-operation and at the agricultural colleges at Kildalton, Ballyhaise and Athenry. Bull performance testing is carried out at Tully, County Kildare and on farms of pedigree breeders participating in <Col N="367" /> recording schemes. Maintenance of potato varieties, especially with regard to freedom from virus diseases, using meristem culture, is undertaken at the potato farm, Raphoe. Seed testing is carried out at the seed testing station, Abbotstown. A total of 64 staff are employed on testing in these locations, some of whom would also have responsibility for areas other than testing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together. In this context I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis of the treatment of married persons for tax purposes derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax-free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I should explain that in the Hyland case in 1989, the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple. This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. This group is due to report later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The death duties referred to by the Deputy involve capital acquisitions tax (CAT) and probate tax. The position is as follows in regard to the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Transfers between spouses do not give rise to any charge to CAT, either on death or by means of a gift. Furthermore there is a full exemption from probate tax for the surviving spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of all unmarried couples the survivor would pay CAT and probate tax on the following basis. For the current year the qualifying threshold for an inheritance taken from an unrelated person is £12,860. This &ldquo;Class III&rdquo; threshold is indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index. Where the beneficiary has received previous inheritances since 2 December 1998, the value of these benefits is added to the value of the current benefit when determining the CAT liability. The rate of CAT on inheritances is nil up to the appropriate threshold rate, 20 per cent <Col N="370" /> on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance.</P>
    <P>Probate tax, introduced in 1993 is charged at a rate of 2 per cent on the net value of non-exempt assets left by the deceased, whether the assets pass under a will or intestacy. For the current year, estates with a taxable value of £11,250 or less are exempt from probate tax. Furthermore any outstanding debts of the deceased, as well as funeral expenses, may be deducted as expenses of the estate in arriving at the taxable value. Jointly-owned property, which passes automatically from one joint owner to another joint owner is not subject to probate tax.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the issues which the Deputy has raised. I recently undertook in the Dáil that prior to the next budget, I would examine the CAT code in some detail bearing these issues in mind. Any changes in the CAT area are costly and, for this reason, must therefore be looked at in a budgetary context when choices have to be made on which elements of the tax system to address.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Eastern Health Board in June of 1998 adopted a report &ldquo;10 Year Action Plan for Services for Older Persons 1999 &ndash; 2008&rdquo; which is a comprehensive statement of intent in which the board targeted the provision of a range of services for older persons into the new millennium. The report covers the full spectrum of services for <Col N="375" /> older persons with detailed recommendations and costings.</P>
      <P>This report follows on from the report &ldquo;Review of Services for the Elderly, a 4 Year Action Plan 1995 &ndash; 1998&rdquo;  which was adopted by the Eastern Health Board in 1995 and which has been almost entirely implemented.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that the following is a summary of the additional services brought on stream during the lifetime of the four year action plan and in the first year of the ten year action plan in relation to Dublin north city and county:</P>
      <P>&ndash;46 bed community nursing units including day unit for older persons at Cuan Ros, Navan Road;</P>
      <P>&ndash;25 bed community nursing unit at Sir Patrick Duns, Grand Canal Street (accessed in part by north Dublin city and county services);</P>

      <P>&ndash;40 longstay or respite beds at St. Monica's Home, Belvedere Place, Dublin 7;</P>
      <P>&ndash;85 additional contract beds in private nursing homes;</P>
      <P>&ndash;additional post of consultant physician in medicine for the elderly is currently being processed;</P>
      <P>&ndash;additional resources for home help services (rates of pay and increased funding);</P>
      <P>&ndash;50-bed community nursing unit including day unit at St. Clare's Home, Griffith Ave. extension has been completed and the staff are currently being recruited; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;an additional five community ward teams have been allocated to the North Dublin city-county area.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that a key element of the ten year action plan is the provision of a number of community units for older persons including day units strategically located in the Eastern Health Board area to meet the full range of in-patient services including day services for a local catchment population. In this regard sites have been identified for such units at Lusk, Beaumont, Raheny and Fairview and for a second unit at St. Clare's, Griffith Avenue extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>As the determination of in-patient appointments is a matter for the hospital authorities in the first instance, based on a clinical assessment of need, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Mater Hospital to investigate the position regarding this patient. Given the particular circumstances of this case, I have requested that he reply to the Deputy directly, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question, regarding the numbers of patients treated during 1998, I would like to state that my Department does not collect data on the numbers of private patients treated in commercial hospitals. However I can confirm that between the 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1998, 1,146 adult cardiac surgery operations were carried out on public patients and 145 on private patients in the public system. In relation to paediatric cardiac surgery, I am advised that a total of 243 patients were treated in the public system, of which approximately 183 were public patients.</P>
      <P>The cardiac waiting list initiative is targeted exclusively at public patients and under the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, a total of £2.3 million was allocated for the treatment of an additional 265 public cardiac patients. Due to problems of public capacity, my Department contracted with the commercial hospitals for the treatment of 100 patients. The impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting (adults and children) at the end of December 1998 by 142. This represents a reduction of over 10 per cent on the figure for December 1997.</P>
      <P>In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, I am currently finalising the arrangements for this year's initiative, which I hope to announce soon. I am confident that this will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on cardiac surgery waiting lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University Col<Col N="377" /> lege Hospital, Galway will contribute greatly towards this objective. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an employed person aged 21 and over in a family household and a person aged 24 in October 1999 in full-time education are treated as independent adults under the drugs payment scheme and as dependants in determining household income for medical card eligibility; his views on whether these two positions are inconsistent; the instrument used to implement recent changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11360/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that everyone who is ordinarily resident in Ireland has either category one or category two eligibility for health services, depending on personal income. People with category one eligibility receive a medical card and can avail of services under the general medical services (GMS) scheme. Entitlement to a medical card is means tested and depends on personal income and circumstances. A medical card normally covers the card holder, his or her spouse and any children under 16. It also covers people over 16, such as students, who are dependant on the medical card holder. The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependent or not is made by the relevant health board on the basis of personal circumstances. Similarly, in the case of an individual who is living in the family home and who is applying for a medical card in his or her own right, health boards take the individual's income and circumstances into account when deciding on the application.</P>
      <P>People who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, but who do not qualify for a medical card, automatically have category two eligibility and are entitled to services available to people in this category, including the community drugs schemes. In the case of the community drugs schemes, the Health Act, 1970 provides for health boards to meet the balance of the cost or proportion thereof of expenditure incurred by a person on drugs, medicines and surgical appliances which were prescribed by a registered medical practitioner and were for the treatment of the person or his or her dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug payments scheme (DPS) is being introduced with effect from July 1999 and will replace two existing community drugs schemes, the drug refund scheme (DRS) and the drug cost subsidisation scheme (DCSS). As with the DRS and the DCSS, regulations will be made in respect of the DPS prior to its introduction. Under the DPS, a person or his or her depend<Col N="379" /> ants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances for use by that person or his or her dependants in that month. For the purposes of the scheme, dependants includes spouse and children under 18 years. A dependant with a physical disability or a mental handicap or illness who cannot maintain himself or herself fully, who is ordinarily resident in the family home and who does not hold a current medical card, may be included in the family expenditure under this scheme, regardless of age. Dependants over 18 years and under the age of 23 years who are in full-time education are also included. The upper age limit is in keeping with recent family law legislation. A person over the age of 18 years, and who is not in full-time education, can of course avail of the DPS in his or her own right or may be eligible for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The GMS scheme and the DPS are two separate schemes, one of which is means tested while the other is not. As indicated earlier, health boards take account of personal circumstances when deciding on an application for a medical card. If an individual is not eligible for a medical card, he or she is automatically entitled to avail of the DPS. I do not regard the approach taken as inconsistent. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I would be happy to make inquiries from the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>Claims by the tobacco industry that consumption of lighter brands of cigarettes reduces the risk of lung cancer for smokers and are less dangerous to health are unfounded.

      <P>I have seen reports of the study referred to by the <Col N="383" /> Deputy. It is a matter in the first place for intending travellers to countries where certain infectious diseases are prevalent to familiarise themselves with the general advice on immunisation for travellers to the country concerned. Advice and information is obtainable through general practitioners, health boards, travel health centres, travel agents or the embassy or consulate of the country which it is intended to visit. In addition to the traditional immunisation advice, intending travellers should also consider seeking advice on a range of other issues, for example whether they are medically fit to travel, what medical provision should be made for individuals with pre-existing illness and what general precautions should be taken in relation to eating, drinking and exposure to a different environment from that to which people are accustomed.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that under the terms of Sections 10(1)(e) and 12(1)(b) of the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act, 1995, among the information which organisers of package holidays are required to make available to possible consumers is information about health formalities required by national administrations for the journey and the stay.</P>
      <P>My Department publishes material containing general health advice for persons planning to travel abroad and this deals with the risks of infectious disease and the desirability of ensuring that intending travellers to at-risk countries obtain the appropriate vaccinations, as well as some of the other issues to which I have referred. The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is currently reviewing its immunisation guidelines for Ireland and this includes an examination of the advice to medical professionals on immunisation for persons travelling abroad. My Department will be arranging for the distribution of the revised guidelines, when completed, to a range of interested parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition. Children are assessed therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department in 1985, to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped. The guide<Col N="384" /> lines provide the criteria that should be applied in assessing degrees of priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment. Patients with extreme handicapping malocclusions are assessed as category B. One criterion for assessing a malocclusion as extreme and handicapping is where the horizontal overjet is equal to or greater than 10 millimetres.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland recommends immunisation against hepatitis B for patients and carers in institutions for persons with mental handicap. Additional revenue funding of £300,000 was provided to the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies by my Department in 1995 to enable the provision of hepatitis B vaccination for staff working in the mental handicap services and for client groups considered to be at risk. This funding has continued to be provided in the agencies' budgets. The question of additional funding in 1999 for the provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for certain at-risk groups is currently being examined by my Department. I am not yet in a position to comment on the level of funding which will be available to my Department in 2000.</P>
      <P>In June 1997 the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies were requested to review ongoing arrangements to ensure that all at-risk clients have been identified and scheduled for immunisation. As a result of this request the public health department of the Eastern Health Board undertook a review of the current hepatitis B vaccination programme. This report is now being submitted to the health board management for their consideration. This is the procedure followed by the board in relation to all such reports. I understand that it is the intention of the board to make copies of the report available to the mental handicap agencies as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The national cancer strategy is aimed at reorganising and developing cancer services throughout the country. The regional director of cancer services in the South-Eastern Health Board has submitted a plan to my Department, for the development of cancer services in the region, with the prior approval of the board. This plan prioritises the board's needs and requirements for the development of the service, and outlines proposals for increased links with the existing radiotherapy centre at St Luke's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service. Because of its complexity and the considerable cost involved, there are currently just two public radiotherapy facilities in Ireland. These are in St Luke's Hospital, Dublin and Cork University Hospital. However, I am pleased to say that a third public radiotherapy facility will be provided as part of the major development of University College Hospital, Galway. I also recently approved the provision of a second linear accelerator for the radiotherapy unit at Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <Quest>the number of residential places available for drug treatment in the Eastern Health Board area; the average duration of stay; the waiting list for admission; and the assessment, if any, carried out of the success rate of these methods of treatment and the need to provide additional places.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has a 17-bed residential unit in Cuan Dara at Cherry Orchard Hospital. In addition, there is a ten bed unit in Beaumont Hospital. The board also provides funding to voluntary organisations to enable them to provide in-patient and residential services. The main organisations involved are Merchant's Quay who have a 12 bed facility at High Park, Drumcondra, Coolmine Therapeutic Centre who have 68 beds (50 men, 18 women) and Cuan Mhuire in Athy who have 20 beds.</P>
      <P>The preferred treatment option for drug misuse is out-patient treatment, where the person, in his or her own local area, with the assistance of counselling and community and voluntary services and the support of family members, can be motivated to break his or her drug taking habit and decide to work towards achieving a drug-free lifestyle. It must be acknowledged, however, that in some cases, especially in the short term, this is not a realistic option and for this reason a range of treatment responses are required. Admission to in-patient facilities is determined following individual assessment of needs and motivation by the multi-disciplinary team led by the consultant psychiatrist.</P>
      <P>The average length of stay in Cuan Dara and Beaumont is 21 days. There is roughly a five-week waiting list for assessment at both units, with a two-month waiting list for admission in Cuan Dara and a four to six week waiting list for admission in Beaumont.</P>
      <P>In-patient treatment services provide detoxification and early rehabilitation with short stays from two weeks to 12 weeks maximum. In-patient services have significantly higher rates of completion of detoxification for opiate dependants than out-patient or community settings. All who are referred have failed in the community setting. A significant number of inpatient detoxification patients go on to residential rehabilitation facilities.</P>
      <P>The current level of provision compares favourably with international figures where the average provision of these facilities appears to range between 0.5 and 1.5 per 100,000 adult population.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of in-patient detoxification in Cuan Dara was carried out over a one-year period. There were 159 admissions to the unit during the year and an initial evaluation has shown that 26 per cent of patients remained drug free when followed up after ten weeks. This is in line with research published in the United Kingdom which looked at 54 different centres providing drug misuse treatment in that country and Irish figures compare favourably with those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> The board will continue to expand its treatment and rehabilitation facilities during 1999. It is developing a 12-bed in-patient short-stay unit in Cherry Orchard Hospital and also a 20-bed downstream detoxification unit in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>During 1999 an evaluation of all of the board's drug treatment services, including detoxification, will be carried out to review the appropriateness of the board's service response to drug misusers. A decision on whether additional in-patient treatment facilities are required will be made in the context of this evaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of reducing waiting times in all specialties as much as possible. It is, of course, open to each consultant to review his or her waiting lists and to treat individual patients sooner, in light of changing clinical priorities.</P>
      <P>I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million to services for older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists; and the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator or bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient <Col N="390" /> waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
    <P>The policy circular reiterates the targets of treating adults in target specialties within 12 months, and of treating children in target specialties within six months.</P>

      <P>I referred the matters raised in the Deputy's question to the regulatory bodies with responsibility for this area. I have already forwarded the information received from the Dental Council to the Deputy in my reply to the Deputy's previous question for answer on Wednesday, 21 April 1999.  The Medical Council has now advised my Department as follows.</P>
      <P>In respect of users of ionising radiation for medical purposes, the Medical Council recognises qualified personnel and permitted personnel. Qualified personnel are radiologists, physicians with a degree in nuclear medicine and radiographers. The Medical Council accepts these groups as being fully qualified to use ionising radiation by virtue of their training. Permitted personnel are non-radiologist hospital doctors and non-nuclear physician hospital doctors who are required to undertake a short course in radiation protection and techniques before using ionising radiation in the course of their practise of medicine. Such courses are approved by the Medical Council and the faculty of radiologists.</P>
      <P>On a regular basis, course organisers submit to the Medical Council the names of the registered medical practitioners who have attended each course and following consultation with the faculty of radiologists, eligible doctors are advised of the procedures to apply for certification by the Medical Council of their attendance at an approved course.  The current lists of participants in approved courses, retained by the council, contains the names of 314 medical practitioners, which excludes radiologists and nuclear physicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Medical Council does not maintain an exhaustive list of radiologists, physicians in nuclear medicine or radiographers. Figures compiled by Comhairle na-nOspideal indicate than on 1 January 1999 there were 106 consultant radiologists in public hospitals and four in private <Col N="391" /> practice. The number of radiographers in practice in Ireland is approximately 900.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council has notified all licensees of x-ray equipment for medical purposes of the provisions of the European Communities (Medical Ionizing Radiation) Regulations, 1988 and sought the names of all personnel using medical ionizing radiation, with evidence of their competence to do so in accordance with the directive.</P>
    <P>I have forwarded for the attention of the Deputy a copy of the council's policy document in regard to users of radiation for medical purposes.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of these regulations states that a person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure that no corporal punishment is inflicted on a pre-school child attending the service. Section 27 states that a person carrying on a pre-school service shall take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children attending the service.</P>
      <P>My Department issued guidelines on the identification, investigation and management of child abuse in 1987. These guidelines specify that if a person suspects child abuse he or she should notify the health board immediately. These guidelines are currently being revised and expanded by a working group which I established in February 1998. I expect to receive the new guidelines in early June.</P>
      <P>The Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998 is also relevant in this context. The Act provides immunity from civil liability to any person who reports child abuse &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; to designated officers of health boards or any member of An Garda Síochána. It also provides significant protections from penalisation from their employers for employees who report child abuse. This Act came into operation on 23 January 1999.</P>

      <P>Research in the area of electromagnetic radiation is carried out by bodies like the World Health Organisation, the International Radiation Protection Association and the International Com<Col N="393" /> mission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. I am advised that the general body of scientific evidence to date has not established substantive evidence of any adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields generated by mobile phone masts.</P>
      <P>Research is ongoing and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the international EMF project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields. This project is being carried out over a five year period and will bring together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments.</P>
      <P>At EU level the Council of Health Ministers is currently considering a recommendation on the subject of public exposure to electromagnetic fields. This recommendation if adopted will establish a European wide standard which each member state will apply to its own country. The measure as currently drafted provides <i>inter alia</i> for a system of ongoing monitoring of the ambient exposure of the public to electromagnetic fields from all sources including mobile phone masts.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports this measure and I will make a further statement on the matter when the European measure has been finalised.</P>

      <P>A brief for a major extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to serve Westport, Louisburgh, Newport and Mulranny an estimated cost of almost £21 million, was received in my Department in April 1998. The local authority was subsequently requested to review the proposal in the light of approvals under the serviced land initiative of water supply augmentation schemes for Newport and Mulranny. Following this review, Mayo County Council submitted a proposal last February for a phased approach, Phase One of which would involve an extension from Srah to Westport at an estimated cost of £7 million. As the scheme is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme the council's proposal comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next national development plan 2000-06.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises the fact that people who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home may, in some cases, lose out in maintaining <Col N="401" /> their social insurance record. The main difficulties arising in this regard relate to pension entitlements. In order to qualify for contributory pensions people need to maintain a certain yearly average number of contributions over their working lives. Periods spent out of the workforce can therefore, dilute a person's yearly average, resulting in a reduced pension being paid or, in some cases, no pension entitlement.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements are in place (known as homemakers disregards) to help people who work in the home to qualify for the old age (contributory) pension. Years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of 12 or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded.</P>
      <P>Many such people also benefit from a new <i>pro rata</i> pension which was introduced in November 1997 so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age (contributory) pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent. To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Unlike pensions, entitlement to short-term payments, such as disability, maternity and unemployment benefits, is determined by reference to the level of contributions paid in the recent past. Accordingly, a person who has been out of the workforce for a number of years can re-establish entitlement to short-term benefits after a period of time back in the workforce, e.g. nine months in the case of maternity benefit. However problems can arise, in certain cases, in establishing entitlement to short-term benefits so a number of improvements are being implemented in this area. For instance, last December's budget provided for the award of credited contributions to claimants of carer's allowance who have left insurable employment to engage in caring duties. Credited contributions preserve a person's existing social insurance entitlements for the period during which they are awarded, including entitlement to short-term benefits such as maternity benefit.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in recognition of their caring role, the current rule requiring a person to have a record of PRSI contributions within the previous two years in order to qualify for the award of credited contributions is being waived where claimants of carer's allowance have been in receipt of homemakers disregards immediately prior to claiming that allowance. This measure will protect the position of people who did not originally give up work to become carers, but may have qualified for homemakers disregards due to child minding duties and who subsequently became carers. Credited contributions are also awarded during periods of parental leave taken by either parent to care for young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> It is however recognised that more needs to be done, particularly in relation to pension entitlements. The Government's action programme contains a commitment that a mechanism will be provided to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes. My Department is currently in the process of further examining this issue in the context of a general review of the qualifying conditions for old age (contributory) and retirement pensions. It is expected that this review will be completed in mid 1999.</P>
    <P>Following completion of this review, the potential for further improvements will be examined in the light of the recommendations contained in the report of the commission on the family and having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>A green paper on voluntary activity was published in 1997, with a view to initiating a consultation process with the voluntary and community sector leading to publication of a white paper. The purpose of the White Paper is to develop a more cohesive framework of support for the voluntary and community sector and address issues relevant to the relationship between that sector and the statutory sector.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present engaged in a consultation process with the voluntary and community sector and is being assisted by a steering group drawn from the relevant Government Departments and the voluntary and community sector in this regard. The consultation process involves a three phased approach. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The first and second phases of the consultation process have now been completed. In this context, 78 submissions were received by my Department and 56 regional seminars have taken place in different locations around the country. The final phase, which is now being planned, will provide for a national seminar to which people, who have been involved in the initial phases, will be invited to respond to the conclusions arrived at by the steering group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> Both the issue of the difficulty that some voluntary organisations are now experiencing in attracting and keeping volunteers and the issue of the dependence of many voluntary and community groups on community employment have emerged in the consultation process as important issues for the sector which should be addressed in the White Paper. I anticipate that, following completion of the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector, the White Paper will be published before the end of summer 1999.</P>
    <P>The White Paper will contain the Government's response to the range of key issues identified in the consultation process, including the role of community employment and support for volunteering. In the meantime, statutory funding continues to be available from a number of different Government Departments and statutory agencies for different aspects of the work engaged in by voluntary and community organisations. My own Department provides support for community and personal development work undertaken by a wide range of local self-help groups. This support is provided under a number of different schemes. The individual schemes are designed to meet different aspects of the support needs of local groups and are linked to form an overall framework of support and progression path for community and family support groups at different stages of development.</P>
    <P>Schemes of particular relevance to support for staff costs and support for volunteers are the community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; core funded community and family support groups programme; community development education and training grants scheme; scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>Applications under these schemes for assistance with suitable projects are welcome from eligible groups. Details of how to apply are available from the voluntary and community services section in the Department's head office or from the local regional offices. I should point out that funding is not available under these schemes for services that are the responsibility of other statutory agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN international year of older persons is a particularly important milestone in celebrating the contribution that older people have made to society in general. While primary responsibility for the year rests with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, the principles of the UN year, based on independence, participation, care, self-fulfilment and dignity, are fully in accordance with this Government's programme of improvements in the social welfare code for older people.</P>
      <P>One of the principal methods of improving the position of older people is through a strong social welfare pension, based on social insurance. In this regard, this Government is committed to an old age pension rate of £100 per week by 2002. Significant progress has been made towards achieving this objective through a total pension increase of £11 per week in the last two budgets. The Government will continue its work in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another commitment made prior to the 1997 general election was to address the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. I have recently introduced a special new pension for a very specific group of people; namely, self-employed people who were marginally excluded from entitlement to old age (contributory) pensions, as they could not satisfy the condition of having entered social insurance at least ten years before pension age by virtue of the fact that they were over 56 years of age when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988. The new pension will be payable, at 50 per cent of the standard maximum rate, to those people who now have at least five years' reckonable contributions paid since then. It is estimated that up to 8,000 pensioners and their 2,000 qualified adults will benefit from this measure at an estimated full year cost of £18 mill<Col N="405" /> ion. I believe that this approach is both fair and just and am particularly pleased that this additional measure to help our older people has been introduced during the UN international year of older persons.</P>
    <P>This year is an important one in the context of pensions generally. I have often stated my commitment to ensuring that contributory pension coverage is as widely available as possible. The Department is undertaking a detailed review of the contribution conditions applying to the old age (contributory) and retirement pensions. In addition, work on progressing the recommendations of the pensions board, as outlined in its report on the national pensions policy initiative, continues and I hope to publish a pensions Bill later this year or early in 2000.</P>
    <P>In Budget '99, I demonstrated our commitment to improving the position of carers by announcing an £18 million package of improvements. I published a review of the carer's allowance last autumn and many of the recommendations contained in the review have already been addressed and are being progressed. Over 11,500 existing carers will benefit from the measures I have introduced while an additional 3,300 new carers will now qualify for a carer's allowance. This budget package, costing over £18 million, represents a 40 per cent increase on existing expenditure and is a very considerable addition to the £45 million spent on carers in 1998.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month, I hosted, in conjunction with the European Commission, a conference on caring for older people at home &ndash; a strategy for social inclusion. Its theme was both timely and appropriate in this, the UN international year of older people. The conference provided an opportunity for cross-community exchanges on current policies and practices to determine those which best suited supporting older people in remaining active in their own homes and communities.</P>
    <P>The measures and initiatives introduced to date clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to older people and the appreciation we must all have for their continuing, valuable role in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system assists families with death and funeral expenses in a number of ways. These include continuation of social welfare payments for six weeks following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouses, the payment of a bereavement <Col N="406" /> grant to insured people and their families to assist with funeral expenses and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>Following the death of a recipient of a social welfare payment or his-her spouse, payment is generally continued at the same rate for six weeks where both spouses had a separate entitlement (provided one or both of the entitlements was an old age (non-contributory) pension, a blind pension or a carer's allowance) or where the payment includes an increase for a qualified adult. This is to ease the immediate loss of income that would otherwise arise and also to facilitate an examination of the surviving partner's entitlement to, say, the widow(er)'s pension.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy points out, continuation of payment does not arise where each spouse had an independent entitlement to an insurance-based contributory pension. It is estimated that an extension of payment in this way would cost £1 million per annum and would have to be considered in a budgetary context. I can assure the Deputy that the Department will be reviewing the operation and scope of this payment later this year.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and they must satisfy a specified means test. A qualified child is one who falls into one of the age groups specified for the scheme and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of widows and widowers contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple. Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to <Col N="407" /> 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. The only documentation sought is a birth certificate for proof of age and proof that a child dependant allowance is payment in respect of the child.</P>
    <P>The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from 1 June each year. My Department will request the boards to ensure that the majority of payments are made by the 31 July 1999 to enable parents to make the necessary purchases in the traditional back to school shopping month of August. Based on the experience of health board staff this represents the optimum time for payment of this allowance.</P>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme will be reviewed during the course of 1999 as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations. The review will take into account the conclusions reached by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in his value for money examination of the administration of the scheme in 1998. Any changes recommended in the review of the scheme will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April, regardless of the temperature. As a consequence, there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably low and equally, the allowance is paid at times when temperatures are not low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The cost of extending the fuel season is estimated at £2 million per week. Any increase in the payment rate or extension of the fuel season would have to be considered in a budgetary context. However, improvements in the rate payable cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments ranging between £3 or £6 per week effective from June 1999 were announced in the 1999 budget.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of the year. This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme. Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is also provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. An application for a heating supplement or an ENP may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently within my Department there are 152 buildings which are open to the public. One hundred of these are accessible to people with disabilities. These buildings include local offices, investigators' offices and headquarters buildings which have a public office.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in improving and upgrading the general standard and access facilities of my Department's offices. This process of upgrading will continue and will include particular emphasis on improving access for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This upgrading is being systematically undertaken, within the constraints of available technical and financial resources, as part of my Department's building and refurbishment programme. <Col N="410" /> In addition, where refurbishment is neither practical nor appropriate, my Department avails of opportunities, as they arise, to provide accommodation at alternative locations. By the end of 1999, it is envisaged that a further eight buildings will be accessible to people with disabilities. All office upgrades and refurbishment are undertaken in conjunction with the Office of Public Works which ensures compliance with standards regarding access. Where offices are inaccessible to people with disabilities, arrangements can be made to visit such people in their homes.</P>
    <P>There are also 71 branch offices of my Department which are operated by branch managers who are employed on a contract basis. Under the terms of the contract they are required to provide suitable accommodation. A recent survey of branch offices revealed that over half did not satisfy the criteria in relation to accessibility for people with disabilities. However, my Department has recently concluded an agreement with the branch managers in relation to their future role and their remuneration. Included in this agreement is the requirement that specific criteria be met in terms of the standard of accommodation provided by the branch manager and in this regard they will be required to make the premises accessible to people with disabilities, within a reasonable period.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 263 agus 265 le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kilmacurragh was the home of the Acton family for almost three centuries. I understand that in 1934, the Acton family leased the estate with an option to buy to a German hotelier, Mr. Charles Budina, who ran a hotel there. With the outbreak of war Mr. Budina returned to Germany. Subsequently ownership fell into dispute for a long number of years and the estate was eventually purchased in 1974 by the Land Commission. Under the management of the Forest and Wildlife Service and subsequently under Coillte, who established a research station there, the arboretum was put in order again. In 1992, Coillte decided to put some 52 acres, including <Col N="412" /> the house and arboretum, on the market and it was bought by a Mr. and Mrs. William Dolan. The arboretum, including the house, was purchased by my Department in 1996 for £250,000.</P>
    <P>The existence of the Kilmacurragh House Arboretum, with its mature plant collection and its long association with the National Botanic Gardens, another major heritage property in the care of my Department, was the main reason for the purchase of the property by the State. A condition of the purchase was that the house be retained as a ruin. The objective is to stabilise the shell of the house and retain it as a feature of the arboretum, thereby maintaining the relationship of the house and gardens in context for the benefit of all. Essential visitor and staff facilities are being provided this year and my Department is pursuing the question of stabilisation works to preserve the shell of the house.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a building on the register of buildings at risk is a matter for the heritage council, which is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the number of buildings on the building at risk register; if a survey has taken place of all important buildings constructed pre-1900 and in State ownership; the measures, if any, she will employ to bring greater protection of important buildings which are at risk; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11590/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The register of buildings at risk is compiled by the heritage council, which is an independent statutory body under my aegis. I understand that, to date, some 280 buildings have been listed on this register.</P>
      <P>Last May, a package of new measures for the protection of the architectural heritage, including the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings to be operated by local authorities, was announced jointly by me and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The legislative measures included in that package consisted of a new Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, which will provide comprehensive protection of buildings and structures of architectural heritage importance, and a Bill to place the national inventory of architectural heritage (NIAH) on a statutory basis. I am currently steering the latter Bill through the Oireachtas. In addition, the interdepartmental working group on architectural policy set up a task force to report on policy for historic buildings in public authority ownership and this task force is due to complete its work shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NIAH, which operates as part of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is a key component of the overall framework for the protection of the architectural heritage, given that identification and recording of that heritage is an <Col N="413" /> essential prerequisite for protection. At present, surveys of the architectural heritage of the State are being carried out systematically by the NIAH. Prior to my assuming office, no architectural surveys had been published by the NIAH. Since then, Dúchas has published ten town surveys and issued a further 17 in draft form. Those surveys deal with all aspects of the architectural heritage and identify the important structures, whether State or privately owned. The main target for the next three years will be to complete interim county surveys of the 26 counties to assist planning authorities in the identification and protection of the architectural heritage in their functional areas. I consider that this approach is the best use of our resources. Given those priorities, there are no immediate plans to carry out a survey of pre-1900 State owned buildings.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the Royal Canal was transferred to my Department in 1996.</P>
      <P>The replacement of the footbridge in question is, however, a matter for Iarnród Éireann and its engineers and those of my Department have agreed that the appropriate site for the new bridge would be some 30 metres west of the original location. My Department is not aware that Kildare County Council has yet been consulted regarding any necessary planning permission. My Department has co-operated fully with Iarnród Éireann in this matter and I am satisfied that the replacement of the footbridge has not been obstructed or delayed by my Department.</P>

      <P>In relation to flooding in this area, I should point out that the old mill is not under the control of my Department and it is not possible, therefore, to close off the water supply to it.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that my Department has co-operated with the occupants in making the house reasonably comfortable for the present and, as renovation of the house would not prevent the possibility of future flooding, my Department has no plans in this regard.

Under this scheme payment of compensation will be made primarily on the basis of an affadavit sworn by the land/turbary owner or the person claiming traditional rights to turfcutting. Compensation will be based on actual loss of income as vouched or evidenced, as opposed to notional loss of income. Where agreement cannot be reached on the amount of compensation payable, the matter may be referred to arbitration by either party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 276 together.</P>
      <P>The overall average annual cost of keeping an offender in custody is £51,500. A breakdown between institutions is not yet available. This figure is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders over a certain period, in this case the year 1998. The equivalent figure for the year to date in 1999 is not available as the costs taken into account include items which are not paid from the prisons Vote, such as teachers' salaries and superannuation, and these are not yet known. However, the expenditure to end March on the current running costs under the prisons Vote was £31,304,000 and the daily average number in custody to date is 2,728. This would indicate that the average cost is decreasing this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These running costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the level of prisoners in custody i.e. mainly officers' wages but also such items as lighting and heating. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that each increase by one in the prison population will result in increased expenditure of £51,500 per annum. Taking the fixed costs into account, the additional expenditure would be more in the region of £17,740. Neither, due to economies of scale, would there be a direct <i>pro rata</i> relationship with changes in <Col N="417" /> the number of prisoners in other areas of expenditure such as overtime, education, work and training. In fact, the only area which would see such a relationship is the prisoners' gratuities subhead, expenditure on which is linked directly to the number of sentenced prisoners in custody.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí have received 179 complaints about speeding in residential areas in the Dublin metropolitan area for the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999. In response to these complaints and, where speeding offences have been detected, the gardaí have taken the following measures: increased garda patrols, increased speed checks, issue of fines on the spot for speeding; roving checkpoints, high visibility checkpoints.</P>
      <P>In addition, in co-operation with the relevant local authorities, the following traffic calming measures, designed to control speed and volume, have been implemented by local authorities in the Dublin area where appropriate: rumble strips, traffic ramps, weight restriction signs, changing of traffic signal sequence, provision of extra road signs.</P>
      <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that in the Dublin Metropolitan Area a total number of 21,438 fines on the spot for speeding were issued and there were 1,583 prosecutions for speeding offences for the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999.</P>

      <P>Moneys arising from interlocutory orders, obtained by the Criminal Assets Bureau under section 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, are placed in appropriate bank accounts to await the making of disposal orders. A disposal order may be made by the High Court only after an interlocutory order has been in place for a period of not less than seven years. Consequently, no sum has been deposited with the Minister for Finance to be realised for the benefit of the Exchequer or with any such person as the High Court may determine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The expert group on the probation and welfare service in its first report, published on 2 November 1998 made a number of recommendations as follows: an increase in staff numbers and that recruitment be streamlined; that the service needs to develop a PR strategy; an up-to-date IT system must be installed; a staff training analysis be carried out; comprehensive research facilities should be available within the service; and insurance cover regulations for community service projects be changed.</P>
      <P>In relation to staffing matters, there are 19.5 vacancies at present in the basic grade of permanent probation and welfare officer, 11 of which were filled by appointing temporary unestablished probation and welfare officers on a contract basis. The Civil Service Commission is currently recruiting staff to enable these posts to be filled in mid-1999. As regards the additional 65 probation and welfare officers and the ten other senior staff and clerical support staff recommended in the expert group's report, I am currently negotiating with the Department of Finance on this issue. The group is continuing its work and I am expecting the group's second report in June.</P>
      <P>In relation to providing a comprehensive public information and awareness programme my Department will be looking at how best a public relations initiative can be progressed to promote knowledge about the current and future development for the service.</P>
      <P>As regards an IT package for the service, it has been possible to make progress by putting in place local area networks in the probation and welfare offices. These have been installed and a considerable amount of computer hardware has been purchased. I am hopeful that by the end of 1999 there will be a comprehensive information technology system in place. In consultation with the probation and welfare service, my Department will be implementing a comprehensive training programme for the new IT system and will take into account additional training needs as they arise. The probation and welfare service has a small research unit and when the extra staff and the improved IT system are in place this will allow for the development of more detailed statistics and data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards community service projects and related insurance issues, I am examining this whole area with a view to providing easier and <Col N="421" /> more cost effective insurance cover for people doing community service work.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to inform the Deputy that I am fully committed to the development of community sanctions and measures as one means among others of combating crime. The probation and welfare service has a significant role to play in this regard.</P>

      <P>As I have outlined to the House on numerous occasions there has been a number of measures put in place to deal with the problem of violence against women. The national steering committee on violence against women which was established in December 1997 is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with responsibility for the development of a cohesive, multi agency and multi-disciplinary response to the issue of violence towards women, including rape and sexual assault. The committee issued its first report on 7 March 1999 and this outlined the various initiatives undertaken in this area since the task force on violence against women reported in April 1997.</P>
      <P>The committee has also developed an awareness campaign aimed at generating a wider public debate on the subject of violence against women, in all its forms in a range of media which would reach all strata of society. The campaign will be further developed over the coming months and will aim to highlight to the victims that help is available, to the perpetrators that violence is a crime and that it must stop and to the public generally that they should not condone violence of any description.</P>
      <P>The committee is currently examining the development of a single national crisis helpline in order to facilitate easier access to services and information.</P>
      <P>The law on barring orders was the subject of a comprehensive review which led to enactment of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. That Act updated and re-enacted with substantial amendments the law contained in legislation of 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing legislation would seem to provide for the circumstances referred to by the Deputy. However, operation of the law in relation to domestic violence continues to be reviewed by my Department in consultation with, among others, the national steering committee on violence against women. Where any further changes in the law are found to be warranted and feasible, I shall <Col N="423" /> include them in the context of the proposed family law Bill that is referred to in the Government's legislation programme.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement regarding age is under the Employment Equality Act 1998, which was enacted in June, 1998, and the Equal Status Bill, 1999, which was published on 19 April 1999. The Employment Equality Act, 1998 outlaws discrimination in employment on nine grounds, including age. The aim is to bring this Act into operation in September 1999. The equal status legislation will outlaw discrimination in non-employment areas on the same nine grounds.</P>
      <P>There are no new or existing schemes in my Department to celebrate the UN year of the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have examined the newspaper article in question. When I entered Government, there was a major backlog of applications due to the surge in the number of asylum seekers which had been experienced in 1996 and in the first half of 1997. Since coming into Government, I have taken a number of steps to deal with the influx of asylum seekers. I have obtained Government approval to recruit an additional 144 staff to assist in processing applications for refugee status and for other asylum related work.</P>
      <P>In addition, a one-stop-shop for asylum seekers has been set up in Timberlay House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2. The premises houses officials processing asylum applications, the independent appeals authorities, the Eastern Health Board's refugee and medical screening units, the refugee legal service and a research and documentation centre. The refugee legal service which commenced on 22 February 1999 is an independent, comprehensive legal service to assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure including representation of asylum seekers at appeal hearings.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that by the end of 1998, all applicants who had sought asylum in this State before January 1997 had been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview. First stage determination of asylum applications follows within a matter of weeks of the substantive interview in most cases, exceptions would be where a re-interview or further detailed inquiries are necessary.</P>
      <P>By June 1999 it is expected that all applicants who lodged a claim up to March 1998 will have been afforded the opportunity of a substantive &ndash; interview. Simultaneously the task force put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with a mixture of new and old applications. At the present rates of progress and based on current application figures it is expected that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date will be dealing with applications on a current basis.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the right to work for asylum seekers is currently under consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>I have set 1 September 1999 as the target date for implementation of the Employment Equality Act, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act outlaws discrimination on nine distinct grounds. The grounds are &ndash; gender, marital <Col N="425" /> status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. The scope of the Act is comprehensive and deals with discrimination in work related areas, from vocational training to access to employment and employment conditions generally, including training, work experience and advancement within employment.</P>
    <P>As well as outlawing discrimination in employment, the Act makes provision for a new infrastructure to underpin the statutory rights being provided under both employment equality and equal status legislation. The new infrastructure will consist of the equality authority, to replace the existing employment equality agency, and the office of director of equality investigations to provide redress of first instance.</P>
    <P>Work is ongoing to secure staff and other resources to establish the new organisations including the agreement by the Office of Public Works of the terms of a lease for a property in Clonmel Street, off Harcourt Street. I appointed the equality authority on a designate basis on 8 March in order that it can also undertake the necessary preparations for implementation day.</P>

      <P>Crime statistics in respect of the past 12 months have not yet been published. Provisional statistics for the 12 months ending 31 March 1999 are shown in the table below. I should emphasise that these figures are subject to change as Garda investigations progress.</P>
      <P>I understand that by serious crime, the Deputy is referring in particular to the offences of rape, murder and armed robbery, and I shall accordingly limit my comments to these crimes.</P>
      <P>In the case of murder, the statistics show no change over the period shown, with 39 offences recorded in both 12 month periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> Regrettably, the number of rapes reported to the gardaí continues to rise, although the rate of increase has slowed down dramatically. I recently welcomed the Garda Commissioner's announcement that he is taking all the necessary steps to identify the reasons for this increase and to put in place measures to tackle this vicious crime. I also expect to publish legislation during the sum<Col N="430" /> mer which will give added protection to victims of rape who have to face the further ordeal of court when the attacker is brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Finally, the statistics for the last 12 months show a 4 per cent rise in the offence of robbery with firearms. A glance at the very small numbers involved, however, will show that this apparent rise may be less significant than it at first appears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department carries central responsibility for many areas of public policy and administration including law enforcement, the treatment of offenders, the administration of the courts, immigration and asylum issues as well as the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equality of treatment for disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>As well as the foregoing, there is a range of other responsibilities exercised under the aegis of my Department by agencies operating on either a statutory or administrative basis. The principal examples are the Probation and Welfare Service, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Legal Aid Board and the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, the Deputy will appreciate, I am sure, that there are, quite literally, hundreds of buildings, courts, Garda stations, offices and institutions which are open to the public and in daily use by my Department. In the short time available to answer parliamentary questions, it is not possible to be specific about each and every one.</P>
      <P>However, very many of these are already easily accessible to people with disabilities, and I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department's customer service action plan clearly commits the Department to ensuring that the appropriate provision is made in all existing buildings where possible, and that all new and refurbished buildings being provided will be designed to include such provision.</P>

As the Deputy is aware a report on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta was submitted to the Minister for Public Enterprise in mid April. I understand the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke is studying the contents of the report and is taking appropriate advice, and that she will be making recommendations to Government on the range of options for Aer Rianta including the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to speculate or comment on the matter.</P>

      <P>School management authorities are responsible for the prevention of bullying behaviour in schools and for putting in place procedures for dealing with incidences of bullying behaviour. My Department has issued guidelines to all schools to assist them in discharging their responsibilities in this regard. The guidelines are intended to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management, staff, pupils and parents. Schools are advised that the anti-bullying code should be included as part of the school plan/policy statement and should be available to all.</P>

Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met. This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides some latitude in relation to providing additional time where necessary to the pool of examiners available for junior certificate marking. Ultimately the time required for the proper execution of the marking process is a direct function of the number of available examiners and the number of scripts to be examined.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that priority must be given to the issue of the leaving certificate results so as to ensure that the CAO college entry process executes in a timely manner.</P>

      <P>The amount of homework assigned by teachers at primary level varies with the age of the child and, at second level, with the level and number of subjects being followed by pupils. It is becoming standard practice for schools to develop a homework policy as part of their school development planning process. This is frequently done in consultation with parents.</P>
      <P>Schools are aware of the need to plan, co-ordinate and supervise the allocation of homework to pupils and therefore it is not proposed to issue a circular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Schools are not required to advise my Department of cases where children are suspended or otherwise excluded from schools. My <Col N="437" /> Department, however, through its guidelines on school discipline, lays considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Under the Rules for National Schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through the Inspectorate to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school, or alternatively, his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner. I should add that I am not satisfied with the adequacy of current arrangements in relation to school attendance, suspension and expulsion.</P>
      <P>Under the Education Welfare Bill, which was published last week, I will be bringing forward a comprehensive range of measures in relation to children with educational welfare problems. The Bill provides a framework within which issues relating to the educational welfare of children, including the causes and effects of school attendance problems, can be addressed effectively. Among its key objectives is the establishment of a national education welfare board to co-ordinate and implement services for children in difficulty within the school system. The legislation will also include specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
      <P>In addition, the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative will involve the development of a tracking template/pupil data-base for use in primary and second level schools which will track children's attendance and ensure that corrective action can be taken at an early stage.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the need to put in place appropriate security arrangements to ensure that the national educational Internet website Scoilnet is as safe as possible for children to access. Tracking of Internet activity is possible through the use of filtering software on computer equipment supplied to schools as part of the schools IT2000 initiative. Schools have been advised to use such software on computer equipment while accessing the Internet. Various other security methods are being investigated by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, in consultation with my Department.</P>
      <P>The NCTE has recently prepared a comprehensive booklet containing guidelines for primary schools and parents on the safe and appropriate use of the Internet. This booklet will be issued shortly to schools, to chairpersons of boards of management and to all affiliated branches of the National Parents Council Primary. Included within the guidelines is a code of conduct on Internet usage as recommended in the first report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet published in 1998 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the NCTE and my Department are in discussions with various Internet service providers on the issue of ensuring safety and security for children in the use of the Internet as an educational tool. These discussions are focused on the provision of filtering software at both the user end and the Internet service provider end.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 to 334, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Overall, between Youthreach in FÁS and the vocational education committees and the network of senior traveller training centres which caters for traveller early school leavers, it is envisaged that 7,162 participants will be catered for in the foundation and progression phases of the programmes. The drop out rate without completing the programme, based on 1997 trends, is expected to be of the order of 24 per cent.</P>
      <P>The delivery of Youthreach is overseen by an interdepartmental committee on early school leaving which includes representation from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS. National co-ordinators for the programme are in place in FÁS and the education sector is to monitor and report on the delivery of the programme, to organise staff development, to advise on good practice, and to liaise with various interests. Through these structures close contact is maintained with the national youthstart support structure, the National Youth Council, the National Youth Federation, and area development management. The policy unit responsible within my Department is the further education section.</P>
      <P>Youthreach is one of the programmes aided by the European Social Fund as part of the operational programme for human resources development 1994-99, and as such is one of the programmes reported on formally on a twice yearly basis to the EU human resources monitoring committee which includes representatives of the European Commission, ICTU, IBEC, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the National Youth Council, the community workers co-op and the ESF and CSF evaluation units.</P>
      <P>The programme has been evaluated by the European Social Fund evaluation unit in 1996, and has also featured extensively in the report of the National Economic and Social Forum on youth unemployment and early school leaving, in the mid-term review of the human resources operational programme, and in evaluations of the community support framework by the ESRI. In addition, a thematic evaluation of progression is currently under way by the ESF evaluation unit.</P>
      <P>The ESRI have pointed to the marked difference between Youthreach participants views of the programme and their prior experience of schooling. For those who leave school early with no qualifications, Youthreach represents a new opportunity to succeed in a learning environment, a gradual return of self-esteem and the means to progress to further education or employment. A progression rate of 70 per cent to further education and employment is a clear indication that the programme is working successfully.</P>

      <Quest>if dyslexic students will not have any marks deducted for misspellings in any subject in the junior and leaving certificate examinations in view of the fact many dyslexics are unable to spell correctly but in other ways are equally competent.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examination for students, who have either specific learning difficulties or difficulties which arise from a physical or medical condition, is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability, while at the same time not conferring an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving and junior certificate examinations are national examinations and I am sure the <Col N="444" /> Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the national examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done.</P>
    <P>Generally the marking schemes do not involve any deduction of marks for spelling errors. However, in some language subjects where such skills are under assessment and where the certification implies that the candidate has those skills, it would be inappropriate to set aside the national marking scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in Irish as in all living languages there is a constant process of growth. New words are composed and gain recognition in Gaeltacht areas where Irish is the vernacular long before they find their way into dictionaries or textbooks. Sometimes words are composed by writers and journalists, based on their own linguistic skills, in response to their own needs.</P>
      <P>There is no central record of such words; therefore I am confining myself to the Irish words, or terms, introduced by the one relevant body which comes within my remit as Minister and is based within my Department, that is an coiste téarmaíochta.</P>
      <P>The numbers of new terms, which sometimes are combinations of words already in the language, introduced during the last five years by an coiste téarmaíochta are as follows: 1994: 1163, 1995: 1143, 1996, 1495, 1997: 1421, 1998: 1932.</P>
