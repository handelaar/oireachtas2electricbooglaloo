      <Quest>cén plean atá ag an strategic management initiative seirbhís a chur ar fáil do Theachtaí Dála, do státseirbhísigh agus don phobal i gcoitinne as Gaeilge nuair nach bhfuil tagairt ar bith do ghné seo an SMI sa nuachtlitir Link is déanaí, Samhain 1999.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the strategic management initiative is the delivery of an excellent service to all citizens. The provision of a bilingual service to members of the public has been identified as an important aspect of the SMI's quality customer service initiative, which was launched in 1997. The principles of quality customer service state that services should be made available for those who wish to do business in Irish. In addition, the SMI division issued guidelines to Departments and offices in July 1998 concerning the use of Irish in publications for the public. These guidelines were based on Bord na Gaeilge's &ldquo;Expanding Bilingualism &ndash; Guidelines for Action Programmes in the State Sector&rdquo;. One of these guidelines is that at least a reasonable amount of Irish should be used in material for the public. The SMI produced four reports in 1999, three of which contained an introduction or executive summary in Irish.</P>
      <P>Quality customer service was also a key aspect of the next phase of the SMI, which was launched in Dublin Castle in July this year. Speaking at that launch, I stated that the new working group, which has been established to chart a course for the next stage of QCS, should pay particular attention to the needs of specific groups of customers, including users of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Link</i>, the newsletter of the SMI, is issued free of charge to all civil servants, Deputies, Senators and public service bodies. Although the July 1999 edition of <i>Link</i> invited contributions in Irish, none was received. However, in line with the guidelines referred to above, every effort will be <Col N="1230" /> made to ensure that Irish is used in future editions.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Taoiseach as an bhfreagra. An leor prionsobail agus treoirlínte chun seirbhís Ghaeilge agus Béarla a chur ar fáil, mar ní hionann dátheangachas agus píosa réasúnta, mar a dúirt sé sa bhfreagra &ndash; a reasonable piece, nó réamhrá a bheith as Gaeilge? Would it be satisfactory to have píosa reasúnta and a réamhrá in English with the rest in Irish for English speakers? Is it satisfactory to have a reasonable piece and an introduction in Irish to satisfy the needs of bilingualism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The editors of <i>Link</i> magazine wish to make sure that they cover the provisions for bilingual services and they believe that this is part of the quality service initiative, in which they are involved. I have received copies of three of their four publications to date and there has been an amount of Irish in them. They would like to have a substantial amount of Irish in each publication but what happened with the last edition, which prompted the Deputy's question, is that they asked for contributions and did not receive any. They would like to achieve a bilingual service, which would provide articles in both Irish and English in every edition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá fhios agam nach bhfuil aon Gaeilge san eagrán <i>Link</i> a fuair mé ach tá go leor daoine ag éirí as an Státseirbhís a bhfuil Gaeilge acu..Many Irish speakers are retiring. An bhfuil nó an mbeidh plean ag an Rialtas daoine le Gaeilge a cheapadh nó an tré thimpist a thagann daoine le Gaeilge isteach sa Státseirbhís? Níor chuir mé ceist ar cad a cheapann an SMI; chuir me ceist ar cad a cheapann an Taoiseach faoin dátheangachas. Is ceannaire é an Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is that a sufficient amount of Irish is given to them to publish. I would like to see the magazine publish sufficient Irish articles or inputs from whatever source along with the English articles. Many fluent Irish speakers and people with a good knowledge of Irish are leaving the Civil Service. The <i>Link </i>magazine should reflect both languages. It is not policy to ignore or curtail the amount of Irish in the magazines. That was evident in three of the quarterly editions which were published this year. There was a substantive amount of Irish articles in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní bhfuair mé freagra ar an gceist a chuir mé. I do not know whether the Taoiseach's headphones are working. Is there a plan to recruit people who have Irish into the Civil Service? Is it an accident that people come into the Civil Service with a knowledge of Irish? This is an important point for the future. Is there any plan to replace individuals with fluent Irish who are retiring with people who also have fluent Irish?</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a plan. While there has been some discussion about the system which gives an advantage to Irish speakers, it has served the Civil Service well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is doing away with that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case, but I would not agree with its achievements being done away with. It successfully brought in Irish speakers from Gaeltacht areas and Irish schools in non-Gaeltacht areas. I hope this ethos will not be lost. All Departments are anxious that the Civil Service Commission continues to recruit as many people as possible who can competently deal with individuals who wish to do their business through Irish. This is the policy of Departments.</P>

      <P>One of the North-South bodies is concerned with Ulster Scots. Is there any plan to disseminate knowledge of that language on this side of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware until recently that there is a group in this city which continues the tradition of Ulster Scots. I have asked for some details about the group. The language committee is divided into two sections, one which will deal with the Irish language and the other with Ulster Scots. It will have to ensure that it can handle those issues and we are committed to ensuring that matter will be on the agenda. I do not know much about the group which has followed the language for generations in this city but I intend to follow up the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 16, inclusive, and 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The first plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council took place in Armagh yesterday. In line with the provisions of the relevant agreements, I led the Government delegation from this jurisdiction. The Northern Ireland Executive Committee delegation was led by Mr. David Trimble, First Minister, and Mr. Séamus Mallon, Deputy First Minister, who acted as joint chairmen for the meeting.</P>
      <P>At the meeting both sides acknowledged the importance of the occasion as a significant further step in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We welcomed the role that the council could play in developing consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland, including through implementation on an all-island and cross-Border basis, of matters of mutual interest within the competence of the administrations, North and South. We agreed that there is real potential for mutual benefit in many sectors and we looked forward to realising that potential in the council in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>We also agreed, recalling the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships between North and South, that the council should play a central role in promoting reconciliation within, and ensuring a better future for all the people on, the island.</P>
      <P>At the meeting we agreed a memorandum of procedure which sets out the procedural arrangements relating to the proceedings and operation of the council. The council, taking account of considerations of North-South balance and regional dispersion, as well as objective factors relating to the various individual bodies, also agreed on the locations of the headquarters and other offices of the six implementation bodies and of the tourism company, when established. The council also made appointments of members of the management boards of the Trade and Business Development Body, the North-South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and the advisory board to the Food Safety Body.</P>
      <P>The council also agreed an outline programme of work in regard to the areas of co-operation as a basis for follow-up in the appropriate sectoral formats and that the relevant proposals in the outline programme of work should be tabled at the first meetings of the council in each appropriate sectoral format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the council considered its approach to future work arrangements, programmes and meetings. It agreed that the council would meet in sectoral format to consider issues relating to the implementation bodies &ndash; Waterways Ireland, <Col N="1234" /> Food Safety Promotion Board, Special EU Programmes, North-South Language Body, Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and the Trade and Business Development Body &ndash;  and matters for co-operation, which are transport, agriculture, education, health, environment and tourism. In view of the urgent need to take forward certain matters in relation to the implementation bodies and areas for co-operation, the council agreed that particular priority be given to meetings of the council relevant to those issues and that these would take place at the earliest possible date. It agreed also that the question of additional sectoral formats will be agreed by the council in institutional format.</P>
    <P>The council noted that the meeting was taking place at the start of a week which would see further significant developments, with inaugural summit meetings of the British Irish Council and the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference scheduled to take place in London on Friday, 17 December.  Again, in line with the provisions of the relevant agreements, I will lead the Irish Government delegation.</P>
    <P>Strand three of the Good Friday Agreement provides that &ldquo;the British-Irish Council will meet in different formats: at summit level, twice per year; and in specific formats on a regular basis, with each side represented by the appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  However, the Agreement also provides that &ldquo;the elected institutions of the members will be encouraged to develop interparliamentary links, perhaps building on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now that the Agreement has entered into force, steps will be taken to follow-up on the parliamentary aspect. This will require consultation with and within the two Houses of the Oireachtas. It will be necessary to take account of the existence of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which has already considered its future in light of the Agreement and which will need to be consulted further.</P>
    <P>My Department has played a key role, with the other Departments involved, including through intensive contact with No. 10 Downing Street in supporting and assisting the efforts by Senator George Mitchell, in his review, to overcome the difficulties which had prevented the implementation of the institutional aspects of the Agreement. The outcome of those efforts has been apparent over the past three weeks and has led to the British-Irish Agreement entering into force and to the implementation last week of the institutional and constitutional aspects of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department played a major role in the implementation of the North-South aspects of the Agreement, including the negotiation of the areas for implementation bodies and for co-operation through existing bodies in each jurisdiction, the negotiation of the supplementary international agreements on the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Con<Col N="1235" /> ference and especially the implementation bodies, in the preparation and enactment of the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999 and the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act, 1999, in the settlement of the procedure for the North-South Ministerial Council and in preparation for such practical matters as the joint designation by the Irish and British Governments of persons to carry out on an interim basis the functions of chief executives of the implementation bodies, pending the appointment of actual chief executives &ndash; which has been done &ndash; the nomination of persons to be directors of those implementation bodies that will have them and the settlement of the negotiating position of the Irish Government on the locations of the head-quarters and other locations of the bodies.</P>
    <P>All these matters were taken forward vigorously with a view to the establishment of the implementation bodies, which occurred on Thursday, 2 December and to enabling them to be operational as soon as possible. This involved a large amount of co-ordination with all other Departments involved, including on such matters as financial memoranda and staffing principles for the bodies.</P>
    <P>My Department has also played a substantial role in advancing follow-up in regard to the six agreed areas for co-operation, where implementation is to be by existing bodies in the two jurisdictions, so as to enable a solid follow-up on these matters in the initial meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council in various sectoral formats. My Department has also had a significant input in regard to implementation of other areas of the Agreement as they apply to this jurisdiction, including, for example, human rights aspects, matters relating to the victims of violence and the promotion of reconciliation, but other Departments are primarily responsible for these areas.</P>
    <P>For the future, my Department will continue to play an active role in the further implementation of the Agreement, in all the areas that I have already identified including in providing the necessary support for me in my participation in the meetings of the plenary format of the North-South Ministerial Council, which are to take place twice a year.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the need for the effective implementation of the cross-Border and all-island elements of the Good Friday Agreement. The implementation of the arrangements approved yesterday will represent important steps in that process. The Government will act as necessary to ensure that the mutual benefits are, and are seen to be, realised.  All of our efforts have focused on bringing a better future to all of this island, including the Border counties and we will continue to work to achieve that.</P>
    <P>In answering the question as to the role of my Department, I should, however, underline that all the progress that has been made in implementing the Good Friday Agreement has been the result of a very committed collective effort by all Mini<Col N="1236" /> sters and Departments involved, to whom I pay tribute.</P>
    <P>Further to the provision under the section of the Good Friday Agreement relating to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, which states that the Irish Government will &ldquo;continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland&rdquo;, the Irish Government has paid £150,000 for the Irish Peace Park in Messines, and has committed a further allocation of £50,000. Some £24,000 has been allocated to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers Association towards the costs of developing a multimedia presentation aimed at highlighting the sacrifices made by all traditions on this island in World War I. Funding has also been allocated to the Cork Lions Club towards the costs of restoring the Cenotaph on South Mall in Cork city and to the Ulster Society, towards the costs of their ongoing activities aimed at promoting Ulster-British heritage and culture. A grant is also being made to the Ulster Historical Foundation towards the costs of its project entitled &ldquo;History of the Irish Parliament&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was glad to announce, last Sunday week, that the Government has agreed in principle to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne. A special interdepartmental committee, established by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, has been given the task of bringing forward comprehensive long-term proposals for the development of the site. We are spending £150,000 on immediate interim measures to improve public access, visitor facilities and information material.</P>
    <P>In opening up this hugely important part of our shared heritage to the people of this island and to overseas visitors, the Government will continue to consult closely with representatives of the Unionist tradition, with the relevant local authorities and with community groups.</P>
    <P>I have been in regular contact with the office holders and parties in Northern Ireland and with other relevant Government leaders in recent days and weeks. On the subject of a meeting with President Clinton, there are no plans for such a meeting in the near future. However, I met the President at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul a few weeks ago.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is disappointment in some Border counties that, for example, there is no major office of a cross-Border institution being established in County Monaghan or County Cavan, counties which have suffered substantially as a result of the existence of the Border and the violence associated with it over the past 60 years? Would he not have considered that towns such as Monaghan, Clones, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross would have been ideal locations for a suitable institution, as would Cavan or Cootehill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been representations from many towns and counties. They are <Col N="1237" /> all suitable but it is just that there is not enough to go around. We weighed the balance in favour of the North regarding the bigger offices &ndash; with Newry, Enniskillen and Omagh being allocated the biggest offices. We forfeited our right in getting equality in this regard because of the significance of some of these areas, particularly Omagh and Enniskillen. There are smaller offices in other locations but as we move on to further implementation bodies and further offices, as we will inevitably do, the understanding is that the balance will swing back to the South.</P>
      <P>Some of the smaller offices are quite small and will not mean any great assistance. Of the eight locations in the South which have been selected as a base for either the headquarters or sub-offices, four of these, Carrick-on-Shannon, Monaghan, the Carlingford Lough area and Donegal are in the Border counties. UCC has the food facility and the food safety promotional area is located in Cork because UCC has been in this business since the days when it was a centre for dairy science. We have tried to spread the offices around, but Cavan is an obvious location for the future for some of the bigger ones. In the circumstances I gave way to allow some of the bigger offices on this occasion to be based in the North.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that no one from Monaghan has been appointed to the bodies and only one person from Cavan has been appointed? I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on that.</P>
      <P>In light of the setting up of the British-Irish ministerial body, will the Ulster Unionists be taking their seats in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body so that there will be comprehensive representation? Furthermore, will arrangements be put in place to ensure closer cross-Border hospital co-operation? There are tremendous possibilities for cross-Border co-operation in the hospital services, in dealing with emergencies and specialisation in particular disciplines in hospitals in the Border areas in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is already some co-operation, health is an excellent area in which to quickly build up contacts and relationships. We have different specialties which are to the forefront of our medical involvement. If a meeting has not taken place already, an early meeting is due under the co-operation heading. There is already contact at the teaching hospital-medical university level and there is an effort to formalise that and make it far more comprehensive. The area of health research was mentioned in some of the side discussions yesterday and there is an opportunity for us to begin exchanging such information. Health research is an expensive business so we can benefit from co-operation in that sector. We are already spending substantial amounts of money on cancer research, while in the North health researchers have been involved in substantive research on the treatment of burns by skin grafts &ndash; an area of which we do not have <Col N="1238" /> as much knowledge. There is an enormous potential for co-operation in all these areas.</P>
      <P>Replying directly to the Deputy's question, the sectoral formats will be discussed at an early meeting. I cannot remember when the meeting on health issues will take place, but all the bodies will hold one meeting before Christmas and health will be an important aspect. I will take account of the points Deputy Bruton made regarding the residency of some of the individuals appointed.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Bruton's support for the lobby for Cavan and Monaghan, and the Taoiseach's response on the future prospects for both counties. Does the Taoiseach agree that the establishment this week of the All-Ireland structures under the Good Friday Agreement marks a milestone in the history of this island and that it has tremendous potential to render partition redundant? Does he also agree that as well as utilising the new structures to the full, there is a need to ensure that the key areas of All-Ireland co-operation, including agriculture, tourism, education, health, the environment and transport, are developed speedily?</P>
      <P>In direct association with the opportunities afforded to the Taoiseach in recent days, will he advise the House if he raised with the British Prime Minister the discovery of a listening and tracking device in a vehicle used by the Sinn Féin president, Mr. Gerry Adams, and the newly appointed Minister for Education, Mr. Martin McGuinness? What response did the Taoiseach receive? Does he regard it as unacceptable that the British Prime Minister maintains a total and self-imposed silence on the issue and on the monitoring by British Intelligence of all telecommunications contact in and out of this island, as was recently revealed? I would welcome the Taoiseach's response to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the North-South ministerial bodies which provide an opportunity for us to develop a range of contacts, not only in the implementation bodies but also in other sectors. I was pleased that members of all parties represented on the Executive, who attended yesterday's meeting &ndash; with one exception &ndash; welcomed the implementation bodies. One of the points that might have been lost in recent days was that the six implementation bodies were agreed before the Good Friday Agreement, they <Col N="1239" /> did not arise from subsequent discussions. The implementation bodies we are now operating were agreed earlier on in Holy Week 1998, before we finalised the Good Friday Agreement which was to continue to expand and develop that list. That is not to mention all the discussions that took place around the area of co-operation and the implementation bodies, which we agreed exactly a year ago, on 17/18 December 1998. As is set out in the memorandum of understanding and the memorandum of operation, there is not just an enormous opportunity to co-operate in exchanging information but also to work on developing areas of action. I have no doubt that potential will be built upon in a spirit of friendship and with much activity from the Irish side. That is what we should do. The early response from members of the Executive who want to become involved in working formats is heartening. Meetings have already been arranged for January.</P>
      <P>I raised the security issues which were mentioned here last week, as promised. The British Government does not publicly, or privately for that matter, make responses to these initiatives. However, I raised the matter and I think the message was received. I will not, of course, state what Prime Minister Blair stated in return because these meetings are confidential. However, I made the point strongly.</P>
      <P>I also made the point, as I said here I would last week, about the normalisation paper and the necessity to move on very quickly with it. Since I made those comments last week, Castlereagh detention centre was closed down, which I hope will start the process of dealing with a number of the normalisation issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, at this very early stage of this new and historic step, references to the cross-Border bodies as being ones which would make partition redundant are misleading, in regard to the contents of the Good Friday Agreement, and capable of arousing unnecessary fears, and that we should tread very carefully in relation to this cross-Border co-operation based, as it is, on the Council of Europe ministerial meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question relates to the very comprehensive initial reply the Taoiseach gave, which will bear some study. On the basis of what he said and the notes I took, can he indicate if there will <Col N="1240" /> be a permanent physical secretariat for the cross-Border bodies? Will it have one central secretariat, similar to the way the Commission services the European Council of Ministers? If so, where will that body be located? Will it publish its calendar or programme of ministerial meetings? Can I take it, if it has a formal physical headquarters, that all the ministerial meetings will take place in one venue as a norm, although with the possibility to go to other places on occasion?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was somewhat vague, although perhaps that was because a decision has not yet been made. There is the British-Irish Council and also the Council of the Isles which, in effect, refer to the same matter, depending from which point one is looking at them. I used the two terms interchangeably in my questions to the Taoiseach. I am referring specifically to the parliamentary tier that would arise from this agreement. Can I take it there is a possibility that the existing British-Irish parliamentary body would continue with a separate existence to a new parliamentary body that would represent elected representatives from the various democratic assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Dublin, London, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands? Or, if the Taoiseach is in a position to answer the question, is it intended at this stage to have one inclusive parliamentary tier, which would mean, in effect, that the British-Irish parliamentary group would be subsumed into a wider grouping?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the spirit of the all-island cross-Border initiatives is not too sensitive, but it must be developed and worked on and people must gain confidence in it. That will take some time. However, having said that, it is immensely important, particularly for people in Border regions, to see it develop. Hopefully, in time, people will just get used to the idea. I think that will happen fairly quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if the view is allowed to emerge the successful operation of cross-Border bodies will, in some way, accelerate the making of partition redundant, that that will, in itself, become an impediment to the presence of people who, sadly, were not at the meeting yesterday? Does he agree that the objective of the agreement is to say that the issues involving sovereignty are dealt with elsewhere in the overall Agreement and that it is not in anybody's interest to send that confusing message?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The principles of consent are elsewhere in the Agreement. I was <Col N="1241" /> extremely careful yesterday to try to strike a balance between the people at the meeting and those who did not attend. Some of the remarks made by people not at the meeting did not reflect the spirit of the parties who attended, and some of the issues they raised were exaggerated. However, I welcome the fact that they were talking about the same issues as the people at the meeting, issues such as co-operation and joint action where appropriate. I look forward to the day when they change their stance and attend the meetings, and I hope that day is not too far away.</P>
      <P>There is a centre and a secretariat and there will be two nominees &ndash; one representing the Executive and one representing the Government. People are still moving offices and arrangements are still being made so I will send a detailed note with all the facts to the party leaders. An official was appointed in recent days to head our administrative staff. The intention is to have one office at one location but negotiations are ongoing. I will send a detailed note. I take the point about having regular meetings and circulating information. It will be complicated just to keep track of the meetings taking place in January so we need to build a system from the start and I will do so.</P>
      <P>At the time of the Good Friday Agreement it was my view that the British-Irish parliamentary body, in its present form, would fold and become a parliamentary tier comprising representatives from Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and our friends from the Northern Ireland Assembly. Strong views have been expressed on this issue by parliamentary colleagues in this House and Westminster.</P>

At the start of negotiations, I attended the proceedings of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body in County Cavan for a day. The spirit of the meeting was that I should endeavour to bring all the parliamentary groups, assemblies or otherwise, together. Having succeeded in that, I admit there is validity in the point made about the difference between the sovereignty and regional assemblies. That point has also been made in Westminster.

I hope normality will be restored so these more extreme security actions will not be necessary. The British Government would like to reach that position as soon as it can. It must listen to its security staff, which is the way all Governments operate. We do the same &ndash; the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must listen to security reports. I will not criticise the British Prime Minister because he listens to his security staff, as I do the same.</P>

      <P>In view of the importance and value of co-operation on the cross-Border bodies to both sides of the Border, will the Taoiseach consider giving a Minister responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of these bodies? Will he pay attention to the point made by Deputy Bruton in terms of cross-Border co-operation on health issues given that one of the first decisions taken by the Northern Ireland Executive will be an unpopular one to close hospitals in places such as Omagh, Enniskillen and Dungannon? Co-operation across the Border might find a solution other than closing some of these hospital services. Was it a good idea for a procession of ministerial <Col N="1244" /> mercs to travel to Armagh yesterday? Will the Taoiseach agree that while we all condemn the bugging of cars, telephones and so on, we also condemn the use of car bombs in the past which a certain Deputy in this House did not do in his political life?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. The chairman recommended, however, that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members in support of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. The EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid. A key consideration which influenced its decision is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income <Col N="1246" /> are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemp-tion could change if dividends were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit, as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption from income tax of credit union dividends.</P>
    <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the working group. Consequently, I have no plans at this stage to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions. The differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving this matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his first budget the Minister brought forward proposals to alter the manner in which credit unions are taxed on the payout of dividends in particular, but then withdrew those proposals subsequently. I put it to him that he clearly believes change is necessary. Why, therefore, does he not bring forward change now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of accuracy, I did not bring forward proposals regarding credit unions in my first budget but subsequent to the budget, and before the publication of the Finance Bill, I acceded to a request from the Irish League of Credit Unions to meet me regarding proposals it had on the taxation of credit union savings. I pointed out clearly to the league, and it will admit this, that I had no plans whatsoever to do anything in the Finance Bill regarding credit unions, but the Irish League of Credit Unions, representing their members &ndash; or so I thought &ndash; put forward proposals on what it wanted, including the imposition of DIRT on credit union savings. I then brought forward in the Finance Bill of February 1998 proposals in that regard which started off a storm of protests from individual members. Arising from that I then withdrew the proposals, and there the matter has rested since. In the course of those consultations, I set up the working group which reported to me in the autumn of last year, and there the matter has rested since. I should also point out that when that working group was considering these matters, the issue of the EU dimension was not to the fore of its deliberations. The EU had not made a decision at that time on the complaints from a group in Ireland regarding the credit unions. I want to put the record straight in this regard. I did not bring forward any proposals in my first budget. It was after the budget when I met the credit unions, at their request, that they asked me to bring forward proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's recall is correct. I should have said the budgetary process rather than the budget. At the time of his first Finance Bill the Minister felt that change in the law was necessary. Is he not simply being vindictive now with the credit union movement? It was his first <Col N="1247" /> major U-turn, he got his fingers burned and he has been vindictive since with the credit union movement. He refuses to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions and I put it to him that he is being vindictive and he is not addressing a problem which should be addressed. There is a need for a change of law in this area &ndash; the Minister was of that view two years ago &ndash; and the way he is now carrying on is simply an exercise in vindictiveness.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can check this with the Irish League of Credit Unions, but I had no proposals or any intention of making changes in credit union taxation matters in the first Finance Bill. The Irish League of Credit Unions asked to see me and asked me to bring forward changes. I had no intention of making any change in that regard. My first mistake was to agree to meet the credit unions and the second was to go along with its proposals which then did not meet with universal agreement. That is the factual position on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be getting confused. Before the budget, the Irish League of Credit Unions requested a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to discuss this matter. I have received a number of requests from the Irish League of Credit Unions to meet me as a result of this issue, but I know its views on this matter; they are expressed quite forcibly in the working group's report. There is plenty of time between now and the Finance Bill, if I consider it necessary, to make whatever changes I desire. I want to make it clear, however &ndash;  the Deputy can check this directly with the credit unions &ndash; that I never had any intention of making changes until I succumbed to the wishes of the credit unions to make some changes between the publication of the budget in December 1997 and the publication of the Finance Bill. The record will show that and if the Deputy asks the Irish League of Credit Unions, it will testify to that also, as will the pub<Col N="1248" /> lic relations firm which requested the meeting on its behalf at the time.</P>

      <asker>Mr. McDowell</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the prospective cost over two years of completing the individualisation of the standard rate income tax band as set out in his Budget Statement on 1 December 1999</Quest>
      <QRef>[26900/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my budget speech, one of the main problems with our income tax system is the low level of income at which single people become liable at the top rate of tax. Single persons currently pay the top rate of tax on earnings less than the average industrial wage. One of the main difficulties with the current band structure is that the single person's tax band is doubled for all married couples. Consequently, I propose to move to individualisation of the standard rate band over the current and next two budgets. This will ultimately involve each individual having his or her own standard rate band. The effect of this change upon completion will be to reduce the percentage of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax from 46% to 17% of taxpayers, or 12% when exempt cases are included. This is consistent with the Government's An Action Plan for the Millennium, which committed the Government to a target of at least 80% of taxpayers not paying tax at the higher rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the costings sought by the Deputy, in my budget speech I stated that the full year cost of the first phase of individualisation, that is the widening of the band to a single band of £17,000, married one earner band of £28,000 and married two earner band of £34,000 with transferability between spouses up to a maximum band of £28,000 per annum for either spouse, will cost £310 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the costs in years two and three, the Deputy will be aware that I also pointed out in my speech that the Exchequer cost for each thousand pound widening of the band lessens as one goes up the income scales. This pyramid effect means the total cost of individualisation, if done in one move in the tax year 2000-1, would be £839 million, of which £310 million is for the first phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On current estimates, when full individualisation comes into effect, some 350,000 taxpayers will have been removed from the top tax rate and, as I indicated in my budget speech, the percentage on the top rate will have come down from 46% to 17%, or 12% when those on low incomes who are exempt from tax are taken into account. To put this another way, 83% of taxpayers will pay tax at the standard rate, or 88% of all taxpayers will be either paying tax at the standard rate or paying tax at marginal relief rates or will be completely exempt from tax. As I said in my <Col N="1249" /> announcement on 8 December, in light of the strong views expressed on the whole issue of individualisation, I propose to invite the social partners to consider the future development of the individualisation process in the course of the current talks on a successor agreement to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the reported comments of the Taoiseach that his Budget Statement of 1 December lacked balance? Does he agree that the fact the Taoiseach made such comments within a few days of the Budget Statement in itself necessarily diminishes his authority as Minister? Does he agree that if he does not pursue the project of individualisation of the standard rate bands, as he stated on 1 December, his authority as Minister for Finance will be entirely shot?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said &ndash; I was in his presence when he said it at the Cairde ball on Thursday night &ndash; and repeated subsequently that, as the process of individualisation proceeds, it will be necessary to keep the balance right between the stay at home carer and the individual. That is what he said on the Thursday night after the budget. In light of that and as was always the intention, I brought forward to this year's Finance Bill a proposal which was in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of June 1997 of a then £2,000 standard rated allowance to the stay at home carer.</P>
      <P>I agree it was not my intention to do so in this year's budget because I do not believe that the differential I created in this year's Finance Bill goes any way towards redressing the imbalance which persists between stay at home spouses and the double income family where both spouses go out to work. There was a perceived lack of balance and there was such an outcry about it that I brought this proposal forward. There would be an issue in terms of 2001-02 &ndash; that is what I referred to on many occasions since the budget and that is what the Taoiseach referred to on Thursday night. I recall no place where the Taoiseach said the budget lacked balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's response to mean that he does not believe his budget lacks balance. He told me today it would cost £839 million to move to complete individualisation, as set out by him on 1 December. It will cost roughly £0.5 billion to reduce the tax rates as set out in the Government's programme. Does the Minister agree that this leaves little scope for divergence from that strategy, that he is stuck with it for the next two years whatever might be agreed in the Partnership 2000 arrangements and that if he <Col N="1250" /> does not pursue this, his authority as Minister is greatly reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not point to the £839 million today . It was spelled out clearly in my budget speech of 1 December and detailed notes were given in annexes B and C as one progresses to the tax year 6 April 2002. I would have thought it was a laudable objective to try to ensure that in two years and four months time, 88% of taxpayers would be paying tax at the standard rate which will then be 20%. I set out clearly what I was going to do. The Deputy is right in that I do not believe my budget of 1 December lacks balance, and I am still strongly of that view.</P>
      <P>I also remind the Deputy that I cannot recall one trade union official from ICTU, SIPTU or any of the constituent organisations of ICTU complain about the individualisation concept because it has been on the agenda of trade union members for at least as long as I am in this House, but particularly since decisions in 1980 as a result of the Murphy judgment. If the Deputy can find a trade union leader who has spoken against individualisation, I will bow to his superior knowledge of the trade movement, but I am not aware of one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on 27 July 1998 to dispose of the State's interest in ICC Bank plc. The motivation for this decision was that there is no significant strategic or policy need for continuing direct State involvement in the banking sector.</P>
      <P>In February of this year I appointed ABN-AMRO and McCann FitzGerald to advise me in relation to the corporate finance and legal aspects of the sale of my interest in the bank. During the following months officials of my Department and my advisers worked with the board, management and staff of ICC Bank to prepare the necessary documentation in relation to the sale, to negotiate an employee share ownership trust and to agree the procedures for the sale process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the first stage, three indicative bids were received. It was decided that all three should enter into stage 2 of the sale process, where they would be permitted to carry out due diligence on ICC. One of these banks, National Australia Bank, withdrew from the process shortly thereafter, without commencing due diligence. The two remaining banks undertook a preliminary due diligence exercise on ICC and also availed of the opportunity to meet with key management and union officials. One of these parties, Irish Intercontinental Bank, then withdrew at a late stage and a single second stage bid, from Bank of Ireland, was received by the deadline of <Col N="1251" /> 19 October 1999. Its bid was substantially less than the top range of the earlier indicative bids.</P>
    <P>Following consultations with the board of ICC Bank, the receipt of advice from my financial advisers and a discussion with senior representatives of Bank of Ireland, I issued a press release confirming that Bank of Ireland would be admitted to the final due diligence process. I informed Bank of Ireland at that stage that I was not happy with the price it put on the table and that I wanted this increased. I saw no point in terminating the process prematurely without seeing what the outcome would be.</P>
    <P>Bank of Ireland made it known to me on Monday 6 December that it no longer wished to proceed with the acquisition. It fully acknowledged the strengths of ICC Bank in its specialist market segments but felt that acquiring ICC Bank was not the best way to develop its SME lending business. In the light of this turn of events, I withdrew ICC Bank from sale for the present.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in ICC Bank going forward. I am now providing for the extension of its borrowing requirements in the ICC Bank Bill, 1999, which has passed all Stages in the Oireachtas and is with the President for signature for enactment into law. Going forward, it is my intention to ensure that the bank remains adequately capitalised while it is under State ownership.</P>
    <P>The board, management and staff of ICC Bank have fully co-operated with the change process over the past months. I fully appreciate the role they have all played in the process. At all times their focus has been on building the quality and profitability of the bank. While all parties share the disappointment of a deal not being finalised at this juncture, the commitment of all the stakeholders of the bank remains undiluted.</P>
    <P>I will now be asking the board, management and staff to consider the options for the future of the bank in the light of current developments. I will fully consider all the options for a way forward on receipt of the views of these parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he has been extremely foolish in persisting with negotiations with one possible purchaser since 19 October and that his embarrassment is effectively his own fault and due to his imprudence in persisting when only one possible institution was willing to buy ICC Bank.</P>

I did not make it clear to Bank of Ireland my views at that stage but I was advised &ndash; I agreed with the advice &ndash; that it would be premature at that stage not to allow Bank of Ireland to proceed further with due diligence, which is what I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday, 6 December Bank of Ireland informed me that it was no longer interested in <Col N="1252" /> acquiring ICC Bank. It would have been foolish for me on 19 October not to allow Bank of Ireland to proceed with due diligence. It had participated in all stages of the process, was the only one left in the sale and we proceeded.

When the final bills come in, we will be able to let the Deputy have them. The process in which ICC Bank engaged in the lead up to this will stand to it in the future. I have withdrawn it from sale for the present and will reconsider the matter after discussions with the ICC Bank board and management in the near future. Much of the work that has been done will be of benefit to the ICC. The cost will be ascertained in the future and I will not have any difficulty in letting the Deputy know the final figures when the Department has them.</P>

      <P>I announced on Wednesday, 8 December 1999 that the Government has decided to bring forward a £3,000 per annum tax allowance at the standard rate of tax in respect of spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. This fulfills a promise made by the Government in the joint Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats statement issued prior to the June 1997 General Election of an allowance, then set at £2,000, for families in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>This undertaking was always on the list of measures to be pursued in the Government's two remaining budgets but has been implemented now to recognise the role of spouses who work in the home and to balance the tax relief measures announced in the budget on 1 December 1999 which addressed the position where both spouses were in paid employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific details of the operation of the scheme will be set out in the Finance Bill to be published next February. This tax relief will be worth up to £660 per annum to one income married families on the standard and higher rate of tax at all income levels but will be of greater proportionate value to lower income families <Col N="1253" /> because it is standard-rated.

What was announced last week is a direct cog from the election statement issued by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on 4 June 1997, no more or no less. There was considerable debate in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party earlier in 1997 when the commitment was to a £2,000 standard rate allowance to stay-at-home spouses who looked after children. That commitment was firmed up on 4 June 1997 to include stay-at-home spouses looking after children, the handicapped and the elderly. Nobody in the Fianna Fáil party could complain that there was an inadequate debate on this matter, given the long debate on it in 1997. The announcement last <Col N="1255" /> Thursday was an exact translation of the 1997 statement, though it was brought forward.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, this scheme is under review by an interdepartmental group which was established in April 1998 and which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to representatives from that Department, the group has representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The group met on a number of occasions and will be arranging to meet representatives of a number of organisations and a number of persons who indicated a desire to make oral submissions. The date for such oral presentations has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be early in the new year. The information furnished at these meetings will facilitate the group in bringing its work to a conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration.</P>
      <P>While the Revenue Commissioners keep the scheme under ongoing review, they have just completed a technical review of the scheme and this document has recently been circulated to the members of the interdepartmental group. However, it should be pointed out that the Revenue review has a very specific focus in that it aims to address only the technical and operational problems with the present scheme, with a view to making the scheme operate in a more effective and cost-efficient manner for its present target group.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some disability face in coping with everyday life. However, a particular difficulty with this scheme relates to its increasing cost in giving very generous tax benefits. The total cost to the Exchequer for 1998 was £14.4 million and it is estimated that the cost will rise to at least £17 million this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that people with significant mobility problems are excluded from the benefits of this scheme, which causes anger and frustration for them. However, the scheme is tar<Col N="1256" /> geted at those who are severely and permanently disabled regarding their physical mobility. The important point is that those who benefit under the scheme are very resistant to the notion of any tinkering with the scheme, as they believe it would not be possible to extend the benefits to other classes of disability without incurring prohibitive additional costs which they fear would ultimately result in lessening the benefits generally.</P>
      <P>The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is 5,400. It is a very generous scheme and perhaps if we were starting it again we would probably do what has been done in other countries, which use grants and other methods of dealing with the matter. When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was Minister for Health he suggested a change in the way people qualified for the scheme and all hell broke loose. It is such a generous scheme that if any changes were made to it, those who qualify under it at present would be upset, and I do not propose to do that. An interdepartmental group has been established, but given generous benefits under the scheme, it is not possible to extend it to any great extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister received a submission from those representing blind passengers, who are few in number. Given that blindness is not a medical condition, so to speak, but a loss of a faculty crucial to mobility, surely the Minister could make an allowance for the approximately 70 blind passengers in that lobby group without upsetting the present definition? Will he give serious consideration to providing for them, if he proposes to expand the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to give not only that group but many others further consideration in terms of extending this scheme. If one were to make any change to it and state that one form of disability should be included thereby implying others should not be included, one would create an imbalance. With the best will in the world and taking account of the small number of people involved in this lobby group, it is not possible to provide for them in this way.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for a Minister for Finance or any other Minister to state that one form of disability is less severe than another form of disability. This is where the difficulties in this area have arisen. The interdepartmental review group is trying to resolve these difficulties by bringing forward proposals. When we have examined this matter further, I will give the group to which the Deputy referred further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in this position for two years and six months, but these problems were in existence long before my time and bedevilled successive Administrations. There are tens of thousands of people with various forms of disability and each of them has a good and genuine case. Given the generosity of the benefits available under the scheme, its cost is quite considerable and <Col N="1257" /> extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with inordinate difficulties.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent documentation from the motor industry proposing a reduction in VRT for cars which comply with EU emissions directives while maintaining existing rates for cars which are non-compliant with these directives, would have a beneficial effect on the environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26660/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I received a pre-budget submission from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and I met representatives of the SIMI who explained their proposals. One of their main proposals was a reduction of 2.5% in the rate of vehicle registration tax on cars that comply with the current EU emissions directives while maintaining the existing rates for cars that are non-compliant with these directives. For example, the rate of VRT for compliant cars up to 1400 cc would be 20% as opposed to 22.5% for non-compliant cars.</P>
      <P>Since the 1970s, cars have been required to comply with various EU emissions standards, which are tightening all the time. New or brought in used cars, whether from inside or outside the Community, must comply with the standards pertaining to their year of manufacture. Further increases in standards are scheduled for next year and also for 2005.</P>
      <P>All new cars must comply with these requirements. In effect, the SIMI proposed an across the board reduction of 2.5% in the VRT rates for all new cars, despite record sales this year. As used cars brought in are generally older and will not be required to meet the 2000 or the 2005 standards, the SIMI proposal would discriminate in favour of new cars.</P>
      <P>The SIMI's proposal was given due consideration, but it was not considered favourably. While the SIMI presented the proposal as an environmental measure, if it had been accepted, the result would have been a reduction in VRT to achieve a standard for emissions that new cars must comply with in any event.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Deputy is well aware that car sales continue to soar. The figure for total net registrations to end November 1999 is 170,431. That is an increase of 26,424 ahead of last year's full year total. As I said here on numerous occasions, VRT is a valuable source of funding for the Exchequer. Net receipts to end November 1999 are in the region of £593 million.</P>

We have one of the highest rates of VRT in the European Union. In terms of excise duties on petrol and VAT and tax on cars, I am sure he will accept our motorists are among the most highly taxed motorists in the Union. Will he consider increasing the bottom band of VRT to include all cars under 1.6 litres in the Finance Bill as a gesture towards reducing the financial burden on motorists? We will table an amendment to that effect to the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments. I pointed out at that time that I did not believe the number of new car sales would suffer and I was proved correct. New car sales are at an all time high this year. The rebalancing measure I introduced did not affect the sale of new cars. Regarding the environmental impact I tried to ensure by way of that budgetary measure, figures will show the percentages changed in terms of the number of cars sold under 1,400 cc. etc. As an environmental measure, it had the desired effect. I do not want to enter into a debate with the Deputy on taxes on cars except to say that it costs a certain amount of money to run this country and taxes have be collected somewhere.</P>

I accept there are other ways of calculating the environmental impact in this regard and I do not have a closed mind as to how this problem should be addressed. As I said in reply to Deputy Deenihan's question, the changes I made last year did not affect the sale of new cars, which continued to increase, but it had a rebalancing impact. Figures will show there was a change in the purchasing pattern, which has had an environmental impact.</P>

I have stated on a number of occasions that this scheme provides wide and generous tax breaks. There are many thousands of people who are entitled to claim some form of disability, and to give the <Col N="1261" /> same level of tax breaks to all these groups would mean that the cost of the scheme would run to hundreds of millions of pounds.

      <P>I am taking a number of steps to implement the Government's commitment to provide for the mandatory external audit of the accounts of the party leaders' allowance. First, I am considering the various existing arrangements and the accounting and auditing aspects of the matter. In this regard my Department has prepared a draft discussion paper on these key issues which also addresses some options for implementation. Second, I am considering the procedural and legal issues for implementing the proposal and, in particular, whether it will be necessary to introduce legislation or if appropriate arrangements can be made administratively.</P>
      <P>Having completed these deliberations, I will then consult with the recipients of the allowance in Dáil Éireann on the matter. I intend to bring specific recommendations to Government early in the new year with a view to having a mandatory audit in place in respect of the relevant accounts for the year 2000.</P>

Various ideas are being put forward regarding how this matter could be dealt with and I intend to consider each of them. I hope to obtain agreement from all sides of the House in respect of the proposals I eventually bring forward.

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to reduce the relative tax payable on LPG in view of the fact that it is more environmentally friendly than other fuels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26906/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I received representations requesting that the excise duty rates on LPG be reduced and these were considered, as is normal procedure, in the context of the recent budget preparations. Member states must comply with the minimum rates of excise duty, in respect of the various dutiable products, which are laid down in EU directives. As the House is aware, I reduced the VAT inclusive excise duty rate on liquid petroleum gas for automotive use by 1.82p per litre in last year's budget. The current rate for this product is £41.75 per 1,000 litres or just above the permitted EU minimum level of £39.38 per 1,000 litres. Consequently there is little scope for a further reduction in that rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the excise duty rate for LPG for certain commercial and industrial uses, the current rate of excise duty is £14.30 per 1,000 litres while the EU minimum rate is £14.17 per 1,000 litres. Again there is little scope for further reduction. The minimum rate of duty laid down in the directive for LPG which is used for heating purposes is zero. The Irish duty rate on this product is £14.30 per 1,000 litres.</P>
      <P>EU proposals on the taxation of energy products, which are under discussion would, <i>inter alia</i>, require increases in certain EU minimum rates for LPG. While I have acted to reduce the rates of excise duty on LPG, I must take account of the EU position in regard to our commitments and freedom of action in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. Does he agree that LPG is a more environmentally friendly fuel and that it is desirable to find some means whereby, for example, the use of LPG in Dublin Bus vehicles could be encouraged? I understand that he received a submission which proposed the use of LPG on an experimental basis by Dublin Bus. If he thinks that there is limited scope for the use of excise duty rates to encourage the use of LPG, what other means are available to him to encourage its use?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that LPG is an environmentally friendly fuel. The total receipts in respect of LPG for all uses in 1998 was £4.13 million and the 1999 receipts are expected to be in the region of £3.9 million. If the Deputy has any further suggestions in this area, I would be glad to hear them.</P>

      <P>As I advised the House on 10 November last, the report of the implementation advisory group, which contains a considerable number of recommendations, was published on 23 June 1999 at which time I asked that interested parties make their views known so that as much public debate as possible on this issue could take place.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue which requires careful consideration before any decisions are taken. I have received representations from a wide variety of sources on this issue and am actively taking account of all of them in my considerations. No decisions have yet been taken on any aspect of the group's proposals. However, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I hope to bring joint proposals to Government in the near future in regard to the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the substantive disagreement is between the Minister and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment? He will be aware that his colleague told the House some weeks ago that she expected to bring joint proposals to the Government and, thereafter, to the House some time after the budget. When will the Minister for Finance bring them forward? I am sure he agrees that the fact that the matter has not been decided one and a quarter years after the Government's original decision in principle is causing difficulty.</P>

      <P>This is some time after the budget and, therefore, it is possible to bring the proposals forward. While the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I might have had disagreements on a wide variety of issues during the lifetime of the Government, I assure the Deputy that we have had none to date on any aspect of the report on the single regulatory authority which was produced by the implementation advisory group. As I pointed out during previous replies to questions on this issue, we decided on the establishment of a single regulatory authority in autumn 1998. We set up the advisory group and asked Mr. Michael McDowell to chair it. The nine people in the group came forward with three different proposals on the location of the authority. There was agreement on almost all the other issues, which related to the substance of the authority, but its location gave rise to three recommendations. I hope in the near future that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I will be able to bring a joint memorandum to the Government to dispose of this issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, by letter of 2 December 1999, has confirmed that the National Development Plan 2000-2006 complies with all the relevant provisions of the General Structural Funds Regulation. This clears the way for negotiations with the Commission of a community support framework in respect of the EU co-financed elements of the plan.</P>
      <P>Under the Structural Funds regulation these negotiations must be completed within five months of receipt by the Commission of the plan. Officials from my Department briefed the European Commission services on the plan on 8 December last as a prelude to the commencement of the negotiations on a CSF. At the Commission's request, the negotiations proper will get under way towards the end of January 2000.</P>
      <P>The operational programmes provided for in the plan will also have to be developed to facilitate implementation of it. It will be the responsibility of the specified managing authorities of the operational programmes, as indicated at paragraph 12.4 of chapter 12 of the plan, to engage in further consultation on the operational programmes with the bodies who will be implementing the measures in the programmes.</P>
      <P>The managing authorities will also have responsibility for preparing the programme complement, which is provided for under the Structural Funds regulation and which will set out the proposed allocations and detailed implementation arrangements for the operational programmes at measure level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point of ordering No. 40, which concerns the budget, when the budget is changing? What are the Taoiseach's plans in ordering this item this week given that the budget we are now considering is not the one referred to on the Order Paper, but a new one that is being altered all the time? Can the Minister for Finance be permitted to make a new statement in the debate this evening, revising the existing budget, so that from here on at least the debate can take place on a new statement with new financial tables and all the revised figures? We would facilitate any alteration of standing orders necessary to allow the Minister for Finance to speak twice in this debate, so that he can correct himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is in an unprecedented position. Effectively, we have had a budget that cannot be put through the House in its present form. We have been informed of that by a number of Deputies who still support the Government. The Minister for Finance has indicated a number of changes already, anywhere but in the Chamber. The decency of the House and the self-respect of the Government requires that the Minister for Finance should come to the House at some stage &ndash; the standing orders can be changed to facilitate that &ndash; to tell us what he is doing, who he is talking to, what changes will occur and how many more alterations there will be before the House votes on the full contents of the budget.</P>

      <P>As is normal, the budget debate goes on for some time after the budget is presented to the House. This year, because of the enormous tax break in the budget, of £1 billion, including £400 million in welfare, more Deputies than normal want to contribute to the debate to praise the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 2 which seeks to reinstate the good points in the Minister's initial Bill, while amending the 36-hour drinking binge provision. I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept this amendment and introduce legislation to allow for drinking. Some of his proposals are open to amendment if he wishes to bring them back to Committee Stage so we can introduce legislation which provides for drinking time up to 1.30 a.m. at weekends, and reduced drinking time during the rest of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he announced this legislation last sum<Col N="1286" /> mer the Minister said that he was serious about promoting tourism and that this proposal would be a kernel of that objective. There is no guarantee that this legislation will be in place for the summer, but this amendment would ensure that the new drinking laws are in place for the tourism season. That would give us a better opportunity to debate the other legislation when it comes before the House.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we use this opportunity to abolish Sunday afternoon closing. The current situation is ludicrous and out-dated and a change would offer an opportunity for publicans to provide an additional service on Sunday afternoons when soccer matches and so on take place. People cannot watch such events in pubs because of the laws.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced this legislation last summer and, on the advice of the Millennium Committee, proposed to introduce 36-hour drinking. It is ludicrous that he is now not willing to give one or one and a half hours to the public and that this measure will only apply to millennium night. Some of the Millennium Committee's decisions regarding candles and taxis have raised serious questions, but we have an opportunity to amend this legislation and introduce realistic drinking laws which apply not only to one night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very disappointed with the Minister's proposals on this Bill. The Minister knows that every publican and nightclub owner was expecting far more fundamental legislation. Heretofore, we were going to allow 24-hour drinking on new year's eve, but this was rejected by the vast majority of people, publicans and nightclub owners. The current proposal is to allow drinking until 1.30 a.m., but only new year's eve. It is disingenuous of the Minister to introduce this unnecessary legislation. We need proper legislation to extend drinking time so that people are dealt with as mature people who can go to public houses and nightclubs and act properly.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have included the introduction of a national identity card scheme in this legislation. Under age drinking is a huge problem. The lobbying by the drinks industry has been ignored which is disappointing. The Minister has acted badly. He gave the impression that he would introduce substantial legislation to modernise licensing hours. Pubs must still close between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday which is ridiculous and unnecessary. It is essential that the Minister introduce proper legislation. I do not know why he has even introduced this Bill. We have heard the song &ldquo;Banana Republic&rdquo; but this is going too far &ndash; we are more like a nanny State. We are mature enough for the introduction of proper drinking laws. The new millennium was an excellent opportunity to do that and the Minister did not take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 provides for the abolition of Sunday closing between 2 <Col N="1287" /> p.m. and 4 p.m. in licensed premises such as public houses. On Committee Stage, the House agreed with my view that the provision should be deleted from the Bill, on the basis that it would be more appropriately dealt with in the comprehensive and wide ranging No. 2 Bill on opening hours and other matters which is being drafted and will be introduced early in the new year with a view to enactment before the summer recess. Amendment No. 2 seeks to reinstate that section of the Bill which was deleted on Committee Stage. It seems that I must put the matter in context yet again for the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Bill was first published following calls from various sectors, not least in this House, for something to be done in respect of the hours between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday and Saturday night exemptions to assist the last summer tourist season. It was also proposed by the National Millennium Committee that I introduce special hours of opening on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. I was open to making the various changes, as I indicated on a number of occasions. However, what happened subsequently is clear. I have already dealt in detail with the circumstances which arose when the Bill was previously before the House.</P>

Due to the passage of time, the most reasonable action to take was to amend the Bill and provide solely for the eve of the millennium. This is the form of the current Bill. I realise Deputy Reynolds is a new customer. However, it would not be fair to the other customers who were here on the last occasion for me to go back over that again.</P>
      <P>This amendment, together with amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11, intends to go against the form which the Bill now takes. Their substance has been debated in great detail on Committee Stage and the only purpose they serve is a repetition of that debate. This is especially the case if the same Deputies who spoke on Committee Stage propose to speak on these amendments &ndash; many of them have taken the opportunity of doing so. Deputies will have many opportunities to discuss the details of the No. 2 Bill, which will include the measures which are the subject of these amendments. It is clear and simple.</P>

      <P>The urgency of some of the provisions last summer no longer applies. On a technical point, Deputies should be aware that, as the earlier motion to reinstate section 1 of the Bill as initiated, relating to definitions, has not been accepted and as such a section would be a necessary companion to the present and subsequent amendments, they are now flawed. However, I do not reject them on that basis but for the other reasons I gave<i> ad nauseam</i> on Committee Stage. It would not serve any worthwhile purpose for me to go into that debate again.</P>

As I walked back to Leinster House at 10.50 p.m., before the pubs closed, I counted 62 people waiting for a taxi at St. Stephen's Green. What provisions does the Minister plan to make for the millennium given his rejection of these amendments? This Bill is a figleaf of legislation, dealing with one night. What steps will the Minister take to ensure there will not be a swill of people on the streets when the pubs close as he has refused to accept any recommendation which would allow for the staggering of closing time? How will the Minister deal with the fact that during the Christmas period, hundreds of people will enjoy nights out without any possibility of getting public transport or a taxi home?</P>

The proposals will be contained in the more comprehensive legislation which will be discussed in detail prior to next summer. I have indicated that to the House on a number of occasions. There is no great mystery &ndash; if there is one, I cannot identify it.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Higgins' question on various Bills, being a modest person, I am loth to remind him that the legislative programme introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the past two and a half years is the equivalent of all the legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. There are approximately 28 Bills in the course of preparation and 12 Bills before the House. No doubt, in due course, we will get around to dealing with the legislation referred to by the Deputy. As to why it was considered urgent at the time, I explained the difference between the seasons to Deputy Higgins and there is little point in my expanding any further on that matter. One either knows or does not know it is winter.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;Section 5 of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended in subsection (3) (inserted by section 29 of the Act of 1988) by the deletion of 'for any time on a Sunday or' and the said subsection (3), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
      <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
      <P>(3)No special exemption order shall be granted for any time between one o'clock and half-past ten o'clock in the morning on a Monday.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward amendment to section 5, special exemption orders, of the Act of 1927. Effectively, this amends section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, by the deletion from subsection (3), inserted by section 29 of the Act of 1988, of the text which prohibits the granting of a special exemption order for any time on Sunday. In other words, it is no longer necessary in the context of what is now proposed. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment given that he elaborated in considerable detail on Committee Stage in June that he accepted the spirit of this measure.</P>

      <P>We will not convince the Minister that now is an opportune time to introduce this legislation. The Minister has promised to publish a new consolidation Bill in the new year. Will he guarantee that the Bill to be published in January will deal with between 33 and 34 previous Acts dating back to the 1830s and that it will go through both Houses of the Oireachtas before next June? Given that this is a comprehensive item of legislation, will the Minister guarantee that it will be enacted before the change in the licensing laws due to take place in the summer? I do not think it is possible to give such a guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity today to introduce the additional hour. This would give publicans and the general public an opportunity to extend the licensing hours. The Minister is in favour of this. It is ludicrous, given that earlier this year he was talking about 36 hours and we are now talking about an additional hour, that the Minister is not willing to introduce this measure. This is a straightforward amendment. We have an <Col N="1291" /> opportunity to ensure that the legislation is passed here today and is in place for the summer. This comprehensive legislation should not be rushed through the House. I do not believe the legislation will be in place for the summer. I hope the Minister will prove me wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reasonable grounds to be concerned at the length of time it may take for a comprehensive item of legislation to be put on the Statute Book. As the Minister rightly said, he has a lot of Bills on his plate at the moment. There are a large number of Bills promised and in the course of being enacted. With respect, the Minister can only do so much work and I am sure he would agree that a lot remains to be done. This is just one of the many tasks he and his Department must carry out. The Minister said he is an open and amenable person. We want the pubs to be open and amenable as the public wish. In reality, there is now a great temptation to break the law, particularly in relation to Sunday afternoon closing.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the main purpose of the legislation introduced last summer was to deal with the summer season. I put it to him that there are good reasons in the winter season to change the two hours on Sunday afternoon as soon as possible. People to into pubs following various sporting activities. If one walks on the hills of Clare, Kerry or Limerick during the winter, it is fairly dangerous to be out after 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Following these walks, people like to be able to go into the pub before it gets too dark to change into their dry clothes in the heat. This usually happens before 4 o'clock. Given that people are involved in walking and other activities and some families like to go out for family lunch, there tends to be a great temptation to break the law or to encourage the publican to break the law.</P>
      <P>While the summer season may be the main reason for the introduction of the legislation, it should also apply to the winter season and the whole year. We tabled these amendments to try to ensure that legislation suitable to modern life is put in place as soon as possible. Deputy Higgins asked when the legislation will be enacted fully so that we can have modernisation of the licensing laws.</P>

      <P>It is not what the Bill provides for, rather what it does not address that prompted my participation in this debate from the outset. I am not opposed to the millennium provision proposed by the Minister. However, I have no particular enthusiasm for it and I do not think any Member necessarily has. My decision to contribute on Report Stage has been determined by the Minister and Deputy Collins's response last week to earlier contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's decision to signpost a two-tier approach to late opening times when the main Bill is introduced in the House. <Col N="1292" /> That is my opinion to which I am entitled and which I hope will be respected by Members on all sides. In relation to a three day by three day set of opening hours, I am not opposed to the sense of that approach, other than the point made by Deputy Collins that there is no demand on the part of the vintners or the vintners' bodies.</P>
    <P>I have two reasons for pursuing my particular interest in this issue. It is essential that we address the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to help create a more mature approach and understanding of alcohol, its use and abuse.</P>
    <P>The other issue relates to the whole sector of the exploitation of young people, in particular through the various entertainment locations, the late licensing of same and the use of these venues by people who are clearly only intent on securing additional alcohol. This has resulted in tremendous disquiet and a great deal of suffering and hardship for many people. I might like to see freer opening times than these amendments would allow if they were adopted or included by the Minister in a substantive Bill to come before us, hopefully early in the new year.</P>
    <P>These are very important issues. The extension of the hours along the lines included in the amendments initially tabled by Deputies Higgins, Flanagan, O'Sullivan and myself are reflective of a good sense approach because they are not compulsory, they do not have to be adhered to by those at the coal-face of delivering alcoholic beverages and, despite the Minister's dismissal of our claim, they are also reflective of a lobby and an interest from within the profession. I refute the Minister's claim that the amendments tabled by myself and other Deputies are personal positions only. They certainly reflect my position, although I would be prepared to consider even freer proposals.</P>
    <P>I made the point last week that the document I hold in my hand, distributed by the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, was directed to the Minister in June of last year. It carries amendments (a) and (b) as suggested methods of address of the deficiencies in the Bill then before the House, and that is exactly what I have presented in my amendments. I believe they are important.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by this Bill and its failure to include the substantive issues at the core of this debate. The millennium is but a distraction and of little importance in my book. I would like to see the measures that we have mooted here in various amendments incorporated in the Minister's substantive legislation and in the absence of argument that supports, in a very real and acceptable way, the earlier closing hours on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I hold to the view that it is better that we free up right across the board, Monday through Saturday.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the argument put by Deputy Collins last week that, as guests of hotels, tourists have the right of access to service. It is important that we acknowledge that the tourist market addresses not only the visitor from overseas, who may be able to afford to stay in our <Col N="1293" /> hotels, but also many Irish tourists, the indigenous market, who utilise the services of bed and breakfast accommodation which has no licence provision. They enjoy, as I would, the opportunity for a late drink on any evening of the week by choice. It is critically important that we create and provide choice. It does not hold up to narrow the sense of the tourist market in the way the contribution last week sought to do. Thankfully, it is a much wider appeal.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment as presented by Deputies Higgins, Naughten and O'Sullivan, and I hope the noted acrimony that entered this debate in the recent past will not discourage the Minister from considering the salient and important points Members argued for the inclusion of these changes when the substantive Bill comes before us.</P>

      <P>The Bill is merely a millennium provision. I do not understand this debate because we have got a guarantee from the Minister that he will bring a comprehensive Bill before the Dáil early in the new year. He stated that Sunday night closing time will remain as it is &ndash; 11 p.m. with 30 minutes' drinking up time. Closing time on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be 11.30 p.m. with 30 minutes' drinking up time, and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights closing time will be 12.30 a.m. with 30 minutes' drinking up time. I do not understand why there is so much filibustering because both the Dublin and the country licensed vintners have accepted the Bill, and I do not know who the Members opposite are speaking for on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with the substance of my opposition to these amendments <Col N="1294" /> in the debate on amendment No. 2. Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 are inter-related because they all provide in one form or another for extension of opening hours of licensed premises such as hotels and licensed restaurants and for registered clubs. Amendment No. 3 allows for special exemption orders to be granted after midnight on a Saturday. The other amendments, Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 11, are consequential on acceptance of amendment No. 2. As amendment No. 2 has been defeated, it is illogical that these amendments should form part of the Bill. They would give to clubs, hotels and restaurants Sunday opening hours more favourable than pubs currently have.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said in relation to amendment No. 2. On Committee Stage, the provisions to which all of these amendments relate were debated and the House agreed with my view that those provisions should be deleted from the Bill. This was on the basis that they are more appropriately dealt with in the comprehensive and wide-ranging No. 2 Bill on opening hours, to which Deputy Collins referred, and other matters, which is in the course of being drafted and which will be introduced in the early part of the new year with a view to enactment before the summer recess. Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 now seek to restate those sections of the Bill which were deleted on Committee Stage. I cannot accept the amendments as proposed.</P>
      <P>The split week, which was referred to during the debate, is something which Deputy Flanagan's own committee proposed. I am not saying Deputy Flanagan was critical of it &ndash; he was not &ndash; but it is what his committee proposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke about a failure to deal with the main issues. I have explained that more comprehensive legislation will be brought forward in the new year. It is true that the Bill does not deal with the whole question; it deals only with the night of the millennium. There is no compulsion on anybody to go into a public house on the night in question but I am merely trying to facilitate people to do so if they wish. That was on foot of a recommendation I received from the millennium committee and I have outlined already how I was amenable and open to any suggestions. It would be a fallacy for me to pretend this legislation was anything other than a small amendment to the licensing laws to facilitate people having a night out on new year's eve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Naughten proposed that we could consolidate the intoxicating liquor laws. Intoxicating liquor law in this country is spread across about 70 different statutes. Consolidation of those statutes would be a mammoth task. It would take several years and I do not have the time or the resources to do it at this point. The last consolidated Act was in 1830 and, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no attempt at consolidation since then. It leads me to the historical fact that the first statute dealing with intoxicating liquor was enacted in 1635. If one considers that there was only one consolidating Act since then, one can appreciate the type of task it must be. As <Col N="1295" /> I said, much drinking up time has gone under the bridge since 1635.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of winter time and why we cannot abolish the 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. closing during winter time. I accept people find it awkward that they are not in a position to go into public houses between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon and that is why I wanted to leave that to the more comprehensive Bill in the new year. I want to deal with that and the other matter in the comprehensive Bill because the summer season is gone. It is best I deal with all these matters together rather than in a piecemeal way at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>In any event, this Bill is to facilitate people having a night out on the eve of the millennium. Knowing the vagaries of the parliamentary draftsman's office and so on, I cannot say the legislation will definitely be on the Statute Book by the summer, but I am doing everything&mdash;</P>

The problem is the Minister cannot guarantee this legislation will be in place next summer. I would say to Deputy Collins that we are all in agreement about the changes that need to be made. The only dispute is when they should be implemented. Last summer it was urgent that we introduce this legislation because of the tourism season, and the Minister promoted it. Tourists do not come to Ireland in the summer months only. We now have an all year round tourism industry, with many people coming here during the winter months.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister not consider extending drinking hours for those tourists or will they be discriminated against? I cannot understand why the legislation was urgent last summer but now the Minister cannot guarantee it will be in place by next summer. The current legislation encourages people to break the law &ndash; I am sure the Minister has broken the liquor licensing laws and that Deputy Collins has done the same. It is also a huge drain on Garda resources. Will the Minister reconsider his decision, accept this amendment, introduce the legislation now and give us an opportunity to resolve this problem?</P>

At the same time, if our amendments were accepted they would have the opportunity to open late everyday. In some circumstances &ndash; Deputy Ó Caoláin made the point about tourists from here and abroad &ndash; there are genuine reasons people might wish to have a drink late at night earlier in the week and at weekends.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable this year's Exchequer allocation of £3 billion for pre-funding of social welfare and public service pensions to be held in a temporary fund pending the enactment of substantive legislation next year, providing for the establishment of pension funding arrangements on a permanent, ongoing basis. This is a short Bill and before dealing with its specific provisions I will outline the background to what is essentially a new departure in the management of our public finances.</P>
      <P>Effective economic and budgetary management requires us to anticipate and plan strategically for emerging problems and challenges that lie ahead over the long-term. In recent times, Ireland has been enjoying very favourable demographic conditions which have contributed significantly to our strong economic performance, but this is set to change over the next half a century. In Ireland today, for every one person over 65 there are five persons of working age. Current demographic projections show that by the middle of the next century this ratio will rise to one person over 65 for every two persons of working age. This ageing process is occurring right across Europe, but in many European countries it is more advanced than in Ireland. We are fortunate, relative to other countries in that we have a demographic time bomb which is ticking slowly and we have the time and the resources to defuse it.</P>
      <P>The demographic changes that lie ahead will have major implications for the Exchequer. While long-term projections are unavoidably tentative, an indication of the potential scale of the problem was presented in a report published in July this year by my Department &ndash; the Report of the Budget Strategy for Ageing Group. The group estimated that, on the basis of current pay-as-you-go policies, by 2025 the Exchequer cost of broadly maintaining the current level of pensions and health service provision will have risen by about 4.5% of GNP or more than £2.6 billion.</P>
      <P>By 2050, this cost will have risen by 7% of GNP &ndash; that is, by more than £4 billion. Put another way, the increased Exchequer costs associated with ageing will require a 17 % increase in overall taxation levels by the middle of the next century merely to maintain the existing level of service. Any relative improvements that might occur in pension provision and health care would add further to this cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot turn a blind eye to this problem, distant though it may seem to many of us today. The demographic projections make it plain that to continue to fund pension provisions on a pay-<Col N="1301" /> as-you-go basis is to put at risk the security of future pensions or the State's capacity to allocate public finances for other social services. I have noted the major difficulties that other EU countries are now beginning to experience by not providing adequately in better economic times for demographic changes and I am determined Ireland will not make the same mistake.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the decision announced by the Government last July to set aside 1% of gross national product annually from the budgetary arithmetic towards the Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions in the future. In addition, a major portion of the proceeds of the Telecom flotation is being allocated for this purpose. In all, the Government is setting aside £3 billion this year for pension funding and I will explain the makeup of this sum in a moment.</P>
    <P>In the year 2000, a further £1.15 billion which is due from the Telecom sale will also be allocated for pension funding, along with the 1% of GNP allocation for that year, estimated at £635 million. Thus, by the end of next year, an estimated £4.8 billion will have been set aside for pension funding purposes. This will provide a strong initial injection to the process and will be supplemented by further annual allocations of 1% of GNP in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the level of funding proposed, substantial as it may seem, will only enable us to partially fund the extra costs associated with the ageing population over the next 50 years. Estimates prepared by my Department suggest that full funding of these costs would require an annual allocation of about 3.5% of GNP as opposed to a 1% allocation. Pre-funding this liability in full is not a practical proposition. However, the initiative that the Govermnent has taken will ensure that the ageing problem, when it does impact on the taxpayer, will be a great deal more manageable than it would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>This Bill enables the payment of up to £4.3 billion into a temporary holding fund in 1999. This sum is made up as follows: 1% of GNP in the current year, equal to £582 million on the basis of my Department's latest estimate of GNP; the flotation of Telecom Eireann, which raised £3.667 billion, and the Government has decided to use £1.25 billion of this sum to pay off Exchequer liabilities to the pension funds of Eircom and An Post, reducing the proceeds of the sale to £2.417 billion. These Exchequer liabilities are in respect of service of staff of the companies in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This sum, £2.417 billion, is being allocated to the temporary fund. When added to the £582 million referred to, payments to the fund come to £2.999 billion.</P>
    <P>Interest realised on the sum of £2.999 billion in the current year comes to an estimated £16 million and this also is being allocated to the fund. Further accrued interest of £19 million will be credited to the fund in the new year. Altogether, this brings the total to be paid to the fund this <Col N="1302" /> year to £3.015 billion. This being the case, Members may ask why section 1 (3) will permit payments to the fund of up to £4.3 billion. The reason for the higher sum is that, at this stage of the year, the payment to the Eircom pension fund has not been finalised while the payment to the An Post pension fund has only just issued from my Department. It is anticipated that the payment to the Eircom fund will be made shortly and the higher figure is there merely as a precaution. Should there be a hitch in finalising these transactions this year, then the amounts could be paid into the temporary holding fund.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (4) provides that moneys in the fund will be placed in deposit accounts or invested in other short-term financial products within or outside the State and that any income arising therefrom will be held or reinvested by the fund. I draw the attention of Deputies to section 1 (5) which provides that moneys may not be withdrawn from the fund without further legislation expressly authorising it and this provides a guarantee that the money that is now being allocated to the temporary fund cannot be accessed by the Government without the House having an opportunity to debate both the funding policy which the Government has adopted and the arrangements that the Government proposes for implementing that policy.</P>
    <P>The accounting arrangements for the fund are contained in section 1(6), (7) and (8). Accounts will be prepared by the NTMA and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accounts as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that control and management of the fund be delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency by Government order, as the NTMA is the State agency possessing the systems and expertise to manage such a large sum of money and it is essential that the task of managing this money should be assigned to it. In its role as manager of the Exchequer account, the NTMA is currently managing the proceeds from the Telecom flotation and the 1% of 1999 GNP allocation for pension funding. These moneys have been placed on short-term deposit by the NTMA with various financial institutions to mature at various dates in 1999 and 2000. These institutions conform with the counterparty risk criteria specified in guidelines issued to the agency and with the agency's own internal counterparty risk limits. Section 3 contains the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a holding measure and the House will have an opportunity to fully debate the pension funding issue when I bring forward substantive legislation in the new year providing for the establishment and management of two separate funds: one for social welfare pensions and one for public service pensions. This legislation, which is currently being prepared in my Department, will provide for annual Exchequer subscriptions to the funds and for subsequent drawdowns from <Col N="1303" /> the funds to meet Exchequer pension costs. It will also set out arrangements for the administrative control and management of the funds, a high level investment mandate within which this is to be exercised and a framework for reporting to the Dáil on the financial state and performances of the funds. It is envisaged the legislation will facilitate the transfer of moneys in the temporary holding fund to the permanent funds and provide for the winding up of the temporary fund.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that making provision for funding pension liabilities of the State is consistent with the recommendations of the national pensions policy initiative, which highlighted the need for action in this area. It has been made possible by the economic successes we have worked hard to achieve. More importantly, it can be implemented within a sustainable budgetary strategy that will also allow for substantial infrastructural and other capital investment under the national development plan, for continuing reduction in the tax burden, for ongoing improvements in public services and for ongoing reduction in the national debt. This initiative is about taking a longer term perspective of the State's economic and financial planning with a view to maintaining living standards and the quality of public services in the future. I have no doubt that in time our children and our children's children will reap the benefits of this prudent and sensible initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on whether we should fund our public service pensions has been ongoing for some time. I was one of the people three years ago who suggested it was time to move from the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis we operate at present to a funded basis. I would like to establish precisely what the Minister proposes. Given the desire to set aside 1% of GNP at the end of 1999 together with certain funds from Eircom, the Minister needs to legislate to set up a fund on a temporary basis so that he can hold this money on deposit or in short-term financial instruments pending the establishment of two pension funds he intends to establish by way of legislation later next year. That is the proposal before us. If that is the case, the reason the Minister is doing this is self-evident &ndash; the legislation on the pension funds is not ready, he has money he cannot retain legally without the authority he is requesting under this legislation and, as the end of the calendar year is approaching, he needs the Bill to go through before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister justified in setting up funded pensions? He announced the proposal last August but it was not debated either then or since. The announcement was greeted by favourable editorials, but we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter since then. While this is a major policy issue, there has been virtually no debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This generation of taxpayers is being asked not only to fund present pensioners on a &ldquo;pay as you <Col N="1304" /> go&rdquo; basis but future pensions by contributing to a pension fund. As a result of the Minister's decision, in effect, this generation of taxpayers is being asked to pay twice. One can justify that in present circumstances when we are running surpluses. What better use for a surplus than to fund pensions, but are we justified in making the switch from a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system to a funded system at this time?</P>
    <P>The Minister has justified this by stating that in future we will reach a position, which many of our European colleagues will reach ahead of us, where the burden of paying for pensions will be onerous on taxpayers. In effect, he has said that the burden will be so onerous that if we continue on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis we may not be able to afford the generous pensions now in place and the pensions of people who are entering the workforce now could be put at risk if we do not start funding pensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the middle of the next century. I do not know if he read an article on this matter in the <i>Financial Times</i> some weeks ago, which set out comparative tables for Europe. At present about 2.4% of our GNP goes towards funding pensions and that will have increased to only 2.6% by 2040. If those statistics are correct, the Minister is exaggerating the matter because the position here will not deteriorate dramatically until 2048, 2049, 2050 and into the 2050s. For the next 40 years there will be little variation in the burden of pensions on our society, but that is not true elsewhere in Europe. That statement of statistics shows that some European countries will have a burden of up to almost 20% of GNP, a burden of 17% to 19% of GNP is quite common. I would like the Minister to return to this matter because he is exaggerating the position and, in effect, bringing forward the date of the crisis which will not occur until the second half of the next century. Many entering the workforce for the first time on 1 January of the millennium year will be well and truly retired and on pension before the crisis hits. The Minister is being extraordinarily prudent by making provision for this very far in advance. It could be said that pensions have a long lead-in time and what better time to fund them than when the budget is in surplus. I would like further justification of the measures the Minister proposes.</P>
    <P>When we move from the temporary fund to the two pension funds proposed by the Minister, other issues arise. Will the two funds be separate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Many public servants have contributory pensions and their contributions go into the general body of taxation as there is no fund. Does the Minister intend that the contributions of those public servants with contributory pensions will be paid into the fund in future? Does he also intend that the social insurance fund will be constantly active? Does he intend that PRSI contributions will go into the social insurance fund and that benefits from the social insurance fund will be paid out on an ongoing basis, or does he intend it to be a social insurance old age contributory pension fund or a social insurance ongoing benefit fund out of which the various benefits with which we are familiar will be paid? How will he treat the contributions in those circumstances? What mechanism will be put in place?</P>
      <P>How will the fund be invested? In terms of the temporary fund, the Minister is doing what is prudent. He proposes to put the money on deposit or in short-term financial instruments. That will not involve any risk and the money will be transferred from the holding fund to pension funds later next year. I have no problem with that, but what will be the position on the pension funds? What will be the investment mandate? Will the investments be made domestically or abroad?</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister's proposal being praised by economists on the basis that it will give a new instrument of policy to the Minister for Finance and that, in effect, it will be used as a mechanism to take heat out of the economy when it is overheating. That would be a valid macroeconomic policy instrument, but it is only valid if the investment in the fund is offshore. There is no point in not heating the economy by taking out 1%, 1.5%, 2% or varying the scale of what is taken out, if it is all reinvested domestically. I would like the Minister to give a clear statement on whether he envisages the pension funds will be invested in Ireland. Does he envisage they will be invested to make up for our infrastructural deficit and, in effect, will assist the Government in its capital budget? Does he envisage they will be invested in Irish equities or abroad in equity markets in Europe and in the United States, because a policy issue hangs on the way the Minister intends to treat the fund subsequently? If he wants to use the fund, in a Keynesian way, as an instrument of macroeconomic policy to remove heat from the economy or to allow movement within it by varying the percentage at various stages, there will be a number of subsequent investment consequences. On the other hand, if the Minister sees the fund solely as a means for setting money aside for pension purposes and if he does not believe there will be any consequences in macroeconomic terms, another series of issues will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> That leads me to a question which has already been raised by a number of commentators. Is it appropriate that so much money will be completely denied to members of this generation at a time when there is such an infrastructural deficit, when the public transport system is probably the worst in Europe, when the roads structure is so bad and when many waterways have been polluted by untreated sewage? What is the Government's policy in this area? Does it intend to fund its capital programme by way of back-to-back loans against the pension fund? Will it be able to secure loans for investment purposes from the pension fund?</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by the Minister's contribution which did little to illustrate his thinking on this matter. The issues of a policy nature which arise in this area are serious. The House is co-operating with the Minister in pushing through the Bill and he should have given Members further information in respect of his ultimate intent following the establishment of the pension funds.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate when permanent legislation will be introduced? If he provides answers to my questions, we will be able to give the Bill an easy passage. However, a number of issues &ndash; these are not specifically relevant to the Bill but to its successor &ndash; arise in terms of establishing the pension funds and these must be aired now in order that we can debate them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing a major step in respect of the treatment of pensions and there are large amounts of money involved. In the budget he announced that in the order of £630 million or £640 million would be set aside next year. That is a great deal of money and it disappeared out of the budgetary arithmetic. There is so much money around at present that this provision was passed without debate or comment. I recall when Cabinets met late into the night for the sake of deciding how to spend £5 million, but those times are gone.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in principle because it is time to move towards a funded position. However, we need further information about the detail of this measure before I would be as enthusiastic in my reply as the Minister was in his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this is an interim measure which will remain in force until the Government publishes permanent legislation next year. As such, I do not intend to oppose the Bill. Having said that, however, I wish to make it clear that I am concerned that we are being asked, in a sense, to endorse the legislative equivalent of a pig in a poke. On behalf of my party, I wish to state that we will sign no blank cheques today. The fact that we do not object to the Bill does not imply that we are happy to accept whatever the Government may serve up when it introduces primary legislation next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am genuinely flabbergasted by the complete lack of public debate on this issue. The decision <Col N="1307" /> announced by the Government towards the end of July represents one of the most significant decisions taken by a Minister for Finance in recent years. The notion that we should set aside money &ndash; much less that we should set aside billions if not tens of billions of pounds &ndash; which should not be touched for a quarter of a century or more is radical enough, but the sheer scale of this ongoing commitment, which will bind not only the current Administration for the remainder of its term of office but which, hopefully, will also bind the Minister for Finance's successors into the first quarter of the next century, makes the Minister's decision one of virtually revolutionary proportions. We are proposing to set aside more money this year than we spent on national roads during the 1990s. The approximately £3 billion being set aside today is £500 million more than the Exchequer element of the PCP for the past year.</P>
    <P>A number of days ago a colleague reminded me that for many years we have been at pains to explain why it was impossible for us to reach the target of 0.7% of GNP as a commitment on overseas development aid. We painfully increased our contribution by 0.1% or 0.2% year after year until it reached its current rate of 0.35%. The Minister will be aware that his Department had grave difficulty with the notion of reaching targets gauged in terms of the percentage commitment related to GNP. The Department is much more comfortable with the notion of cash targets as opposed to those which are related, implicitly or explicitly, to growth.</P>
    <P>Despite such difficulties in respect of an issue of undoubted merit, it has suddenly become possible to find 1%, fully 0.3% more than our overseas development aid target, not just this year or next year but for the next 25 years. The House is being asked to make such a commitment with scarcely an hour to debate the enabling legislation. Let me cut to the bottom line. I agree that we should be seeking in advance to make provision for the demographic shift which is likely to happen in between 20 to 25 years. I also agree that provision for pensions will necessarily form an important part of that provision. However, above and beyond that, I suspect there will be a great deal to separate the Minister and I when we discuss this issue in greater detail next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a long-term issues paper which was published by his Department at the end of 1998. I read it recently and I was struck, not surprisingly, by the disclaimers which leap from the front page. These state that readers are reminded that short-term forecasts are rarely fully accurate, that they are frequently significantly inaccurate and that long-term analysis is even more prone to inaccuracy. I do not blame the authors of the document for stating this because I would have written much the same myself. The paper to which I refer was based on an actuarial assessment carried out by the Department of Social, Community and Family <Col N="1308" /> Affairs approximately two to three years ago and I am aware that the CSO has also carried out work in this area in the interim. The problem is that these things change and they do so radically and quickly.</P>
    <P>The birth rate in Ireland was among the highest in Europe for many years but it collapsed in the 1980s before appearing to recover somewhat during the 1990s. Equally important is the issue of emigration. During the 1980s we lost many thousands of citizens &ndash; approximately 1,000 per week at one stage &ndash; to emigration but many of them are returning to Ireland and having or rearing their children here. As Members are aware, the immigration of non-nationals has begun to rise at a significant rate. Who among us knows how matters will develop in the next number of years, not to mention the next 25 to 30 years?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Noonan, I read the <i>Financial Times</i> a number of weeks ago and I found the figures quoted quite striking because they sit uncomfortably with the predictions on which the Minister is basing his decision. The figure, as a percentage of GDP, for Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> the cost of pensions for 1995 was gauged in the article at 3.6%, falling to 2.9% in 2000 and rising again in the year 2040, with little variation in between. It is true to say that the figures for other European countries in respect of this area are amazing. For example, the figure for Spain is 10%, for France it is 10.6% and the figures other countries rise as high as 20%. It is clear that many of our European colleagues have a genuine and immediate problem, not to mention having one 20 years from now. It is fair to say that the debate on this matter in Ireland, in so far as one has taken place, has been informed by the difficulties which other European countries, Italy and Germany not least among them, have experienced.</P>
    <P>The source of that information quoted in the article to which I refer was the OECD. I do not know from where the OECD obtained the figures but I assume they were supplied from domestic sources. If the figures are accurate and if the burden of pension costs is due to remain roughly the same as a percentage of our national income, this entire debate is, in a sense, based on a false premise. We must ensure that the position is monitored carefully.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the immediate experiences of other countries and seen predictions in relation to these countries for future years and we must be aware of further developments in that regard. However, we must also be increasingly aware of the need to be flexible and to understand that things change. Many people in my party have difficulty with the Bill. Those who spent long hours in negotiation with the Department of Finance trying to wring an extra £5 million or £10 million here or there for a pet project during five years of Government until 1997, have grave difficulty accepting that we can set aside 1,000 times that in an Act of the Oireachtas passed in less than an hour in the House without a great deal of debate. I understand that. However, we do not want to <Col N="1309" /> posit false choices, at least not at this time. The reality is that we can afford to set aside money or money in this measure now, without having to cut back on services elsewhere because, as the Minister rightly noted, we still seek to run a significant surplus this year, notwithstanding the fact that we are taking so much money out of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is important that people should understand, for the moment at least, that we do not have to forgo improvements in services to make provision for payment of pensions in 2025. In simple terms we are not asking today's taxpayers to suffer for the benefit of tomorrow's pensioners. If we did that, we would find that the equable consensus that has existed in regard to this measure would evaporate rapidly. For these reasons, any funds set up will require significantly greater flexibility in their management than the Minister has so far suggested. To put it even more bluntly, if in five years time we have to choose between putting money into the heath services and putting it aside for pensions, many in my party and on this side of the House would choose to do the former.</P>
    <P>Significant moneys are available following the privatisation of Telecom Eireann. The economy is going well and is likely to continue in that vein for a few years. In those circumstances it is right to make provision, but if circumstances change and the pace of economic growth slows dramatically, our priorities will have to be re-examined. I do not suggest that the fund should be raided but we might have to look again at the rate of set aside if the economic choices become more difficult than they currently are. The business of politics is about determining priorities for the moment and acting accordingly. I agree with the priority given to this issue in current circumstances but I am not willing to allow this Minister or this Government to predetermine the priorities of my party into the next century.</P>
    <P>I will reflect on some issues which will necessarily arise next year during the debate on establishing the funds. This is a demographic problem which results from the fact that a shift in the level of dependency is reasonably expected in approximately 25 years. It is right that pensions are an important part of our consideration, but they are not the only part and may not even be the most important. That there will be more old people will impose considerable extra stress on health services, for example, which currently they could hardly bear. Undoubtedly, more provision will be needed for nursing homes and the care of older people generally. A mechanism must be found whereby such provision is also made. In reality, pensions are money in people's back pockets and, while it is right that the we make provision now to give people money in 25 years, a broader brush approach also needs to be taken. We must ensure that funds available now are used to cater for the broader demographic problem and the greater level of care that will be necessary for a greater number of older people in 25 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> We cannot ignore the needs of the economy now and in the intervening time. Deputy Noonan touched on the present infrastructural deficit, and it would be appropriate to use the surpluses being generated to fund back to back loans in the private and public sectors in future years when Government surpluses are not sufficient to provide funding. We had a limited debate on public- private partnerships in recent months. It has been suggested that the Minister's Department is less than enthusiastic and he denies that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe so. In so far as there is a decent argument to be made against the use of PPPs in the current circumstances, it has to come down to the funding mechanism where the argument is often made that the State can access money more cheaply than the private sector and the fact that that is the case and the State at the moment has no problem getting money means that the benefits of PPPs are not extensive. Certainly when one weighs up the financial disadvantage against the rest and against the benefits on the operational side, the argument is made that they do not quite balance up.</P>
      <P>Surpluses, and funds of this kind, can be constructively used to alleviate that problem. It may well be possible for designated PPP purposes for some of this fund to be used to provide loans at preferential rates to the private sector specifically for PPPs that would deal with infrastructural issues. There is a role in examining these funds for the development of the economy, which will still ensure that the capital investment and more will be available at maturity in 25 years time or longer for the purposes for which we are setting up the funds in the first place, namely the pensions.</P>
      <P>Many people, looking at where we are now, in terms of the level of benefits paid out will say that, given that old age pensioners will be paid £96 per week next year, why not make additional provision now rather than setting aside enormous amounts of money for payment in a quarter of a century? Old age pensions, as the Minister knows, are the better end of the argument from the social welfare point of view. A payment of £96 a week is a good deal more than some of the social welfare benefits that are currently being paid out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we now reached a level of payment for old age pensioners which is acceptable, or should we use funds available to us now to improve the level of benefit to pensioners who are currently receiving benefit from the State, rather than saying we will set aside money now for 25 years' time? The answer is there. There is still some distance to go before the people in this House who make the decisions can be comfortable with the level of benefit we are paying out to the pensioners that are there today. I would not like the Minister to go away for Christmas without thinking that we had not noticed this.</P>
      <P>It took me a little while to come to terms with the Minister's new training fund, following the budget. It seems that he is depleting the social insurance fund by juggling with the levies there, reducing the Estimate for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment by £126 million in order to ensure that his 4% spending target remains, theoretically at least, on target and is setting aside part of the social insurance fund for a new training fund which will continue to do what the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does already through FÁS. This is of some relevance in that the Minister clearly believes that there is enough money already in the social insurance fund. He is not using the money already available to him to increase benefits and that is a mistake. I am also unclear as to how the social insurance fund, which is in surplus for the first time, will relate to the new fund. Will the social insurance fund continue as an interim fund for the next 25 years and will it then be supplemented by moneys from the new pension funds for the following 25 years?</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan raised a number of questions on the management of the fund. I am a little bothered that the Minister has not explored them today. We need to have some indication as to whether it is intended that this money should be actively managed or passively managed. Should it simply be on deposit or used for investment in equities? Should it be used to intervene in the economy? Should it be invested abroad or at home? We need details on how the mandate will be exercised and whether the House or the Minister will have any role in deciding how the money is to be invested. There must be a clear line of accountability to the House if we are to take a significant amount of taxpayer's money out of the system and give it to the NTMA or such a body to manage, so that we are clear that the money is being invested in the interests of the economy.</P>
      <P>If the Minister intends that this money should be invested along commercial lines, as if it were a commercially run private pension fund, I would not support it. There is a need to take a more flexible view and to consider the greater needs in terms of health care and nursing home care of older people in 25 years' time. There is also a need to consider the requirements of the economy generally. However, I will not oppose the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I understand the Bill is temporary pending the finalisation of the detailed legislation which will be introduced shortly. The essence of the Bill is that the Government has decided to provide resources to pre-fund part of the future costs of social welfare and public service pensions and has set aside 1% of gross national product annually for that purpose, commencing this year. In addition, funds from the Telecom Éireann flotation totalling £2.417 million will also be paid into this temporary fund, bringing the total to approximately £3 billion this year.</P>
      <P>I noted a subtle message from the Labour Party which I was pleased to hear. However, it shows a clear difference in philosophy between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party. I was particularly struck by Deputy McDowell's comment that he would oppose the permanent legislation, which is due shortly, if it attempted in any way to take money from the Exchequer, which is needed to fund services and benefit people this year, and set it aside to fund pensions in the long-term. I contrast this position with his party's actions in Government during the 1980s when it had no trouble doubling the national debt from £12 billion to £25 billion in a few years. It had no problem taking money from the pockets of future generations by building up a national debt which would have to be paid by them. This excessive expenditure was not economically justified at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The State spent approximately 70 years building up a £12 billion debt. In five short years, the then Government doubled it to £25 billion. It has been in that upper region since and we have been working hard to reduce it. The turning point, which led to this Bill, was the vision of funding future pensions rather than raiding the State's coffers and building up a debt which would have to be paid by future generations.</P>
      <P>Social partnership was established in 1987 and led to the improvements in the economy through the Government working with the social partners. It was unique in Ireland and led to the creation of strong annual budget surpluses with a low rate of inflation and growth at a consistently high level. It has allowed us to look to the future as we approach the end of the millennium and provide funds for future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> I have no concerns that money, which might be needed on an annual basis to service day to day activities, will be taken this year, next year or in the future from the Exchequer and set aside in this fund for pension entitlements. In the context of the £40 billion national development plan which was announced recently, there is no shortage of financial resources to make up the infrastructural deficit to which the Deputy referred. The problem is the country's ability in terms of the manpower and technical and physical resources available to it to spend all the money and to ensure the plan is fully implemented between now and 2006.</P>
    <P>For example, this year £4.2 billion is being provided to the Department of Health and Children for current and capital expenditure. This works out at approximately £12 million a day for health services. When the Government is providing that level of funding, it is outrageous that there are problems in the health services. More than enough money is being provided and the various agencies, health boards and hospitals and their administrators and staff should consider if they are getting maximum value for taxpayers' money in dealing with waiting lists and all the other problems in the health services at present. These problems are not due to lack of financial resources but a lack of good procedures to ensure value for money.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who brought forward this proposal almost single-handedly. He is looking to the future; there are no votes in it in the short-term. It is appropriate for me to put down a marker at this time. If any party brings forward a policy in its manifesto in an effort to buy votes at the next general election that this fund should be raided on the basis that, because of the strength of the economy, the money in it could be put to better use, I will be quick to highlight its hypocrisy and the short sighted nature of such an approach.</P>
    <P>Many matters will arise during the debate and I ask the Minister to consider a number of them. Some of them could be addressed in the context of this Bill and others could be dealt with in the permanent legislation when it is introduced shortly. It is important to spell out certain matters for the public. Different phrases are interchanged but the Bill refers to 1% of gross national product. However, the Department of Finance often refers to gross domestic product. There is a significant difference between the two depending on which figure one uses. It is important that the public is clear about what is involved because Ireland has traditionally used GNP but there are slightly different definitions at European level. The public must be clear about the definition being used.</P>
    <P>I praise the role of the National Treasury Management Agency over the years. It is an excellent institution and I hope it will be to the forefront in managing the two new funds for public service and social welfare pensions. The agency has built up considerable expertise and it would be folly to <Col N="1314" /> set up a parallel body to substantially do the same work. I have every confidence in the agency's ability to do the job and that it will have proper democratic accounting procedures through the Minister for Finance and annual reports to the House.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the issue of the pensions of retired civil servants is being addressed because it has led to problems in recent years. Despite the strong economy, attempts have been made not to pass on the full benefits of agreed productivity deals or altered working arrangements in public sector areas to retired public servants. This practice is intrinsically unfair, particularly when the economy is doing well. The setting aside of the pension fund for the long-term will obviate the need to take that route and this is a welcome bonus.</P>
    <P>When pensions are mentioned, people think of the voluntary contributions they make through their employment. This aspect may arise in the Bill because it is most relevant. Many people who are paying into a pension fund to ensure they have extra income when they retire are concerned that this money will put them over the limit and mean they will not qualify for a State pension, a medical card or other similar benefits. People who set aside some income to look after themselves in their old age should receive some reward. They should not be penalised in terms of not being eligible for various State services.</P>
    <P>The level of inflation is historically low and although it may appear strange, I can envisage a situation where there could be deflation. There has been much inflation throughout this century but given the success of the economy, the level of exchange rates and the increasing ability of the world, due to new technology, to produce items at substantially lower costs than heretofore, it is possible that there may be deflation in the future. I do not mean there will be a depressed economy. It could be a positive state because of efficiency in production methods and prices may become lower. The possibility of deflation should be factored into the legislation.</P>
    <P>An actuarial report should be presented to the Dáil on the management of the fund at least every three years. It is vital that the projections underpinning this legislation are examined and reviewed on a regular basis to see whether the assumptions have held up in reality. If we look at the projections of many economists from institutes or Departments five, ten or 15 years ago and see what was projected for the end of the century, none bears any reality to the actual outturn. If reviewed on a regular basis this would allow us the opportunity to place sufficient funds in the temporary holding fund.</P>
    <P>This is only partial funding of pensions for the future. There is no question of this generation funding entirely the pensions for future generations. Not only are we meeting the costs of current pensions we will also make a partial provision for future generations who will have to meet the balance of the costs from their own resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> A question I would like to have answered in the legislation, either now or when we get the permanent legislation, is when this will kick into place? In other words, in what year will the temporary holding fund start to pay out social welfare and public service pensions? Will it be next year or in 20 years? When it comes into being it will have a major impact on the current budget deficit and the amount the Government will have to provide in the Estimates each year for the provision of public service pensions. The sooner the fund kicks into place, the sooner the country will witness an additional benefit in current expenditure in terms of the Estimates. I respectfully suggest, given that the economy is strong, we put off the draw-down date as much as possible. If we do not have to do so in the short-term we should wait as long as possible.</P>
    <P>The management of the fund is the most important practical aspect. There are two ways of looking at it. One may say that because it is a Government and public sector fund it should not be run on a strictly commercial basis. There will always be a temptation to insist that it be invested in Ireland or in the EU, perhaps to the detriment of the fund to earn a higher return if invested elsewhere. There is a balance to be struck and I do not think there is any definitive answer. The agency which will manage the fund will have to have a commercial mandate and work in accordance with Government policy of the day. I do not think it can be strictly commercial because too much of the funds might leave the country. However, there must be sufficient independence to ensure the Government of the day cannot direct it to invest its funds for a particular purpose to suit Government policy. The detailed legislation will address the balance that has to be struck.</P>
    <P>I avail of this opportunity to compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation. No other Minister for Finance would have thought of doing something like this. There are no votes in it for the next election but future generations will thank us for providing the funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the title of the Bill indicates this is a temporary holding fund. Many of the questions raised by Deputies relate to the substantial legislation which will be introduced next year. It is my intention to have the legislation published and, if possible, enacted by Easter. The questions raised relate to the policy options and what we will be done in all these areas. I will try to give the House some idea of my thinking on some of those areas. When I announced the fund in July I gave a press conference at which I dealt with some of them. I dealt with them also in subsequent interviews and at Question Time on one occasion &ndash; although not to any great extent but it was touched upon by a question tabled by Deputy Noonan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interjection with Deputy Noonan I pointed out that the full legislation will provide <Col N="1316" /> for two funds &ndash; the State pensioners' fund and the civil servants' fund. The thinking behind the July document was that the ratio would be 2:1. In regard to that document it should be noted that even on our estimations and even with a good start with the Telecom Éireann flotation, plus the 1% of GNP, it will go nowhere near meeting the full liabilities of this fund in time. We estimate that we would need to contribute about 3.5% of GNP to fund it fully. It must be borne in mind, as pointed out by Deputy Fleming, that even with giving the fund a good start it cannot be addressed fully in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised questions about the article in the <i>Financial Times</i>. That article refers to pensions being linked to inflation whereas our projections are based on pensions being linked to wage rises. The pensions now cost about 4% of GNP but with extra wages the costs will rise to over 9% of GNP by 2050. The indexed prices and the costs will fall to 4% as indicated in the <i>Financial Times</i> article. We are talking about two different things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I often ask that question. Deputies Noonan and McDowell asked what would happen with regard to the social insurance fund. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will introduce legislation to set up a training fund and Deputies will have an opportunity to contribute on that matter. A matter for consideration is what is to be done with the element of the social insurance fund which is being built up from potential contributions in the PRSI contribution. I am debating that matter and we will put forward the options before the legislation is finalised.</P>
      <P>Many questions were asked about the investment mandate, whether it will be equities, at home or abroad and Deputy Noonan asked about macroeconomic policy. I want to ensure that no subsequent Minister for Finance can dip his hand into this fund to help him get over a particular problem while at the same time ensuring full accountability to the House, because people's money is being put aside. We are trying to ensure that the moneys invested are in a fund and managed prudently and properly and not subject to the whims of Ministers for Finance or changes of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment mandate I would give to the fund would be to get the best return possible. Deputies Fleming and McDowell said a balance must be struck. The few funds that exist are not constrained by political considerations nor should they be. I do not know whether Deputy McDowell or Deputy Noonan have private pension arrangements but, if so, they would not be impressed if the manager or trustees of their funds took it upon themselves every few months to change policy, just because the Government of the day ordered it to do something. They would <Col N="1317" /> expect a maximum return from the fund over its lifetime. That is my thinking at this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and others asked why this money could not be used on infrastructure. The national development plan for infrastructure is funded by the Exchequer, the EU and public private partnerships and is what the economy can bear. There is no need to resort to this fund. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael is moving this Private <Col N="1318" /> Members' motion tonight because the Taoiseach and the Government have recklessly jeopardised social partnership in three ways, the first of which is by introducing one of the most unfair and divisive budgets ever seen in this House which neglected the needs of low paid workers and spuriously differentiated between different forms of work. The budget is unfair because it makes a family on £10,000 a year just £4 per week better off and a family on £50,000 a year £50 a week better off.</P>
      <P>Second, the budget was undermined by stealth from within the Government. As a result, the Government has resorted to the use of sticking plaster solutions to deal with the public outrage which the budget generated originally. In orchestrating this unravelling of the budget from within, the Taoiseach demonstrated a degree of contempt for the work of the Minister for Finance which shows he has no confidence in him.</P>
      <P>Third, the Government has jeopardised social partnership by making new spending commitments, which have already added an additional £250 million pounds to the figures announced on budget day, and by making further and to date unspecified promises in the form of nods and winks to different groups. In this way the Government has effectively abandoned the basis on which the fiscal plans for the year 2000 were so recently presented to the House.</P>
      <P>This is no way to create or maintain social partnership. Social partnership requires confidence. It requires a sense that those who are being paid to be in charge of the nation's affairs are actually in charge of them, have a sense of where they are going and have sufficient belief in what they are doing that, having made the decision, they can adhere to it. Prior to that, however, it requires that they make a decision which is fundamentally fair and takes account of the needs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth, which this budget shows, is that the Government has lost its political touch. It is a Government which is unable to understand fully the consequences of the actions it takes. It is quite surprising that this should happen in the third budget of a Government. One might expect errors of this nature and magnitude in the first budget of a Government by Ministers who had no experience or knowledge of the consequences of decisions or of the workings of public administration, yet it is in its third budget that the Government has plumbed the depths of incompetence in preparing the budget. No hyperbole would be an exaggeration of the folly of presenting a budget which has had to be amended so quickly after it was presented by the very people who introduced it. That creates a sense in the public mind that the people who are increasingly being paid good salaries as Ministers are not actually up to the job. The role of a politician in public administration is to understand public opinion and to ensure that what is produced administratively is acceptable and tolerable to public opinion. That is the role of the politician as distinct from the role of the economist or the <Col N="1319" /> Secretary General. It is a political failure which has led to this budget. It is fair to say, even though it is harsh, that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance are political failures in the way in which they handled this budget. They have shown that they are out of touch, unable to understand the consequences of what they are doing and, above all, and this is what makes it quintessentially a political failure, do not understand public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has publicised the fact that he does a bit of recreational running from time to time but he has never had to run as fast as he has had to run in the past week to catch up with the problems he has created for himself by his unbalanced, unfair and continuously unravelling budget. The news that a further £125 million is to be spent on social welfare will help some people on low incomes, but the Government could have achieved a much better result if it had taken Fine Gael's advice and exempted all taxpayers under £170 a week from income tax.</P>
    <P>Patching up the budget by instalments damages the credibility of the Government. It damages confidence in the budgetary process and invites further pressure from other groups. How is one to explain to the handicapped, to low income farmers and to those deprived of medical cards that there is no money for them when the Minister for Finance is so visibly giving in to one demand after another once it is made with eloquence from the Leinster House plinth? Inevitably, any package the Government now provides is bound to be full of anomalies.</P>
    <P>It is women at work who have been most deeply betrayed by this budget. Women make up three quarters of those who are paid below the minimum wage of £170 a week. We want to exempt all those at or below the minimum wage from tax and this Fine Gael plan would disproportionately benefit women at work. In the context of the resources available to it, it is a disgrace that, whereas Fine Gael was providing for an exemption from income tax of wages up to £170 per week, the Government only increased the exemption from £100 to a mere £110 per week. In the Fine Gael draft budget we also provided £25 per week for the mothers of children under the age of five, specifically to meet the child care costs of all women. In contrast the Government's increase in child benefit was a paltry £2 per week.</P>
    <P>My party and I strongly support social partnership, but it is not possible to build a true social partnership on a foundation which devalues the work of the low paid by giving radically larger concessions to the better off. This budget does ten times as much for the three car, three holiday family as it does for the average middle or lower income family, whether that be a single income or a double income family. That unfairness does not help social partnership.</P>
    <P>I have explained to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation the depth of Fine Gael's objection <Col N="1320" /> to the fundamental alteration of the tax system on the basis of which the current Administration is now attempting to negotiate a social partnership agreement. I know that both organisations respect the right of Dáil Éireann to change tax policy and it is important, therefore, that in their negotiations they should take into account the different approach to tax policy which Fine Gael, as a potential part of an alternative Administration, would pursue. It is important that employer and trade union leaders should take account of the risks in any agreement, if the assumptions of that agreement are based on a tax system for which there is not a tolerable measure of support in Dáil Éireann. A manufactured industrial relations consensus, which does not rest on a genuine social and political consensus, cannot stand. There is no genuine, social or political consensus around the budget. That is the flaw at the heart of current attempts to negotiate social partnership. The Government's proposals with regard to spouses working in the home have been well discussed already. A constitutional action is a certainty. It is not good for the country that a key element of the Government's tax policy should be the subject of such deep constitutional doubt, as is this year's budget. Ireland has been a success in economic terms precisely because our tax policies have been predictable and based on consensus and partnership. A potentially unconstitutional income tax policy is, by its nature, deeply uncertain. Its survival will depend on the uncertain outcome of a Supreme Court case.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been able to get investment from overseas because we have provided certainty in regard to our tax code. By introducing a deep-seated constitutional uncertainty into our personal income tax, which must be collected under PAYE by businesses, the Government is creating a wholly unnecessary uncertainty that will be very bad for economic development and social partnership.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for Ireland's economic success is that Government and Opposition &ndash; when they alternate in Government &ndash; have been able to pursue tax policies that are consistent with one another and which represent an organic development of what has gone before. While major differences in priority have been given to concessions in particular parts of the tax code between Government and Opposition as they alternate, the system of taxation itself has always been one on which, up to now, there was a tolerable degree of cross-party consensus.</P>
    <P>Let me say clearly to the Taoiseach and his Government that there is now no consensus between Government and Opposition on the fundamental approach in this budget to the income tax system and the way it treats families. Fine Gael will do everything it can to put right the divisive restructuring of the tax system still contained in the budget. We will not rest until equality between families is restored. Since no one would wish to take away benefits already given to two-income families, any equalisation to <Col N="1321" /> restore equity to single-income families will require extra resources.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret having to say this because I know that a measure of consensus between Government and Opposition is helpful to social partnership. There can be no consensus, however, between my party and Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats on the basis of the fundamentally unjust policies contained in the budget. The Government parties have attempted to divide women between those at work and those at home, and between those with young children and those whose children have been reared. This is part of a manipulative political culture which sees voters as categories to be exploited for political gain.</P>
    <P>There is in reality no conflict of interest between either category of women, nor should there be. By its budgetary strategy, however, the Government has set out to create such a conflict and, in part, it is succeeding. On the other hand, social partnership at its most profound level includes partnership between men and women, between those at work and those at home, and between those on low incomes and those on higher incomes. The budget contains no underlying concept of partnership on those issues.</P>
    <P>In the budget they have introduced, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have breached the fundamental foundation of partnership in a profound way. By moving this motion, Fine Gael is seeking to start the process of putting this right. Fine Gael will continue to promote its own policies on taxation, which are fair and just. We will oppose this unravelling budget every day between now and the passage of the Final Stage of the Finance Bill. Throughout the Finance Bill we will table amendments to reverse the unfair and divisive character of the budget. We will discuss these amendments with the Independent Deputies, some of whom have already expressed deep-seated unease and concern about the budget.</P>
    <P>In the unlikely event that the Government manages to translate its Finance Bill into a Finance Act, Fine Gael, on returning to Government &ndash; while maintaining the <i>de facto</i> position at the time, which may have been achieved by double-income families &ndash; will restore equity of treatment between families by the use of extra resources as they become available.</P>
    <P>We do not believe it was necessary for the Government to be so divisive in the way it drafted this budget. Prior to the budget, Fine Gael published its own proposals whereby the extra cost of going out to work, borne particularly by women, could have been met by an increase in the PAYE allowance. Fine Gael also showed how it would be possible to take people who are currently paying the top rate of tax &ndash; and who should not be doing so &ndash; out of the top rate by increasing allowances and bands, and by introducing a 35% medium band. There are alternative ways of achieving what the Government sought, without creating the division and deep sense of hurt felt <Col N="1322" /> by those on low incomes. The latter group feels it has been ignored and that has created much difficulty for social partnership. In the most profound sense, the Government has shown itself to be politically unwise and out of touch in the budget it introduced. We hope a Government that can make such a mistake will not endure for too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>A group of strangers visiting Ireland at the moment would find it hard to follow what is actually happening. They probably would have been briefed by the IDA to suggest that social partnership was the bedrock on which our economic policy was founded. During their visit they would find the representatives of organised labour, business, the farming community and voluntary groups who form the fourth pillar in the partnership talks were all agreed that a new social partnership was desirable and that they would bend might and mane to negotiate a new agreement.</P>
      <P>They would come to the Parliament and would find that the Opposition parties were totally committed to partnership. They probably would not be too surprised at that because they would quickly learn that the present partnership arrangement, Partnership 2000, was negotiated by the Opposition when in Government &ndash; principally by the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>However, they would be amazed that the Government, which would claim that social partnership was the bedrock of its economic policy, could not have done better to undermine it if it had set out to do so. The budget has undermined social partnership, not only because of the elements of the budget itself, but also because of the manner in which the retreat from Dunkirk was organised and executed, and principally by the philosophical or ideological base on which the budget was founded.</P>
      <P>We are left with a situation where the partners &ndash; who, I hope, will negotiate the next agreement &ndash; like the country at large, have no confidence in the Minister for Finance or his colleagues in the Cabinet. Members of the Cabinet seem to be able to absolve themselves of blame by saying that on the one hand they were not consulted at all or, on the other hand, they were consulted but they said that this would never work. Twelve Cabinet members are running from the noise of battle, blaming their Taoiseach, their Tánaiste and their Minister for Finance. This is a Cabinet which is supposed to be operating on the constitutional principle of collective responsibility, yet its members are running in all directions. Is it any wonder that the putative strangers visiting our shores would find that the Cabinet is totally out of touch with what is going on and is another group of people who are undermining social partnership. They certainly would have no confidence in the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Saturday, I have read articles by distinguished journalists in numerous newspapers <Col N="1323" /> suggesting that the resources of the Fianna Fáil Party, of which the Taoiseach is president, were systematically used to organise Government Deputies on the plinth of Leinster House to give interviews to undermine the Government's own budget. That has not been contradicted in public by either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely outrageous that the Taoiseach of the day should undermine the budget put forward by his own Minister for Finance for some devious, cunning or tactical political reasons. I believe it is actually unconstitutional. The Taoiseach would be following the path of the late President Nixon at this stage if we had such procedures in this House and if we had a more rigorous democracy in this country. It defies belief that a Taoiseach would set about systematically undermining his Government's budget.</P>
      <P>The strangers visiting our shores would have a very peculiar view of how the country is organised and managed by the Government. They might not be too surprised, however, when they read the budget. This was an ideological budget, drawn up by a number of politicians who were frustrated in the 1980s when Mrs. Thatcher's conservatism and economic management were in vogue. In a kind of revisiting of the past, they have now imposed a 1980s conservative English budget on the Irish electorate.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Thatcher is infamously reputed to have said there is no such thing as society. Those who drew up this budget have a similar idea that there is not really a society, that Ireland is not organised into family units, that communities do not really matter, whether in the cities or small rural communities, that the basis of society, if it exists at all, is simply a series of individuals and the management of a country is the management of the future of individuals making free choices in a free market. In this view, everybody is either &ldquo;economic man&rdquo; or &ldquo;economic woman&rdquo; and one caters for their economic needs, blows the whistle, lets the race commence and there are no other consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with that theory is that one cannot believe in it and in social partnership at the same time. It is not possible to have the two concepts in one's head. It is not possible to run a Government on such diverse principles. The idea of partnership is that there is such a thing as society and that people who are opposed in the workplace, such as employers and unions, come together and compromise for the good of the country, their members, families and society as a whole. That essential nature of partnership has been totally forgotten by the people who organised this budget. It is no wonder that, as the budget was seen to fail, partnership also cracked. <Col N="1324" /> It is not possible to build partnership on this budget.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary decision to ignore the needs of low paid persons in the budget was socially unjust. From a negotiating point of view, it was extraordinarily short-sighted. Anyone approaching partnership talks this year would have known that the introduction of the minimum wage in April would create a new benchmark. It was quite clear there was going to be a demand to exempt the minimum wage from income tax. It was also quite clear that if there was not a statement of intent to make significant progress towards that in the budget, the unions' response would be to look for a higher minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The unions' position is quite clear and is driven by the needs of their low paid members &ndash; if they are not going to get it in tax breaks they will have to get it in higher nominal wages. Everybody knows that is the negotiating position. One does not need to have been involved in social partnership talks in the past to work that out. It is also crystal clear that IBEC will strongly resist an increase of the minimum wage before it is introduced. It was quite foreseeable that the decision to move the exemption limit on income tax only from £100 to £110 would wreck social partnership and make it extremely difficult to deliver a deal because there would be an immediate demand for a higher minimum wage and, as a consequence, the trade union movement and IBEC would be thrown into unnecessary conflict.</P>
    <P>That is the current position. We saw what happened when the leaders of SIPTU withdrew from the talks on the low pay issue. They were left in an impossible position by the Government. The Taoiseach, if we are to believe the profiles we read of him, regards his skill in negotiating partnership deals as his forte among all his portfolio skills. I cannot understand why he went with a minimum increase of the level of wages at which one enters the tax net when the consequences were so foreseeable.</P>
    <P>As Deputy John Bruton pointed out, Fine Gael is committed to exempting the minimum wage in its totality from income tax. We know what that will cost. When I costed an increase from £100 to £170 with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance at the end of September, it came to £1.1 billion. That is a lot of money. Many people think that when one talks about exempting the first £170 of income from tax it only applies to people earning £170 a week but, of course, it applies to all income. I presume the removal of £10 has brought it down to £1 billion, or so. There is a big price to be paid and the same money cannot be spent twice. Once the money is spent, one must decide what one is going to do for the future.</P>
    <P>The second issue which I want to address is individualisation. In the tax policy proposed by Fine Gael, we recognised that there are different costs where two people in the same house, rather than one, go out to work. We said that, in some way, the PAYE allowance already reflects that <Col N="1325" /> difference. However, the PAYE allowance is no longer sufficient, especially with the changes that were made to it last year by applying it at the standard rate only, which had the effect of reducing it. We proposed that the PAYE allowance should be increased to £3,600. That would have been an effective margin.</P>
    <P>I cannot see where the Minister's proposals on individualisation originated, unless they came from the former Deputy McDowell, who is now the Attorney General. He is the only one I remember making any argument about individualisation during various financial debates in this House over the years. The Minister, defending his budget on the night it was announced, and, subsequently, the Taoiseach claimed they were basing their proposals on Tim Callan's article in the ESRI report published on 27 September. However, I read that article and what Mr. Callan and his friends said is not what was done in the budget. Mr. Callan took the opportunity to write an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, saying that, wherever the Government got the notion, it did not get it from him and he was not going to take the blame for it. I do not know where it came from &ndash; it seems to have come out of a clear blue sky &ndash; but it was certainly a very bad idea.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we all recognise that some differential is necessary between people who go out to work and those who do not, simply because it is more expensive. That could be reflected in the PAYE allowance. The gap in allowances in the first year between £28,000 and £34,000 might be bad &ndash; it is about £1,320 in terms of cash in hand &ndash; but when it is taken forward to the third year the gap is between £28,000 and £56,000. In very simple terms, a family with one income enters the higher rate of tax when its income passes £28,000 but a family with two earners does not enter the higher rate of tax until its income passes £56,000. That level of gap is not defensible, sustainable or explicable. It is no wonder the telephones were hot in Leinster House, with all of us getting calls from spouses who were seriously upset that their contribution to their homes and families by their decision to stay at home had been diminished to such a degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. I have just come from a function and I remain amazed by the number of ordinary people who are still incensed by this budget. One would think it was politically contrived or some form of political opportunism, but people outside are far more apoplectic about the budget than Members of the House who are rational in debating and dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach to economic policy is in tatters. This budget hit a raw nerve of divisiveness between families on the same income and the same expenses but who are being treated differently, between spouses at home and spouses at work and between spouses in the home with children and spouses in the home with no children. With every move the Government makes <Col N="1326" /> people work out how their contribution has been valued. It is like playing pinball &ndash; the Government rolls the ball and decides that it will look at individualisation again and it might not last three years. Then the Government hits a red light and decides to introduce a £3,000 tax allowance. It then hits a green light and someone decides to do something about low pay, resulting in a package on FIS, qualifying adult allowances and so on. Then someone else decides to do something about child benefit. However, we know that the ball will end up down a black hole at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>No budget has ever given away so much money, yet none has been so systematically undermined by Government backbenchers and been treated with such derision. An employer can give an employee £10 for a drink and he would be delighted, but could give someone else £50 and insult them. This Government seems incapable of managing expectations or explaining its philosophy to ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael outlined its tax proposals last September, long before a successor to Partnership 2000 was discussed. The package was worth £2 billion and was criticised for being overly generous, but we stated that it would have to be implemented over two or three budgets. Great credit is due to Deputy Noonan for his imagination, flair and leadership on this issue. We said that 200,000 people had to be taken out of the tax net which would mean raising the limits, not just on exemptions, but on the basic personal tax free allowance of £170 per week. All income is now reckonable for tax purposes, including social welfare payments, and our proposal is equitable, just and fair.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about women at work, the majority of whom work part-time. About 20,000 women work between one and nine hours per week and 60,000 work between ten and 19 hours per week. These women are preponderantly on low pay. Shops everywhere are advertising for part-time and full-time staff and I cannot understand why no one in the Government concluded that the key issue in terms of moving people from welfare to work is that gross pay should be the same as net pay for low paid workers. That is what is required to get people into employment, to fill the vacancies and to ensure equity. No one will work for less than £5 per hour, therefore, how can one take £35 in tax from a weekly pay packet of £180 or £190?</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the issue of the changes made to meet the ire and the wrath exposed. Due to individualisation, the concession for double income families is £1,300. The value of the stay-at-home spouse is £660 &ndash; they are worth only half under the Government's proposals, which are being made up as we go along. However, the 30,000 spouses in the home, many of whom are in their fifties and have spent years rearing the cubs of the Celtic tiger, are now valueless &ndash; they are worth nothing. Their parents are probably <Col N="1327" /> deceased and they have been relegated to the Vauxhall Conference.</P>
    <P>As well as the basic provisions on low pay, the jewel in the crown of Fine Gael's proposals was the provision that top income earners should pay a top rate of tax and that is it not unreasonable for someone on a very high income to pay 46p in the pound. We need to introduce a new middle rate of 35% for £50,000 earners and double that for double income families, under the Murphy case. This would ensure that moderate income earners pay moderate tax rates and would deal with the position where a single person used to pay the top rate on £14,100 per year. This proposal is a more intelligent way of dealing with middle income families and would have been more attractive to people who are in the position where one spouse is using all the tax allowances and they wonder what tax they will pay if the second spouse takes a job. Such people would pay tax at 35%.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's basic proposal for an earned income credit would have introduced far more equity to the system and would have ensured the extension of the standard rate band to take 160,000 taxpayers off the top rate. However, the money used to reduce the top rate and to bring so many people to the standard rate has been frittered away in meeting that objective.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has always tried to create the impression that Fine Gael is opposed to partnership. It conveniently forgets that we are the authors of Partnership 2000 and that it inherited the economic success we laid for it. We have had over a decade agreements &ndash; Programme for National Recovery, PESP, PCW and Partnership 2000. These partnerships arrangements have worked on the basic premise that Ireland will become more competitive by trading off moderate pay increases for large net take home pay, based on the combined tax reduction approach. In so doing one increases net pay, improves competitiveness and sustains a massive growth in the workforce. Fine Gael favours the continuation of this policy. We launched our proposal when there was no general election in sight and it was designed to create a context and a basis for a successful conclusion to another partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>Public sector pay is the second issue which needs to be addressed and which can only be dealt with by a partnership deal. We have an early 1970s formula for relativities which bedevils issues like nurses' pay, linkages to prison officers' pay and so on. We must have a merit-based society and a merit-based system for increasing pay, related to further qualifications and new technology in the public service. This would ensure that those who are earning and worth more would be paid more, as happens in the private sector.</P>
    <P>This is the most divisive budget ever. It is unprecedented in its thoughtlessness and has humiliated and insulted women, many of whom <Col N="1328" /> are at work and aspire to starting a family and raising children. The budget has done nothing for the supply side of child care by way of capitation and many creches have closed under this Government because of bureaucratic red tape. There are many other opportunities offered by partnership to deal with hospital waiting lists and to have a Minister for Education, rather than a Minister for teachers, who would deal with the real issues of remedial education and equality of opportunity for young people leaving school.</P>
    <P>However, all of this is caught up in a conundrum of Ministers briefing against Ministers. We are told that this is all good news because the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's leadership prospects have been terminated. However, these issues are too serious. The Government can run on auto-pilot and the economy will continue to grow for the rest of its short life. However, we need to sustain the boom for the next decade which will require, not an auto-pilot, but leadership, enhanced competitiveness and, most of all, fair play and straight dealing. This Government has used its smoke-filled rooms to deceive and cheat and in a most divisive way has put woman against woman and workers against those who stay at home. This is a turning point in the lifetime of this Government. It is, in effect, the beginning of the end.</P>

      <P>&ndash;conscious of the Government's determination to continue to reform the taxation system to ensure that as many low paid workers as possible are taken out of the system altogether, and to remove middle income earners from the top rate of tax; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the Government's decision to introduce a national hourly minimum wage from 1 April 2000,</P>

    <P>For the past 12 years, social partnership has played a crucial role in shaping our economic development. It has done so by supporting a competitive evolution of incomes which underpinned the transformation of the public finances and delivered low inflation. The consensus approach provided stability and confidence and facilitated high levels of investment and jobs growth. Through its inclusive structure, social partnership has supported an ambitious approach to social policy, especially the tackling of unemployment. With the <i>Programme for National Recovery   </i> in 1987, social partnership was born. It was not easy but through sacrifice, compromise and discipline, the tide began slowly to turn. Irish people dared to hope again &ndash; for themselves, and for their children.</P>

      <P>A great deal of what the Deputy said does not stand up to scrutiny. Our achievements over 12 years of social partnership have been spectacular by any standards. The national debt-GNP ratio has dropped from a massive 125% to just over 50%, inflation during the partnership years has averaged a rate of only 2.8%, compared to an equivalent rate of 11.7% in the decade before, and the public finances have moved from a point of deep crisis to a level of buoyancy unprecedented in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly revealing to look at the position with regard to real take-home pay. Money wages increased by 21% a year in the ten years to 1988, but real take-home pay fell by 14% between 1980 and 1987. By contrast, since 1988, money wages have risen by 4.5% per year, but real take-home pay has increased by 35%. These statistics are impressive but the social and economic transformation of the last 12 years is most evident of all in the areas of employment and unemployment. There are half a million more people in work now than in 1987. The total number in employment is almost 1.6 million &ndash; the highest level ever in the history of this State. <Col N="1330" /> Who, at the outset of social partnership, could have predicted such progress?</P>
    <P>We live in a competitive world. We cannot be complacent. Our success depends on our ability to cope with the competitive challenges of the international marketplace and social partnership can give us the edge needed to cope with those challenges. Four partnership agreements have helped to bring us to prosperity and economic success &ndash; a fifth can help us to deepen and to share that success. This Government is strongly committed to the principle of partnership. We want to negotiate a new accord and we will make every effort to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of successive national agreements has been the creation of an inclusive society. This is an objective to which the present Government strongly subscribes and our record on this front is impressive by any standards. In the period since the Government took office, the number of people who are unemployed has fallen by 75,000, the unemployment rate has been halved and the level of long-term unemployment has fallen dramatically. In fact, the most recent quarterly national household survey shows that only 2.5% of the workforce is now classified as long-term unemployed, down from 5.5% in mid-1997.</P>
    <P>That is progress but we're not satisfied with it. We can now achieve the effective elimination of long-term unemployment within the lifetime of this administration and that is the target which we have set ourselves in the review of the programme for Government. It is an ambitious target but the sustained strength of the Irish economy means that we can now afford to be ambitious. The value of economic success will be lessened if there are still over 40,000 people effectively excluded from the advantages and opportunities offered by participation in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The Government has also worked hard to ensure that work is worthwhile. We have delivered significant increases in take-home pay by reducing substantially the burden of tax on all those who work for a living. The parties opposite talk a great game on tax reform.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity they did so little about it when they were in office. As I said to Deputy Yates, 24 points have been taken off the tax rates in the past ten years, 23 of them during the lifetime of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government. It is quite remarkable that the parties opposite did so little to move people on modest incomes out of the top-rate net and people on low incomes out of the tax net altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government took office two and a half years ago, a single person entered the tax net at just £77 a week. Two and a half years later we have brought that figure up to £110 a week, an increase of over 40%. When the Government took office a single person became liable for the <Col N="1331" /> top rate of tax at just £261 a week. We have now brought that figure up to £327 a week. When the Government took office a person on average industrial earnings faced a marginal tax rate of 48%. We have now brought that down to 22%. It is important to note that these tax reductions were not paid for by cuts in social services &ndash; quite the contrary. We have demonstrated in this country that when one improves incentives one can stimulate additional economic activity and generate resources for the Exchequer. One can reduce taxes and raise revenues. We have certainly proved the incentive power of low taxation.</P>
    <P>This has enabled us to invest enormous resources in developing our social services and improving state supports for the more vulnerable sections of Irish society.</P>

      <P>Nowhere has this been more evident than in our approach to older people. For years old age pensioners had to put up with miserable increases which did little or nothing to improve their standard of living. Over three budgets from 1995 to 1997, the rainbow Government increased the basic rate of the old age pension by a total of £7.</P>

      <P>We have a democratic mandate to deliver certain improvements in the tax system and they will be delivered. The resources are now becoming available to do much more. I will be bringing in the national minimum wage from 1 April 2000. In three years the rainbow Government only managed to increase the basic tax free allowance for a single person by a miserable £550. On that basis it would take almost 20 budgets to exempt the minimum wage from tax. I am confident we can do a lot better during the lifetime of this Government. The time to reform the tax system is when one is in Government, not in Opposition.</P>

The Labour Party increased rates by 1% on one occasion but they reduced it pretty quickly. Given that Opposition parties are against reducing tax rates, why do they not increase them when they get into Government?</P>

      <P>The major beneficiaries of that transformation will be the working people of Ireland, particularly the PAYE sector, whose acceptance of pay moderation in the early years of the partnership process paved the way to prosperity from which society and the economy has gained.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier of the first four partnership agreements, what they have brought us and where they have brought us, but what about the next agreement? What do we as a nation want it to achieve? Where do we as a nation want it to take us? Any new agreement must deliver responsible wage growth. Workers must benefit to the fullest possible extent from economic growth without compromising the competitive strength on which our prosperity is built. A new agreement must provide for gain-sharing in the workplace so that employees can benefit directly from the successful performance of the companies in which they work. Any new agreement must provide for a new approach to public sector pay determination, one that enables all those who work in the public service to share in the benefits accruing from change. Indeed, change and the management of change is likely to be one of the central features of any new partnership agreement. We live in a world which is changing at a breathtaking pace. We know that as much as 80% of technology will be replaced within ten years with new and better technologies. In the area of information technology software, the pace of change is even faster. In this environment modernisation is not an option, it is a necessity.</P>
      <P>We must think in terms of opportunities, not obstacles. New technology can be the key to further national prosperity but we must know how to use it. It is estimated that 80% of those who will be part of the labour force in ten years' time are already in the workplace. Some 80% of technologies may be new but 80% of skills may be old. That means, potentially, a huge skills gap and a significant challenge for trades unions, businesses and for Government. That is the kind of challenge which can best be met by continuing the process of partnership.</P>
      <P>I hope it is clear that I accept the important role that social partnership, together with other factors, including sound Government policies, have played in our economic success. This Government has honoured in full the terms of Partnership 2000. We did not negotiate that agreement but we recognised the importance of continuity and the value of the partnership process. Social partnership agreements have been seen as one of the competitive advantages of the Irish economy. Politicising the partnership process, by undermining confidence in the continuity of policy, is in no one's interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to say that social partnership has replaced politics far from it. This and every Government has a duty to implement the democratic mandate it receives from the people. Partnership and democracy are not mutually exclusive. One can only operate successfully within the <Col N="1335" /> framework of the other. This has been true in Ireland for the past 12 years and there is every reason to believe it will still be true for the next 12 years. No Government can abdicate its responsibilities or its prerogatives derived from the democratic process. The National Economic and Social Forum observed the following in an important report on the partnership process:</P>
    <P>In identifying the State's role in facilitating deliberation, information-pooling and action by other organisations, it is not implied that the State is neutral, or that it comes to issues without an agenda or interests of its own. The State is much more than a referee. Its democratic mandate and resources give it a unique role in the partnership process.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton, as Taoiseach, addressed the social partners on the opening of talks on Partnership 2000 in October 1996 by noting that the NESC and NESF had identified issues and made recommendations for a new programme. He went on to set down six priorities which his Government intended to pursue in discussions on a programme. Deputy De Rossa, as Minister for Social Welfare, told the Dáil in the same month that the NESC report brought valuable insights and that he would take the closest account of the council's views in developing social welfare policy &ndash; not that he would treat it as a holy writ.</P>
    <P>The value of the NESC and the NESF in shaping the agenda for a problem-solving approach to social partnership has derived, in large measure, from the open and non-adversarial way in which reports have been prepared. This has enabled the members to go beyond the narrow defence of their traditional positions in shaping a strategic framework for policy and partnership. Real social learning and subsequent leadership have flowed from this approach. Members were able to prepare agreed reports precisely because they had flexibility to go beyond the defence of sectoral interest, without formally committing their organisations. That came later in formal negotiations against the background of the shared analysis of the reports.</P>
    <P>The budget addressed one of the two core NESC recommendations on tax, namely, the relatively low incomes at which people enter the higher tax rate. The budget removed 125,000 people on modest incomes from the higher tax rate through the only means by which that can be done, as the NESC pointed out, widening the standard rate band. The budget also removed 72,000 people from the tax net altogether. The social welfare improvements represented the biggest package ever, with average rate increases of 5.5% reflecting the NESC approach to approximating increases to movements in average living standards. The dramatic improvements in funding for social housing and health care, especially for people with disabilities, are further evidence of a focus on social inclusion in line with NESC. One of the core priorities of the NESC <Col N="1336" /> was to make lifelong learning a reality. The dramatic improvements in education, more details of which will be announced by the Minister for Education and Science tomorrow, and the establishment of a national training fund, show that the Government's policy is in line with the NESC strategy.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that measures such as these breached either the spirit or thrust of partnership. I would make the general point that it is unrealistic to expect that all budgetary objectives can be addressed fully in just one budget. It is my firm belief that the budget achieved significant progress in the commitments my Government laid before the Irish people in our action programme and in the priorities identified by the social partners. Any problems are best resolved at the negotiating table. I believe that they can be resolved &ndash; I am convinced they will. In these negotiations, as both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have made clear, we will address the development of tax policies that reflect the NESC strategy, as well as the Government's tax policy objectives. The Government wants to hear the social partners' views. The best forum, indeed the only sensible forum, for that process is the negotiating table on a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations of the NESC was for a negotiated consensus that includes agreement on pay, tax reform, the public finances, infrastructure, housing and policies to address social exclusion. I find it hard to understand how anyone concerned about low pay could seriously suggest abandoning social partnership in favour of a pay free-for-all, with all that implies. When the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I met the social partners on 9 November, we outlined our support for implementing in a realistic and balanced manner the vision and strategy set out by NESC in the context of negotiating a new partnership agreement. The Taoiseach reaffirmed this commitment to the social partners last week. We want to see its vision and strategy progressed to fruition.</P>
    <P>In framing the recent budget, the Government took account of its policy programme and mandate and the NESC report. In due time, the value of measures taken in the budget will be recognised in a way that has been obscured by current controversy.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement came to the partnership table in the late 1980s, when times were hard and when it was recognised that things would have to get worse before they got better. All that has changed now. We have unprecedented resources available to us. We have problems &ndash; problems of inequality, marginalisation, exclusion and deprivation &ndash; but we have the wherewithal at our disposal to solve these problems together.</P>
    <P>I know that all the social partners want to play a part in shaping the future of this country as we move into a new decade and a new century. I extend an invitation to them to come and help us shape that future together.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago, on the eve of the budget, Government Ministers and backbenchers could hardly contain their excitement. The Minister for Finance stood poised to deliver his budget against the background of the most favourable economic circumstances in the history of the State. This would be, they assured everyone who was prepared to listen, the most popular budget in the history of the State. There would be something for everyone. Every sector would be looked after and nobody would be disappointed or even feel left out. Nobody could deliver an unpopular budget in these circumstances. This was the budget that would set up Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for re-election whenever the next general election might come. Can I say at this juncture that I propose to share my time, with the agreement of the House, with Deputy Rabbitte?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister concluded his speech on 1 December, the same backbenchers who either had not been listening or who had been taken in by their own pre-propoganda, or who failed to understand what Minister McCreevy said, cheered him to the rafters and rushed out to announce the good news to their constituents. Has there ever been a budget that has been so misjudged by a Government and its Deputies? Two weeks on, it is clear that the budget introduced by Minister McCreevy has been the most inept, ill-judged, socially divisive and unfair budget in the history of the State. The only competitor who comes close is Ernest Blythe.</P>
      <P>The principal victims of this budget have been the poor, those dependent on social welfare, those on low pay whose interests were virtually ignored by Minister McCreevy and those parents who choose to work in the home and who were told by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance that their interests simply do not rate with this Government. In case there is any misconception, I am referring to budget No. 1. Budget No. 2 has some references to people at home and budget No. 3 will have something else, but since this debate is confined to budget No. 1, I will refer to that.</P>
      <P>There have been other casualties in this budget No. 1, including the political reputations of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. The position of Minister McCreevy is simply without precedent in Irish politics. He grossly misjudged the mood of the country, the trade union movement, the Dáil and even his own party, as the procession of penitents to the plinth clearly manifested. He introduced a budget that he was incapable of getting through the House.</P>

      <P>He did not. It has not yet been voted upon.

The Dáil finds itself in the ludicrous situation of having to spend a week debating a budget, budget No. 1, that no longer applies because we are now dealing with budget No. 2 and we are promised budget No. 3. We are resuming debate tonight on a budget that we know will be changed yet again. Quite frankly, in any other country, a Minister for Finance who so misjudged the situation and who was responsible for creating this fiasco would have long ago resigned in shame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason he will not do that, and why he is still in office, is that the Taoiseach shares the blame for this botched budget and the attempts by him to distance himself from his Minister for Finance, not for the first time, simply will not wash. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were clearly aware of the budget provisions and would have been required, even under this coalition Government structure, to give their stamp of approval to them.</P>
      <P>Anyone who knows anything about the political record of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy will not be surprised that he would attempt to introduce such a regressive, discriminatory and simply unfair budget. From my analysis, at every point in his political career, when Deputy McCreevy had the choice of assisting the poor or featherbedding the well off, he has always chosen to back the rich. As Minister for Social Welfare, he cut a swathe of destruction through the social welfare system with his infamous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts. In his first budget he introduced a package that shamelessly backed the well off by cutting the upper rate of tax and a series of other measures, including the halving of capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we now to make of this carefully crafted reputation? It is a fraud. The fact is that his reputation is in tatters. He approved a budget that was designed to benefit the bottom 10% of earners in this Republic by just 0.7% but which benefited the top 30% by a margin of between 3.7% and 4.4%. He approved a budget that improved the position of a family with two children earning £10,000 per year by just £2.15 per week &ndash; dare I say it, not even the price of a pint of Bass &ndash; while a similar family earning £40,000 per year would benefit by up to £43 per week.</P>
      <P>The advent of information technology means that the implications of any of these possible alternatives, variations or decisions instantly factor onto the table of decision makers, so ignorance cannot be pleaded by the people who made these decisions. This was no mistake. This was a deliberate, socially divisive ideological choice that was made by this triumvirate, if I can be marginally sexist, of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance approved a budget that told the majority of those on social welfare that, despite our unprecedented economic success, the best he can do for them is an extra £4 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and others will point in absolute <Col N="1340" /> terms to the substantial increase that has occurred between this year and last year and previous years, but let me put the other side of that numerical equation on the table. When I succeeded the then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, as Minister for Finance, there was an unexpected surplus of £15 million in the current account in this month five years ago. Revenue had exceeded that of expenditure in the current account by £15 million. This year, going into the year 2000, the projected current budget surplus is £4,850 million. On top of that there is a pension fund provision of approximately £4 billion, and there are contingency sums of the order of £175 million or £180 million over the next three years. To compare the kind of increases that are trumpeted as being wonderfully substantial in terms of overall money simply ignores the totally different standpoint from which this budget could have been constructed as it was just over five years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The series of inspired newspaper stories over the weekend suggesting a rift between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and of the Minister being called to heel by the Taoiseach was a clear attempt to distance the Taoiseach from this fiasco. Of course, the Taoiseach is publicly backing the Minister for Finance, which is the very time the Minister needs to watch out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ellis found that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ellis found that out but prior to that not only did the Taoiseach back Deputy Albert Reynolds for the Fianna Fáil nomination for the Presidency, he even showed him his vote. I hope he does not have to show the Minister for Finance his vote in the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>One of the most serious effects of this budget has been the damage it has done to the spirit of social partnership which has undoubtedly served the economic interests of this country for 12 years. In one fell swoop, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have done more damage to social partnership than excessive wage demands or employer greed. It was always clear that if there was going to be a new agreement, it would have to be very different from those which had gone before it. There was widespread acceptance that an agreement, negotiated in conditions of unprecedented economic success, would have to be very different from those agreed when the economy was on its knees. Everyone knew there would be difficulties negotiating a successor to Partnership 2000 but this budget has made that task immeasurably more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the talks are in crisis and that the largest and most representative trade union has withdrawn from them is that the unions believe they have been misled and betrayed by the <Col N="1341" /> Government, in general, and the Taoiseach, in particular.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They believed the Government was committed to the general approach and strategy set out in the recent NESC report, Opportunities, Challenges, Capacities for Choice, and particularly the key recommendation that incomes tax cuts should focus on the lower paid. They had every reason for so believing. The Taoiseach said in the House on 17 November: &ldquo;I generally accept what is in the report.&rdquo;  The unions and the social partners believed the Taoiseach when he said after the meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party in Galway last September that reducing the top rate of tax would not be a priority in the budget and they believed there was a general consensus between the Government and the social partners on the way to proceed.</P>

      <P>The Government proceeded to smash the consensus which had been carefully built up by introducing a budget which was in direct conflict with the strategy outlined in the NESC report and the understandings at which the trade unions believed they had arrived.</P>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not take a stand against the McCreevy-Harney axis which was clearly allowed to dictate economic policy in the run up to the budget? Why did the Taoiseach allow the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to insist on reducing the upper rate of tax at a cost of £156 million when this money could have funded an extra £12 to £15 in child benefit giving a total increase &ndash; I am sure the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs would have been in favour of this &ndash; of between £20 and £25 per month. The reason those choices were not made and that this was a purely ideologically driven decision that no representative group, not even IBEC, had sought&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It gets worse. Did the Taoiseach not balk at the proposed changes to capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax? Did he not recall the reaction to the CGT changes in the Minister's first budget? Does he not think it unfair that the highest tax rates in the Irish system apply to labour and labour only? As an accountant, he must be aware of the excitement being caused in accountancy circles about the changes to the application of CAT with respect to residence and domicile &ndash; Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach are no strangers to attempts to muddy the waters in respect of residence and domicile. I advise the two Ministers present, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to watch with a magnifying glass the small print which will appear in the draft of the Finance Bill <Col N="1342" /> because there is a raid of unprecedented proportions being connived and hatched as we sit innocently here before Christmas. I say it to them in all solidarity that this is not the first time these requests have been made. The confusion in the wording and the ambiguity in the wording of the Minister for Finance's speech, which is all we have to go on, signals to some of us who have some experience in these matters that there is something much more substantial being contemplated.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy McDowell, described this budget as immoral. His words are true and I agree with them. Commentators in Irish politics have for some time talked about all-party consensus on issues. The extent of the consensus coincides with a shared belief across the House in social partnership. However, let us not confuse consensus with partnership; let us not confuse a willingness for two different points of view to compromise with some overall consensus. I always held the view that the extent of that consensus has been exaggerated. For example, my party's proposals for tax reform this year differ substantially from those of the Minister's and Deputy Noonan's.</P>
      <P>There are clear choices to be made about the future direction of Irish society and the one positive result of this budget has been that it has provoked a serious debate about our social priorities for the future. It is a debate we need to continue and intensify. The type of compromise represented by 12 years of national agreements is simply over if the Minister's divisive and damaging social engineering is allowed to dictate Government economic policy. If the Taoiseach is serious about seeking an agreement to replace Partnership 2000 then he must clearly reject the McCreevy-Harney approach, accept that the budget has been unjust and a gross breach of faith and send it back for total redrafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a strong ideological Minister. Deputy Quinn dealt with that in some detail but we need to put into the context of the debate we are having about social partnership to understand how strongly held his views are. On the one hand, he and his Government say social partnership is the cornerstone of their economic policy and at the same time, his ideological recklessness in bringing in this budget has put social partnership at risk. This is a viciously anti-low pay, anti-poor budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with some interest to the Tánaiste's justification because she sees this as vicariously her budget. I heard her play around with statistics and so on. The fact is that one has to contextualise it. To be honest, it did not matter who was Minister for Finance or who was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs because the phenomenal growth and expansion we have seen in the economy for six or seven years would have continued unless some daft decisions were made by whatever Government was in office. The result is that this Government finds itself in a sit<Col N="1343" /> uation where it has moneys to give back to the people, the like of which we have never seen in the history of the State. Notwithstanding that, this Minister decided to do so in a fashion which is manifestly so unfair that it has provoked the outcry outside this House which we have seen over the past week and the withdrawal of the largest union from the talks.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has gone to extraordinary lengths to distance himself from the budget. We are only short of seeing him in the Glen of the Downs up the trees with the eco-warriors, because he has a certain amount of expertise in the area from his time in north Dublin going up and down the trees in relation to issue the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was trying to examine in London. Given his experience in trees, one is surprised not to find him in the Glen of the Downs. I looked back at speech on the budget last year and if I did not say who the speaker was, one might have thought it was either the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance. The Dáil Official Report for 3 December 1998, column 1579, shows the Taoiseach said the following about the budget: &ldquo;The higher earner can look forward to future budgets under this Government which will ease a burden heavier than in most other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach predicted clearly that there would be future budgets from this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government which would be biased in favour of higher earners and for him now to try to get out from under this and try to blame Deputies Harney and McCreevy is less than fair. Last year the Taoiseach was speaking to the House in the context of some of the damage the Minister for Finance did the previous year being undone in the sense that last year's budget was reasonably equitable, given its paternity. However, the Taoiseach put the extract I have read out on the record of the Dáil the next day, promising the better off that they would live to see better days under his Government. How can he then pretend to be a semi-detached member of the Government and that he had no involvement with the budget? He told Des Geraghty and Peter Cassells that the budget was lacking in balance. Then, just in case the Tánaiste thinks she and Deputy McCreevy are to be unleashed on the social partners, the great conciliator made it clear &ndash; at the same meeting with the social partners &ndash; that he would intervene and that the job was oxo; he would ensure that the lower paid were looked after and he would handle the forthcoming pay talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A more hands on approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A more hands on approach, if there are national pay talks. Let us be clear, John Dunne of IBEC made it clear that there could not be pay talks of any significance without SIPTU's involvement. That union has more than 200,000 members, almost half of whom are on relatively <Col N="1344" /> low pay. To pretend one could organise a new social contract in the absence of the country's largest union is to fool oneself. IBEC is not fooling itself; that organisation is on the record regarding this matter. There will not be a new agreement unless there is another change in the budget to address the issue of low pay. That will be budget No. 4 in one month. We had what Deputy Quinn referred to as budget No. 1, then we had the attempted renovation for stay at home spouses. We then had a social welfare package and we will now have to have a package for the low paid.</P>
      <P>This is very discriminatory. One could do what the Tánaiste did with figures and make the point in such a graphic way that it would not have much reality in the real economy or society. However, suppose one took a figure that is not unrealistic? Average industrial earnings will be £17,000 at the end of Partnership 2000 and that is a reasonably high figure if it is the average. A single income married couple living on those earnings stands to get £7.15 per week under Deputy McCreevy's budget. Despite the figures given by the self-employed &ndash; it is amazing how few people earn more than £25,000 per year in the self-employed category &ndash; there are many people on £50,000 a year. It is a rough economy to survive in. People earning £50,000 per year were given £31.17 per week by the Minister for Finance. No matter how one does the figures, the situation is that the higher earner gets at least three times more than the person on low income, with £7.15 being given to someone on average industrial earnings and £31.17 being given to those on £50,000 a year.</P>
      <P>This year £10 per week was given in personal allowances, which, before the budget, was the area where everyone agreed some positive advantage could be conferred on those on low incomes. However, the same Minister produced £21 per week in personal allowances last year. He did his own thing in his first budget, which also discriminated seriously against the low paid. He was hauled back last year as a result of the outcry, but he got off the leash again this year and the extraordinary situation arose wherein no other Cabinet Minister, we are told, was involved in this decision. What kind of Government is this when such a matter was regarded as a detail? Fair play to the great survivor, Dr. Woods. His spin doctor did the best job last weekend; Dr. Woods identified the problem first. No sooner did the Minister read out his speech than Dr. Woods saw the gaffe. He whispered it to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach became gloomy immediately, understanding he should have nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, his junior comrades did not see it at all. The Minister for Health and Children was heckling my party leader, saying: &ldquo;You do not know what he is talking about.&rdquo;  It is quite clear that Deputy Cowen did not know what he <Col N="1345" /> was talking about, but he knows now, as does the entire Front Bench.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One wonders how the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, if he knew, could not have forewarned his colleague.</P>
      <P>Social partnership is put at risk by the ideological drive behind this budget. It seriously discriminates against the lower paid and that discrimination cannot be made up for in pay talks. The majority of Mandate's members are on low pay and one third of SIPTU's members &ndash; more than 70,000 people &ndash; are on low pay and I cannot see how one can structure a new social contract in a fashion that positively advantages low income earners sufficiently to cause them to accept it in a ballot subsequently. The place to do that was in the tax code, where it was eminently feasible. A number of alternative systems for doing so had been outlined in advance of the budget and there appeared to be consensus on those systems across the entire spectrum of opinion from IBEC to Fr. Seán Healy.</P>
      <P>I am sure I have mentioned someone close to the Minister's heart. I know how close Fr. Healy is to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That consensus was ignored. The place to make sure lower paid people got advantages was in the tax code.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has a mantra she rhymes off all the time about the national minimum wage; how she has brought one in and the previous Government did not. She has not brought one in, of course, but she has promised one. However, £4.40 an hour has been overtaken in the marketplace. If one looks in any shop in Grafton Street one will see they cannot get staff. Dunnes Stores has an advertisement in the newspapers for 1,000 staff and gave a voluntary 6% increase last Friday week, though it has taken strikes for six weeks for people looking for less than 6%. The £4.40 has been overtaken, but even at that rate, depending on the hours one works, one earns between £170 and £186 per week. If the Government has decided that that is to be the yardstick for a minimum income in this society, how can it decide that someone earning £109 per week should be taxed? That £9, from £100 to £109, was the decision taken in this budget. The resources the Minister for Finance had were skewed in favour of the better off.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Minister, Deputy Harney is safe enough. She does not need me to defend her from attack. I will refrain from attacking the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. One of the most disheartening sights during the past year was that of people in wheelchairs fighting for their rights on a number of occasions outside the Dáil. It was a sad day when those people had to spend their time in wet and cold weather trying to bring their plight to the attention of Ministers and Deputies. For a long time backbenchers from all sides of the House have made a strong case for addressing the needs of people with disabilities. I have a deep interest in this area as one of my children is confined to a wheelchair. The Minister for Health and Children has recognised that something must be done for these people. The additional investment of approximately £69 million over the next year in services for people with disabilities is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>One matter that must be given serious attention is the provision of personal assistants for people in wheelchairs. The personal assistance service has been funded by FÁS over the past three or four years, but that was a stopgap measure. People who worked as personal assistants for three years or, in some cases, for one year, have had to step aside and the people with disabilities whom they were assisting have had to find other personal assistants. The Minister should make a strong case, through the health boards, for the appointment of personal assistants on a permanent basis to assist people in wheelchairs and not by way of a stopgap measure funded by FÁS. The Minister will have difficulty in achieving that because the health boards are unwieldy and are not serving any great purpose. He should review their operation to ascertain how they can be made more relevant to the people who need the services they provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> People with disabilities have been neglected for far too long. It is welcome that the Minister for Health and Children will make some changes to address that neglect. An additional £5 million will be allocated for aids and appliances for the physically disabled and a respite care grant to the value of £300 will be given, although that is far too low. The Minister should reconsider the value of this grant because we all know of cases where parents, the mother more often than not, spend their time looking after people with disabilities with little respite care or back-up services. I welcome the introduction of the respite care grant, but the allocation should be more generous.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of £7 per week for old age pensioners. It is a worthwhile increase but no more than old age pensioners deserve. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has made a serious effort over the past three years to give substantial increases to old age pensioners thereby ensuring they have a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to extend the free schemes to all people aged 75 and over. Members pressured the Minister for some time to introduce such a measure.</P>
    <P>A substantial increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will be introduced next year. While I welcome the increase, in some cases where a number of children in a family are attending school the increase may not be sufficient. Perhaps the payment of this allowance should be reconsidered on a sliding scale basis.</P>
    <P>Carers have been the group most neglected by Governments down through the years. I welcome the fact that the Minister will extend the free schemes to carers. This will ensure they will be able to gain access to free electricity, free television licence and free telephone rental.</P>
    <P>Although unemployment has fallen to 5%, in Wexford unemployment stands at 12%. While 5% may be the national average, some areas of the country have not benefited from the Celtic tiger economy. I draw the attention of the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment &ndash; I am not going to attack the Minister, Deputy Harney &ndash; to the need for selective investment in certain areas. Wexford is one of those areas. Despite major infrastructural developments there during the past five years and it having the port of Rosslare, it has not enjoyed the benefits of the Celtic tiger in terms of job creation. I ask the Ministers concerned to seriously examine this area and to encourage selective investment in the areas where it is required.</P>
    <P>While the introduction of a minimum wage of £4.40 on 1 April is to be welcomed, too many companies are trying to find ways around having to pay it. That rate should be increased to at least £5, given the rate of inflation. Many large companies do not intend to introduce the minimum wage until 1 April. They should implement it, and <Col N="1348" /> should be encouraged to do so, as quickly as possible and not wait until the legislation governing it is introduced. An earlier speaker said Dunnes Stores, Feargal Quinn's stores and some other companies have introduced a minimum wage, but other companies should not wait until 1 April to introduce it. They should introduce it immediately and stop whingeing about why they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive features of the budget. The Ministers for Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs fought a good case at Cabinet for the measures in their respective Ministries introduced in the budget. There was a hiccup on tax measures during the past two weeks. I welcome the new found interest of the Unions in their members. As a former shop steward, I consider the unions have not been doing their jobs for the low paid and certain sectors in recent years. It is welcome that Mr. Geraghty, Mr. Cassells and others are beginning to talk about another sector of the community, the low paid. I hope they will be provided for in whatever partnership arrangement is reached in the future. In previous partnership arrangements the less well off and the low paid have been left behind compared to middle income earners who have gained substantial increases. I thank the Ministers for Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs for putting their cases for the increases they secured for their respective Ministries.</P>

      <P>Under the budget, a widow will receive an extra £4 per week. If she lives in my constituency, she will be charged £3 per week to have her refuse collected, an extra £1 per week if she is on differential rent and a further 50p per week if she uses gas. Assuming inflation proceeds at the 3% rate anticipated by the Minister for Finance, the purchasing power of her pension will reduce by approximately £2.50 per week during the next year. Taken together, these represent an overall real income reduction of £7 per week. In other words, the widow will end up being worse off to the tune of £3 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us compare her situation with that of a household with an income of £100,000 per annum. That household will gain an extra £70 per week from the budget, an amount which is almost on a par with the widow's pension entitlement and which represents ten times the increase an old age pensioner will receive. How does the Government justify giving so much more to those who have most and giving so little to those who have nothing? Is there not any sense of fairness, <Col N="1349" /> equity or compassion informing the Government's budgetary consideration?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;where do Fianna Fáil backbenchers stand on the plight of widows? They were very vocal last week about women whose husbands have only one income. Where do they stand on women who are left with neither husband nor income? Do they think it is fair to give these women only £4 per week in a budget which gives so much to the better off? Do they think it is fair that a widow on a non-contributory pension has only £77 per week on which to live, while a wealthy person will obtain that amount and more from additional tax breaks announced in the budget?</P>
      <P>The discrimination against single income families was unfair and unjust. It has not been eliminated by last week's buy off. However, that was not the only unfair feature of the budget. The Government's decision to use the State's additional resources to favour the better off to the disadvantage of the poor was shameful. No previous Government ever had such an opportunity to reduce inequality and tackle poverty. The current Administration has turned its back on the poor to favour the rich. It has not offered any social or economic justification for making the rich richer and the poor poorer. There is not any such justification.</P>
      <P>We obtained a glimpse of the Government's thinking in the Minister for Finance's speech on budget day. He stated that &ldquo;We draw our mandate from the will of the people who clearly favoured the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats prescription on taxation at the last general election.&rdquo;  The same political argument was repeated by other Ministers in media interviews and it was again put forward earlier this evening by the Tánaiste. What does it mean? In a way it is accurate. There was a clear difference at the last general election between the taxation policy of the outgoing Rainbow Government, which favoured raising tax allowances to favour the lower paid&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>And forgot to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and what the Minister calls <Col N="1350" /> the &ldquo;taxation prescription&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats which favoured emphasised reductions in the top rate to favour the better off.</P>
      <P>In so far as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats formed a Government after the election, it can be superficially claimed that there was a mandate to favour the rich. However, apart from the leader writers in the Independent Group, how many voters, even those who voted for Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, understood that they were voting to rob the poor to pay the rich?</P>
      <P>Underlying this political justification for the budget, there is a more fundamental aspect of Government thinking. Put simply, it appears that the Government has concluded that the poor do not vote and, therefore, do not count. If that is the lesson which the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has learned from low turnouts, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, at recent elections, then poor people need to learn a very stark lesson about politics, namely, staying away on polling day means they will get screwed on budget day by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and if they really want to protect their interests and are serious about building a fairer society the ultimate answer is to vote the current Administration out of office as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The inequality in the budget is not even confined to the skewed benefits for those at different levels of earned income. Some of the biggest benefits in the budget are conferred on unearned speculative income. In his 1997 budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, caused considerable surprise by reducing capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. There had not been any public demand for such a reduction. No social or economic case was made then or since to justify halving the levels of capital gains tax.</P>

The Minister asked the rhetorical question &ldquo;Need I say more?&rdquo;  However, he did need to say more. He needed to explain that a <Col N="1351" /> yield of £343 million from capital gains tax at 20% meant that capital gains in 1999 amounted to £1.715 billion, of which £1.372 billion was completely free of tax, courtesy of the Minister's reduction in capital gains tax in 1997.</P>

      <P>&mdash;land speculator in the country and he has done so in a way which belies previously stated Government policy on residential development and housing policy.</P>
      <P>In the 1997 budget, the reduction in capital gains tax did not apply to development land. The Bacon report on housing prices argued that, because capital gains tax had been reduced from 40% to 20%, this reduction should apply, as a temporary measure, to the sale of land for housing development. A measure was then introduced to reduce capital gains tax on housing land from 40% to 20% for a period of four years, following which capital gains tax would increase again, not to the original 40% but to 60%. The logic was that a short-term incentive would be applied to landowners to encourage them to release land for residential development. It was made clear that this advantage would apply only to housing land and not to other development land. However, under the current budget, every type of development land is to be included.</P>
      <P>When referring to the changes made the 1997 and the recommendations of the Bacon report, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>This now leaves only one type of asset still liable at the 40% rate, that is disposals of development land for non-residential purposes such as for example road-building, or the construction of factories or offices. I have decided, therefore, for simplification reasons to apply the 20% rate to this remaining type of asset in the case of disposals occurring after today.</P>
      <P>In addition, where the holders of development land are taxed under the corporation tax or income tax codes instead of the capital gains tax code, the rate of tax that will apply in their case on the sale of land for residential purposes will be reduced to 20%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does reducing capital gains tax on land designated for road building or the construction of <Col N="1352" /> factories or offices help increase the supply of land for housing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This question obviously did not dawn on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government who between them issued eight press releases praising the budget on 1 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Both declared: &ldquo;The introduction of a 20% rate of tax on the sale of residential land for companies and individuals who had been liable for higher rates previously will further encourage the release of land for residential development.&rdquo;  Both Ministers were factually wrong. First, the 20% rate of CGT has applied since the Bacon report. Second, the advantage which had been conferred on housing land was wiped out in the budget. It does not matter what type of development the land is sold for as it will only attract a 20% tax.</P>
      <P>This measure confers an additional windfall on land speculators who already reap enormous profits from land rezonings, the property boom and the increased price of houses. A developer who, for example, owns agricultural land on the perimeter of a town or city and has it rezoned for any type of development already benefits from a huge increase in the value of the land, but when he sells it for ten or 20 times the price he paid, he will only be liable for a 20% tax. What is the justification for the Government playing Santa Claus to land speculators and property developers? There are currently two tribunals at Dublin Castle where some of Ireland's best lawyers and sharpest journalists are examining which developer made what gain and from whom in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance has done more in one measure in the budget to line the pockets of developers and land owners than any of those currently under investigation. Who has benefited from the budget?</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Economist</i> is accurate. That is the background against which the Minister had to work and it is the context in which he announced a total social welfare package of £132 million. It was a disgraceful increase when one considers the funds at his disposal. The tax package of £920 million was similar as the Minister wasted more than £700 million on individualisation and cutting tax rates rather than targeting workers earning less than £175 per week. The upshot is that the budget is effectively defunct and we are not sure what the Finance Bill will contain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate that the Government had no mandate following the last general election for a Progressive Democrats-oriented budget, which benefited the top 20% to 30% of the population much more than the bottom 30%, to be brought <Col N="1354" /> before the House. The most shameful and disgraceful aspect of the budget was the treatment of the 1.5 million citizens who depend on social welfare given that budget surpluses of more than £17 billion are predicted over the next four years along with a social insurance fund total surplus of almost £600 million during the same period.</P>
    <P>While the increases which take effect next May are welcome, they are disgraceful. As Fr. Seán Healy and CORI noted in their excellent and thoughtful review of the budget, Ireland spends less than any other EU country on social solidarity, except Portugal which has a much lower GNP <i>per capita</i> than Ireland. In addition, the share of the budget which the Government allocates to social welfare is declining steeply and now represents less than 8% of GDP, yet that amount provides the income for one third of the population. CORI and Fr. Healy best described the budget as &ldquo;anti-poor, anti-woman and anti-family&rdquo;. That is the budget which Fianna Fáil Members must defend on the doorsteps over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget must still pass through the House. An increase of £4 per week for social welfare recipients, other than the elderly, is an outrage and is totally shameful. As my party spokesperson on finance, Deputy McDowell, said on budget day, while unemployment assistance has been increased by £7.50, the carer's allowance to £80, the blind person's allowance to £77.50 and the disability allowance to £79.20, they are incredibly low incomes on which to expect people to live.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with all the key social welfare interests, the Labour Party set out its stall before the budget. We called for an increase of £6.50 to ensure all families dependent on social welfare reached at least the median income. However, this approach was totally rejected by the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs. Indeed, we went further in that we would have increased the payments to long-term claimants by at least £10. What is the point in stashing £4 million in a social welfare reserve fund next year when it is known that many people are on the bread line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on bringing forward the social welfare increases to 1 May, but both the tax and social welfare years should be synchronised in April. Indeed, the Minister for Finance said in his first Budget Statement that he would base the tax year on the calendar year and it is critical that the social welfare year should be synchronised with that. However, a range of payments will not be made until much later in 2000. For example, the new carer's benefit will not be introduced until November, child benefit <Col N="1355" /> is always introduced in September under this Government and the free schemes for carers will not be introduced until October 2000. Deputy O'Keeffe and I discussed the new capital assessment procedures at length with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, but they will not be in place until October 2000.</P>
    <P>The total social welfare package of £400 million is extremely misleading. The reality is that when the increases are introduced during the calendar year, the package is worth £132 million so far. The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are talking about an increased package. When that is compared to the £750 million which was misspent on taxation measures and, indeed, the £46 million, which Deputy Gilmore rightly said was wantonly squandered on capital taxation, the amount spent on social welfare is miserable.</P>
    <P>Over five Question Times, I have repeatedly asked the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to address the appalling low rates of dependant allowances. This is currently a disgraceful £43.20 for an adult dependent on long-term payments of unemployment assistance, pre-retirement, farm assist and disability allowances and blind person's pensions. Old age non-contributory pensioners only receive a miserable £44.20 at current rates.</P>
    <P>The Government has been repeatedly asked by the Labour Party to address the issue of individualisation of social welfare payments because of its dreadful impact on spouses in the home. However, instead the Government attacked the living standards of dependent spouses of workers through its policy of individualisation of tax bands. This policy was not discussed in the House or at any committee. It was not floated by the Minister and there was not any demand for it except in the fevered minds of Progressive Democrats and the Progressive Democrats dominated Fianna Fáil Party of today.</P>
    <P>Combat Poverty, Share the Wealth and a host of recent studies have asked for the dependant allowance rates to be raised to 70% of the main social welfare payment. Yet, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, are only prepared to do it over three years. This year, thousands of social welfare dependants must make do from next May with the princely rise of £3.80 a week, which brings the unemployment assistance dependant's allowance to a still disgraceful £47 a week.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of this ill-fated budget, carers, who were promised so much by the Fianna Fáil Party, feel cruelly let down. Every member of the Labour Party has been extensively contacted by the carers' organisations, including CROSSCARE and others, who are most unhappy at the lack of progress in this area this year. Less than 14,000 of the estimated minimum 50,000 full-time carers qualify for the carers allowance due to the restrictive means test. More than a week ago at a meeting of the Oireachtas <Col N="1356" /> Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, of which I am vice-chairman, I was informed by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern's officials that all full-time carers could be funded for approximately £150 million a year. With a budget surplus of £6 million and a 100 billion euro economy, why did the Government not fund all full-time carers? When it was in Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party said this issue would be dealt with, but after almost three years in Government it has not addressed it. The Labour Party's Deputy Proinsias De Rossa doubled the number of carers who benefit from the carers allowance.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the carers benefit, as advocated by me and Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for the past three years, is belatedly welcome. However, why are the conditions for qualifying for the benefit so restrictive? Why does it only last for one year? The Minister told the House that when a person who qualified for the carers benefit ran out of stamps, he or she could qualify for the carers allowance in certain circumstances. However, the conditions appear very restrictive.</P>
      <P>The blatant refusal of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to even consider a cost of caring allowance is disgraceful given that caring is not only about income support. It involves many other issues and costs. The £7 increase in contributory pensions is welcome, but the Senior Citizens' Parliament and the other groups representing the retired were expecting their £100 this year and not in May 2001.</P>

The longstanding demand of the Senior Citizens' Parliament and the trade unions' seniors group that contributory and non-contributory pensions should be directly linked to the average industrial wage at 34% and possibly rising to 40% has been totally ignored once again by the Government. However, it will not be ignored when the Labour Party returns to Government.</P>

      <P>Once again, the Minister forgot the real needs of widows, despite the revised death grant which is welcome. He blatantly refused to concede the £17 million in arrears to widows and seniors which are still owed. Many opinion makers feel these arrears should be paid as soon as possible. The Minister also refused to address the anomaly concerning widows' entitlement to disability benefit. In general, this was a disgraceful budget for social welfare from the author of 'the dirty dozen' cuts in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>While most attention in the budget shambles of last week was focused on the issue of individualisation of tax bands at one level, an equally serious failure by the Minister for Finance was his refusal to use available resources to significantly raise tax allowances to assist the lower paid. Why did the Minister spend, for example, £360 million on reducing rates to fulfil the Progressive Democrats' mantra on tax rates when he was only prepared to spend £202.5 million on increasing personal and married persons allowances? He spent a further £310 million on individualisation but did almost nothing to improve the tax position of people earning less than the proposed minimum wage of £4.40 an hour or £175 a week. A radical budget would use available resources to take most of these workers out of the tax net. However, such a budget would not conform to the failed New Zealand model beloved of the Progressive Democrats and their fellow travellers in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Last week, following the unprecedented revolt by Fianna Fáil Party backbenchers, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, refused to back down on the socially divisive individualisation of tax bands and introduced instead the £3,000 tax allowance for one income families with spouses at home caring for children under the age of 18, the aged and the handicapped. However, the Minister has embarked on a further divisive and fundamentally unfair policy by separating the tax treatment of one income couples with children from one income couples without children and implicitly castigating families without children. The proposed tax relief at the standard rate is worth only half the tax relief previously granted to two income families in the budget. In addition, the Minister has created a new poverty trap since the new tax allowance is accessible only to families with one spouse working. A further gap has been opened by the Minister between working families and families on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell, who were then in Opposition, excoriated what they called whistle blowers. Section 153 <Col N="1358" /> of the 1995 Finance Act introduced by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, imposed certain minimal qualifications of honesty on the professional advisers of tax cheats. I have always thought that the Minister persued tax compliance with a heavy heart and it is against this background that I assess his approach to capital taxation. He praised himself because £343 million was collected in capital gains tax in 1999 and said it was vindication of his reduction in the rate of capital gains tax to 20%. However, much of this would have happened in a soaring economy and good tax collection practice.</P>
    <P>It is monstrously unfair that people with large resources should pay tax on unearned income at the same rate as a person who earns under £9,000 a year. What was the rationale for reducing the capital gains tax rate from 40% to 20% on the disposal of development land for non-residential purposes? The Minister said the reason was simplicity but I wonder.</P>
    <P>On capital acquisitions tax, there is a general welcome for the family home exemption, even under the strict conditions. However, the rationale of abolishing the 30% and 40% rates appears to be mainly motivated by covert pressure from the rich class which the Minister represents.

      <P>The Minister came in for much criticism over individualisation. It is easy to put a label on a Minister or politician, and usually it sticks. If we look back over the Minister's history we will see he has been very effective and has not allowed himself to be dictated to. Instead he puts his own stamp on whatever brief he is given. As one who treats politics seriously, he treats his portfolio very seriously. Mention was made earlier of the dirty dozen. Attempts were made to take the Minister's seat from him, as Deputy Durkan will realise although he was not part of it, but they were unsuccessful.

It is possible the Deputy saw a programme on television the night before and decided to come in with the new Fine Gael policy. I am sure it was not a policy that was approved by the Front Bench. If we are serious about tobacco consumption and the damage it is doing to the health of the nation we will have to introduce a total ban on tobacco advertising. I realise we have some of the most restrictive measures in place in Europe and we have a general prohibition on indirect advertising. We also have restrictions on sponsorship and have capped the amount that can be spent on advertising generally. The tobacco industry is a wealthy one and spends a fortune on advertising. We have sexy advertisements on a regular basis aimed at young people. Given that many of their customers are dying, there is a need to recruit new people. That is the reality. We need a complete ban on tobacco advertising and I have asked the Government to bring it in as quickly as possible.</P>

We have had wonderful developments, prize money has been increased and facilities at the tracks improved. However, the one group that has been forgotten is the stable staff. I appeal to racecourses throughout the country to redress this wrong. The facilities which many of these people have to put up with are disgraceful. In many cases there are no toilet facilities and there is no area in which to change or have a hot snack. They are putting up with conditions which another group would not tolerate. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that all <Col N="1363" /> race tracks provide basic facilities for the stable staff.</P>
      <P>There is a race meeting at Tramore on New Year's Day. It will be the only race meeting in Europe that day.</P>

      <P>Deputies expressed concern in this House for years, about the negative impact of the hearing impairment claims on the Defence Forces. I am happy that a system has finally been devised and that the matter can now be dealt with in a cool and calm atmosphere away from the spotlight.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, announced major investment in the Defence area, part of which is taking place at present, and it is not before time. In many cases the Defence Forces were working in dilapidated conditions. I am delighted that has finally been acknowledged and an attempt is being made to rectify that situation.</P>
      <P>In restructuring the Defence Forces it is vital that all members are kept fully informed of the proposed changes and they do not have to depend on newspapers to discover where lies their future. They deserve better than that. They make a tremendous contribution and they should be treated with dignity in that matter.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have been here for some time should all look back, in the context of this budget, at some of the budgets we have witnessed. I remember coming in here to discuss the 1987 budget, which tried only to start to turn around what had been inherited by the Fianna Fáil Government which came into office in that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Sheehan has a short memory and he appreciates that I have a long memory at times, but in this case we were in a budgetary position of which none of us could have dreamt in 1987. There is tremendous economic growth. Ireland is the fastest growing economy in Europe. This is something which must be attributed to the actions of Governments over the past 12 years. The Governments have done their utmost to allow the economy to grow as fast as possible, while controlling inflation and all the other problems which can result from fast growing economies.</P>
      <P>The current buoyancy in the economy frightens some of us, but when one reads that it is predicted the economy will grow at a rate of between 5% and 6%&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Deputy Sheehan reads all the economic pages of the newspapers, which will have told him this over the past number of years. However, when one reads that it is predicted the economy will grow at a rate of between 5% and 6% over the next three to five years and that the economy will continue to grow at a fast rate for the next ten years, it is important that we should look at how we can best treat that economy and keep it growing. With record numbers of people in employment, these are unprecedented times. In my 20 years in politics, I have not ever seen the rate of unemployment so low. It is at its lowest in memory and it has been so for quite some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>When that rate was low before, it was because people had been forced to emigrate due to the action of certain Governments. Not only are we able to look after those coming into the <Col N="1365" /> labour market on an annual basis, but we are able to make sure that we can deal with the 40,000 who are returning every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the 40,000 people who see a better future in Ireland than in some of the other economies which they have helped to build over the past ten or 20 years.</P>
      <P>We must pay tribute to some of the people who went long before us. Current growth in the economy is due to the educational measures which were introduced by the late Donogh O'Malley in the 1960s. His policy was not short-term; it was a long-term policy and we will continue to reap the benefits of this top quality education system. We must acknowledge that, and acknowledge those parents in the 1960s or 1970s who made the sacrifices and set about giving their children the education of which they were deprived in many cases.</P>
      <P>Recent Government decisions seek to spread the Celtic tiger economy to the Objective One region. My colleagues in the border, midlands and west region and I welcome that the region has been given Objective One status. It gives us an opportunity to catch up with some of the more affluent areas, which have faired better in the past, the areas represented by Deputies Sheehan and Durkan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the various social welfare increases in the budget. The £100 pension, of which many people dreamed, is practically a reality and it will be a reality following the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>I welcome the other increases in the social welfare programme. That the increases are being brought forward to May is an improvement. This process will continue until such time as such increases apply from the same date as the other changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan is a little confused and annoyed, but no doubt the yellow paper he has in front of him is a reflection of the way his <Col N="1366" /> party is feeling because it is neither in a 'go' or 'stop' position; it is in limbo.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction of 2% in both tax bands and the changes to the allowances. I welcome last week's decision by the Minister to deal with the anomaly which arose from his original budget proposals. It is a positive step. It does one thing to which no one has given recognition, that is, it recognises stay-at-home spouses. I welcome the fact that this assistance will be made available for those who care for the elderly, the disabled or their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt when Deputy Sheehan issues his budget bulletin, as far as west Cork is concerned, he will be only too glad to welcome the changes of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation was mentioned in the budget and in the future this will affect the area which I represent. With modern technology one can operate any organisation from any part of this island. The infrastructure which has been put in place will be of benefit. When it comes to making those decisions, I hope the Minister will see fit to look at areas which have suffered as a result of the Northern troubles for the past 30 years. I represent one of those areas which has suffered badly as a result of the Northern troubles. Yesterday's meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh was an occasion that many of us had dreamed of but never thought we would see. Let us now reap the benefit of a country that is at peace and whose economy can grow both North and South at an unprecedented level. Let us make sure, however, that future economic growth is divided equally so that disadvantage will not be carried into the next millennium. There is a need to spread the gains of the Celtic tiger right across the country and I have no doubt the Government will endeavour to do that. In so doing, decentralisation can be a major initiative to encourage people to return to rural areas, thus alleviating the housing problems in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the debate, speakers mentioned capital gains tax which for many years prevented people from disposing of property which could have been used for housing and various industrial development projects. This did not happen, however, because people were not prepared to pay capital gains tax. The budget will do a lot to help continued economic growth and to deal with those who are marginally disadvantaged. It will help to improve the lot of the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a wide-ranging debate on what is an interesting budget, although the debate on one aspect of it has been myopic. Perhaps that aspect of the debate should have been flagged earlier because many of the budget's many fine measures have been lost sight of. The budget should be seen in context and we should <Col N="1367" /> not forget that the national development plan, with an overall investment of £41 billion, was published just a few weeks ago. It indicates the broad strategies the Government proposes to take between now and 2006. On the other side of the budget we have the talks on pay and social partnership which have in the past proved to be an important pointer to the way society wants to progress. As a measure of how the Government sees the direction in which it wants to go, it has committed £485 million to social inclusion, which is £40 million short of what the rainbow coalition committed in its entire period in office.</P>
      <P>The first thing to bear in mind about the current period of economic affluence is that it is largely attributable to the good housekeeping policies of Fianna Fáil in Government with the Progressive Democrats. This economic affluence means that gainful employment is now available to most people who are capable of working. The Government's function is to manage the economy which means creating the circumstances that enable citizens to live their lives in comfort. The Government has gone a long way towards achieving that objective.</P>
      <P>Through a combination of wages and taxation people have the resources to achieve that comfort and the Government also has the resources to provide services that such an economy requires. The recent budget was the third presented by the present Government. Ten years ago a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance said that we would replace doom and gloom with boom and bloom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, and we are only just starting. I would remind the House that it was Fianna Fáil in Government who first invited the social partners to participate in creating economic programmes for the distribution of wealth to benefit all sectors of society. It is a proud record that we will stand over. No one will be looking over our shoulders wondering whether the Minister should be second guessed as to what figures he should put forward as opening positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Families must now earn in excess of £40,000 before paying tax at the higher rate, which has been reduced from last year. The lower rate of tax has also been reduced. I expect that very few of my constituents will pay income tax at the higher rate and for that reason alone I commend the budget to the House. It is a far cry from the situation that prevailed only five short years ago when the lower rate of tax was 27%, five points higher than the current budget proposal, and the higher rate was 48%, four points higher than the current budget figure. In addition, families paid tax at the higher rate on taxable earnings of just over £20,000. Looking at the same period, the old age pension, of which we have heard much in this debate, has increased from £71 per week for a <Col N="1368" /> single person to £96 per week. I have no doubt that in the course of the next two budgets the old age pension will go far beyond the £100 per week figure which everybody aspires to but thought was impossible. The percentage rate increases in this year's and last year's budgets was 7%, which is three times the rate of inflation and the highest percentage increase in 15 years. During that time, Fine Gael and the Labour Party spent significant periods in office. I welcome the fact that these increases are being brought forward to 1 May 2000. There is a commitment that in next year's budget they will be brought forward to 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>I want to address the issue of low pay. Long before the parade on the plinth started, I raised the question of low pay which is a key issue in constituencies such as mine. Despite the fact that the Celtic tiger is purring, thriving and rampant for many people&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is never on the plinth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;there are significant pockets in my constituency where the spectre of unemployment still haunts us. Many people in my constituency have only recently gone back to work. It is imperative that we provide as much inducement, attraction and encouragement to such people to remain in paid employment. For that reason, anyone who is earning less than the minimum wage &ndash; whether or not it will be increased from £4.40, and I hope it will &ndash; ought to be removed altogether from the tax net. I listened with interest to the Tánaiste's remarks earlier in Private Members' time and I welcomed what she had to say.</P>
      <P>One of the social welfare issues I have been raising for a long time is that of pre-1953 pension contributions. I did not hear many Members talking about this issue in the debate. I am glad there is a commitment in the budget to address in the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill that group of elderly people, all of whom started work prior to 1953. It is an injustice that needs to be rectified. The Minister should go the whole hog and implement the measure which would cost in the region of £25 million.</P>
      <P>I welcome the budget's improvements in the carer's allowance. As regards the back to school allowance, if one has a large family and is living in Dublin, peer pressures are applied to young people at school, but we should be courageous and try to increase the back to school allowances even more significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax relief for the elderly whereby a couple over 66 years of age can have an income of £15,000 before they are liable to tax is an enlightened measure which has been welcomed by Muintir na Tíre. The issue of child care has not been well addressed during the debate. Some £42 million has been committed to the supply side for a variety of initiatives of which people should be reminded. Some £23 million is being made available to expand the equal opportunities child care <Col N="1369" /> programme which is working in my constituency and many disadvantaged areas in Dublin and other cities. It is making a difference to women who want to go back to work and people who want to return to training and education.</P>
    <P>The £10 million grant scheme for child care service providers catering for up to 20 children is a key measure along with other key initiatives. Anyone who listened to the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; radio programme this morning, broadcasting from Fatima Mansions, will have heard about the homework clubs. I am delighted a significant figure of about £5 million is being made available so that after school child care activities can be undertaken. When one bears in mind the amount of activity that many schools are now promoting through the home-school liaison service and through interaction with the local community, this sort of initiative is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, I welcome the disability initiative and compliment the work Carol Canning and others have been doing in that regard. In regard to the suicide prevention initiative, in recent months there have been several suicides of young people in my constituency in Mountjoy and other prisons. I welcome the Minister's initiative, which I hope will be well used. There are many other aspects I could talk about. I commend this extremely good budget to the House.</P>

      <P>One should be happy and joyous at Christmas time, especially after a budget which made available a great deal of loot to be given away. We heard over the past months about the great expectations that were whipped up. Appetites were whetted in all directions. Would it be £1 billion, £1.5 billion or £2 billion? How high was the bid? How was the electorate to be wooed and massaged? I am genuinely sorry for the Government because it has perpetrated on itself the most awful disaster possible, given the present state of our economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is a decent and honourable constituency colleague of mine. I have no doubt that the budget is not his work. I do not know who concocted it, but it certainly could not have been the Minister because he knows too much about life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the scene. When he finished his Budget Speech, the Government Members walked out of the House but the Members on this side recognised the problem straight away. I heard a journalist suggesting he was the first person to identify the snags in the budget. He must not have been <Col N="1370" /> listening to what was being said here because the snags were identified on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Government side retreated to have their tea and clap each other on the back. They went away at the weekend full of glory. That once proud group of soldiers of destiny sailed away into the sunset, full of happiness. When they came back the following Tuesday morning and passed the savage seven on the plinth, they recognised that something had gone severely wrong.</P>
      <P>What had gone wrong was that, for the first time since 1977, the people's appetites had been whipped up to the extent that the Government could no longer control them. People had been selectively identified and isolated and the spotlight was suddenly placed on them. When they were isolated, they recognised how vulnerable they were. Segments of society suddenly recognised they were under threat. It was fine for some, which is how it always is. Some people will always win, but it should not be the situation that some people will lose.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Government was able to produce a budget, the like of which was never seen before in terms of the funds available, which offended so many people in a way which made them really angry. In 1977 the public was told that the outgoing Government was wrong, that it did not have to be that hard, that there was plenty of money and that all that had to be done was to give it out. Everybody has forgotten that that Government abolished motor tax. Every motorist thought that was wonderful and that the previous Government had not being telling the true story. That Government also abolished rates. The theme was to put more money in people's pockets. Within two short years the economy was in tatters. Nobody could have anticipated that.</P>
      <P>Margaret Thatcher, in another economy, over a series of years selectively identified segments of the population which were rewarded at the expense of others. Not only did she divide the country socially and economically, she also divided her own party and ensured it was put out of office. It will be very lucky to return to office in our lifetime.</P>
      <P>The same economic thesis was being pursued in both cases. Enterprise and industry must be rewarded. However, that must not be done in a way which gives the impression to the people that there is so much to be given away that the Government does not know how to give it.</P>
      <P>The Government is now suffering. It is in the unenviable position of being out touting &ndash; prostituting itself &ndash; and wondering which group of people to which it can give the most to get them off its back. That is a sad situation. I do not know if the Government fully recognises or understands the damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Power did not go on the plinth to excoriate his colleague. However, criticism from that side of the House of the Opposition is very close to the bone, when one considers one could not walk across the plinth last week without bumping into Government back<Col N="1371" /> benchers excoriating their own Minister. They flogged him well and truly to death at every opportunity. There is no point in Members on the other side of the House telling us we are wrong.</P>
    <P>Another budget was then produced, although nobody read it into the record of the House. It was touted around the country for two or three days until another group of people were offended by it.</P>
    <P>What has happened now is the worst of all. Several groups of people are still deeply offended by the first offer. It reminded me of a reckless group of gamblers going into a casino with their pockets full of money, placing all their money on the first roulette table and then discovering that someone who was not in their group, and whom they did not know, had won the whole pot.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely saddened and sorry about what has happened. I am not saying that for party political reasons. Very serious damage has been, and is being done. All the discussions will take place outside the House of Parliament, because no Member of this House will believe any revised budget at this stage.</P>
    <P>The legacy of this budget &ndash; the greatest opportunity of all time &ndash; is not how one would like to remember this millennium. Some wag mentioned here last week that this was an historic budget as it was the budget of the millennium. The candle would not go through the letter boxes and the budget would not go through the lobbies. One morning, even the printer failed and the Order of Business could not be printed. I am saddened&mdash;</P>

      <P>I attended an eviction in my constituency a week ago. I do not blame the landlord in this case because he wanted his house back. However, at this time of financial full and plenty, there was no place for that man to go with his three children, except on to the road. With all the <Col N="1372" /> hoo-ha we have heard about what was going to happen and the great effort one could expect from the combined thinking of the two parties in Government, that is not the way to commemorate the millennium and the budget.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal of talk about what was done in regard to social welfare. One of the election promises a couple of years ago was that an old age pensioner would get £100. We have heard this was the greatest giveaway budget of all time, but the same is said of every budget. The Government promised five budgets, each of which was to be an improvement on the previous one. We have already had three budgets this year, one worse than the other, so I hate to think of what the next two will be like.</P>

      <P>I want to explode the myth we hear every year about the number of people who will be taken out of the tax net. This is achieved by looking at those who are barely in the tax net and measuring up a little. This myth has been perpetrated on the public every year since I became a Member of this House and I hope it does not continue. The budget is a disaster and I hope the Government parties will apologise to the people, say they are mortally sorry for what they attempted to perpetrate on them and call an election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. The budget was unfair, it lacked vision and squandered the substantial resources available to the Government. It was unfair because it failed to use the small proportion of available resources to eliminate poverty and because it distinguished between the so-called deserving and the undeserving poor. The budget was anti-poor. The Government was faced with a wide range of choices and chose the rich. The budget was skewed towards the better off, giving them substantial gains as against the poor who, once again, were left to collect the crumbs from the Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>This budget was also anti-women because it discriminated against those women who wish to stay at home to look after their families. It was anti-family because it favoured single people and gave few benefits to children and those families in which one parent stays at home to look after children, rather than taking up employment. This was a deeply divisive budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister performed a U-turn but did he think he was living in a Middle Eastern country where women are not allowed to vote? He disregarded the voting power of Irish women when he introduced this draconian budget. More resources were available to the Government this year than ever before. It could have used these resources to eliminate poverty, tackle the problems of child poverty and child care and take those on the minimum wage out of the tax net <Col N="1373" /> while still having enough money to address issues of disabilities, health care, homelessness and adult illiteracy. The Government could have given everyone with a job the same benefits from the tax changes but chose to give large benefits to the better off. This is a scandalous squandering of resources and is indefensible in the context of the poverty and social exclusion which remain so prevalent. This is an unfortunate beginning to the millennium and leaves many people with no reason to rejoice next January.</P>
    <P>This was an accountant's budget which tried to meet the demands of those who see success in budgetary terms as developing a better environment for investment and competitiveness while ignoring the centrality of social inclusion. The budget was blind to the needs of those employed or on low pay, and to those who cannot access well paid jobs because of ill health, poverty or disability. It failed to address major issues in areas such as the environment, rural development and economic and social sustainability. This was a budget which lacked the vision we need if we are to see the emergence of a just, fair and sustainable society in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The old age pension has been increased by only £7 per week or £1 per day, and only £4.70 for qualified adults or 67p per day. A plug of tobacco now costs £7.50, an increase of £1. The budget increased child benefit by £8 per month for the first two children and by £10 per month for subsequent children. Big deal.</P>

The same increase was given to the disabled and the pre-retirement pension. What good is £4 per week? It would buy nothing for these unfortunate people. The winter fuel allowance is only £5 per week which would not buy a bucket of coal for misfortunate people who need heat as much as food to survive.</P>

      <P>The increase in pension and unemployment benefits will not come into effect until May 2000 and increases in child benefit will not come into force until September 2000. The free electricity and television licences and the carer's allowance will not come into force until October 2000. Who does the Minister think he is codding? Why did he introduce a budget in <Col N="1374" /> December 1999 when its provisions do not come into effect until October 2000? The special £1,000 grant to widows and widowers with qualifying children will not take effect until December 2000. The next budget will take place in the first week of December 2000, yet these allowances will not take effect until the same week. What is going wrong? The £4 per week increase in the carer's allowance is derisory for people who give full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was tabulating his percentage of gross expenditure he stated that industrial labour will get 3.8%, agriculture will get 3.8%, fisheries and forestry, for which the Minister of State is responsible, will only get 0.4% and tourism 0.3%. This means that these sectors will only receive 8.3% of the gross current expenditure while those under &ldquo;other expenditure&rdquo; get  11.7%, one eighth of the total. What does &ldquo;other expenditure&rdquo; include? Why does it get 11.7%, or one eighth of gross expenditure, while industrial labour, agriculture, fisheries and forestry and tourism only get 8.3% in total? The Minister should not cod the people of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>No previous Minister for Finance had such a surplus of money to disperse to the underprivileged, yet the Minister blew it to the winds without taking into consideration that he was reining in a wild Celtic tiger which was only a cub when we were in power.</P>

      <P>Its effect could not be seen because it was too young to make its impression felt. The cub has grown to a tiger and the Government has given nothing to the underprivileged. Nothing was provided for hip, knee, eye, ear and throat operations or for a proper machine to deal with cancer cases in Cork University Hospital. What about the West Cork Wheelchair Support Group which cares for unfortunate wheelchair users from Clonakilty to Mizen Head and from Enniskeen to the Jersey Sound? The Minister did not give that group one pound. Who is he codding? Neither he nor any member of the Government should show their faces in my constituency until the damage done by this budget is corrected. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, should tell the Minister for Finance to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for sharing their time. Historians will write that this Government was one with an embarrassment of riches that quickly became a rich embarrassment. The defining moment of the budget speech came when the Minister for Finance made an unscripted reference to his famous holiday in the south of France, where the Tánaiste also holidayed &ndash; she found the remark hilarious and clapped gleefully. This showed the smugness, arrogance, self-satisfaction and complacency of the Government and its contempt for ordinary <Col N="1375" /> people. The Minister was saying &ldquo;Damn you plebs, we will go ahead with this anyway, we do not care, we are radicals&rdquo;. That was the word used constantly &ndash; this was a radical budget. It is reminiscent of the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell of the Progressive Democrats who once said that one must become radical or redundant. After this budget, the Minister was nearly redundant.</P>
      <P>Clearly he does not understand the true meaning of the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo;. As I understand it, radical comes from the Latin word, <i>radix</i>, which means root, going back to the root causes of our problems. It does not mean taking the extreme and divisive measures of the budget which were reminiscent of the <i>faux pas</i> made by the Progressive Democrats during the last election when it proposed the redundancy of 25,000 civil servants. This is exactly the same pattern. Those in Fianna Fáil should be wary of their Progressive Democrats colleagues who could be leading them astray. We need to find out who was responsible for this. From what I heard on the plinth last week, Fianna Fáil backbenchers were outraged by what had taken place.</P>
      <P>Being radical is about going back to the root causes, not the &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; or Thatcherite philosophy. We must remember what Thatcherism was about. It was not about family, community or society, it was quite the opposite. Margaret Thatcher famously said there is no such thing as society. I hope some members of Fianna Fáil still believe in family, community and society. If one goes back to the root causes, one finds out what constitutes quality of life, another phrase constantly used by the Minister for Finance. He talked about social inclusiveness and quality of life. Clearly, he does not understand what quality of life means. Some of the major thinkers in the Green Party have defined this. They have shown that since the mid-1970s as GDP has increased &ndash; Deputy Ellis spoke about our wonderful growth rates &ndash; quality of life has decreased. Quality of life was measured by the index of sustainable economic welfare, which takes many factors into account, housing, health, traffic congestion and the environment. This budget did not look at any of these issues. As a consequence of this budget, our housing problems will worsen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to suicide rates. Why, in this era of the Celtic tiger, are suicide rates increasing? We need to look at why this is happening in an age of affluence. It comes down to what was said by Erich Fromm, the philosopher, &ldquo;If I am, what I have&rdquo;. If what I have is taken away, what am I? We measure people in terms of their wealth, not as human beings. This budget subscribed to the &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; philosophy. It is exacerbating the difficulties experienced in society. For example, in the area of the health services, why are cancer rates increasing? We know that 80% of cancers are linked to the environment. This budget does nothing to address our severe environmental problems, the fact that the <Col N="1376" /> air in this city is getting worse daily and that traffic congestion is increasing. I watched the Minister on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night, speaking about the Glen of the Downs. His solution is to widen roads. That does not improve quality of life and is not about going back to the root causes. It serves to increase the volume of cars on the road which will not improve quality of life.</P>
    <P>The budget also widens the gap between rich and poor. The starkest statistic of this budget, as emphasised by Father Seán Healy of the Conference of Religious in Ireland, is that the most prosperous 10% improved in percentage terms at a rate seven times higher than the least prosperous 10% of the population. This statistic remains unaltered by the Minister's latest tinkering of the budget. What should the Minister have done? The Green Party's budget submission outlined a package similar in terms of cost but much better in terms of equity. Recognising the burden that child care costs are placing on couples whose circumstances are forcing both parents to work outside the home, the Green Party proposed the doubling of child benefit, with that becoming liable for tax. For those outside the tax net, the full benefit of a minimum of £450 per child would be gained. Even those taxed at the higher rate would receive a 6% increase on current levels of child benefit. Targeting child benefit in this way would have meant the best use of resources and not the scattergun approach of the Minister.</P>
    <P>As regards social welfare, we proposed a 10% increase which would have seen higher payments to pensioners and all social welfare recipients. This would have gone a long way to ensuring that those on the lowest rates of social welfare would have been within striking distance of having an income of at least 50% of the average income. After this budget such recipients are still £10 a week below a 50% average rate. Our proposed tax changes may not have been as generous as the K-Club tendency demonstrated by the Minister. However, our proposals were infinitely more equitable.</P>
    <P>The Green Party would have raised personal tax allowances by £800, as opposed to the £500 proposed in the budget. We also proposed a £500 increase in the PAYE allowance, which was ignored by the Minister and which would have been a further incentive for those in double income homes. While we proposed a £1,000 increase in the standard rate allowance, we also proposed a buffer 10% rate on £1,000 of taxable income at an intermediate rate of 33% per cent on another £1,000 of taxable income, before entering the highest tax rate. In accordance with our belief that PRSI is less an insurance fund and more a flat-rate tax, we proposed reductions of £500 million, shared equally between employees and employers. This area was largely ignored by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This was a lost opportunity. We could have achieved so much in this budget. We could have moved towards a guaranteed basic income, which <Col N="1377" /> is being studied, as the Taoiseach replied at Question Time. So much could have been done and so little was achieved. The Government is in a difficult position because social partnership will break down as a consequence. This is because the Government has encouraged a greedy society. People now see that those who are good friends of Fianna Fáil and of the Government have benefited most. That is not the way in which to run a country or society, that is if the Government believes in society.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Departments concerned with the budget. However, because of recent controversies, recent budget proposals for social welfare increases have not received due recognition. I propose to list some of them here tonight. There is an increase of £7 per week in maximum personal rates for pensioners and £11.70 for a couple on contributory pension. This is the highest such increase in the history of the State. I was amused listening to Opposition Members referring to promises made some years ago. I spoke to an old gentleman at the week-end who said that when the old age pension was ten shillings, an inter-party government took one shilling from old age pensioners.</P>

There is a radical development in the extension of free schemes which will be extended to all those over the age of 75 years regardless of income or household composition from October 2000. This measure is indicative of a caring budget for older people who have contributed so much to the success of society. I remind Deputy Neville that in the not too distant past his party leader went on his two knees to the late Deputy Kemmy following a budget measure which taxed children's shoes.</P>

I welcome also the measures introduced for the purpose of supporting carers. These people are the unsung heroes of our society who look after the needs of the elderly and the disabled. For example, 40% of people over 65 years may require long-term care at some point. These new measures are as follows. A social insurance carers benefit, based on PRSI contributions, will be introduced from October 2000. This will allow people to take time off work for caring responsi<Col N="1378" /> bilities. It will be payable for up to 12 months at the rate of £88.50 per week. The annual respite care grant will be increased by £100 to £300 from next June. Free electricity and TV licence will be extended to people receiving carer's allowance or caring for people receiving constant attention or prescribed relative's allowance from October 2000.</P>

      <P>I am pleased at the elimination of inequality and discrimination and that the full integration of people with disabilities into society has become a priority.

Unfortunately the budget has got lost since its announcement in the Dáil. Much of the personal criticism of the Minister has been totally unjustified. Members must accept that Deputy McCreevy is a man of vision and serious determination and resolve. He was man enough to face up to and change some minor mistakes in the budget.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that people rushed to the plinth and the media to get their faces on television. This seems to be the order of the day nowadays. It was unfortunate so many Members took this action, particularly members of my own party. While I appreciate the right of people to free speech, I sometimes cast my mind back to the eighties when we had what could be described as hair shirt budgets. Bankruptcy was facing us and the IMF was waiting in the wings. It was the actions of people like Deputy McCreevy and people in the Fianna Fáil party who took over as a minority Government in 1987 which sowed the seeds of our success today and for which we should be grateful.</P>
      <P>The budget has opened up a whole new debate in this country. While one tries to analyse the changes which have taken place in society, I must admit that perhaps the revelations of recent tribunals and matters which have come into the public domain on a constant basis have made people more aware of their rights and concerns. People are aware of and demand their rights nowadays, and rightly so. Ireland has come a long way and politicians such as Deputy McCreevy are responsible for the openness and transparency in society. He has never been afraid to express his views.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes to the budget. I supported the call for recognition of the spouse in the home looking after children, the handicapped and the aged. I have no doubt that the mistakes made in this budget will be corrected in the next two budgets. Ironically, it was easier when the Minister for Finance had very little money to distribute and was looking for money to balance his budget. The same applies to Deputies. I never thought I would say it was easier to be a Deputy during a recession than when things are good. People are very demanding nowadays. They know their rights and they expect instant reaction from their public representatives. Prior to the last election, Fianna Fáil drew up its manifesto based on the family and I hope it will do everything outlined in that manifesto. I look forward to the debate on the partnership agreement under which Fianna Fáil seeks special recognition for the lower paid. I welcome the social welfare package which gives increases to old age pensioners. I commend the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, particularly for the better deal he has introduced for people with physical and mental handicap, an issue dear to his heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a party, we must look after the weak and the most vulnerable in our society. I have noticed over the past number of weeks that there are certain people in our society about whom nobody is shouting. I refer to widows, widowers, lone parents, people in receipt of disability allowance and other social welfare recipients who only received an additional £4 per week. I was very disappointed with that. It is not enough. Most of these people live in local authority houses and when they get their increases in the coming months, it will be taken from them by an increase in local <Col N="1380" /> authority rent. There is no reason the social welfare increases could not be extended to widows, widowers and other recipients of social welfare benefit. I hope that will be redressed in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the increases and additional services in health but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the provision of orthodontic treatment in my South-Eastern Health Board area, which is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced several supports for mentally and physically handicapped people and one of the areas in which improvements could be made is the provision of rural transport. I welcome the improvements in the carer's allowance, an area about which we get a substantial number of representations. Regardless of what we do in that respect, we can never do enough, particularly in cases where full-time care and attention are required.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see recently in the national roads plan that £250 million has been allocated to my own county of Kilkenny for the realignment of the roads in the county. In terms of the national plan, and speaking from experience of working at local level, I sometimes wonder if we have the technical expertise available to us. Do we have contractors ready to carry out the work and the personnel necessary to fully implement the plan? That is something to which we must give careful attention because the current planning process is lengthy. There will be many compulsory acquisitions, roads will have to be designed, etc., and all that involves a great deal of preparation. I am concerned that we do not have the expertise in our local authorities. With the amounts of money being spent, that is something we need to address.</P>
    <P>One of my greatest causes of concern in public life is the difficulty with the planning process. The planning process in my own county is archaic. The current volume of planning applications for various developments are processed in the same way as 20 years ago. That is not good enough in a progressive society. I am aware the Final Stages of the Planning and Development Bill will be debated in the House in the new year. That is welcome legislation which needs to be brought to fruition as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Water and sewerage infrastructure throughout the country is a priority and I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will publish a plan for every county, from the smallest village to the largest town, because our infrastructure is not capable of dealing with the type of development currently taking place.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has been one of the most innovative Ministers for a long number of years, and I compliment him on that. I would like to take this opportunity of raising the question of third level grants. Some years ago, I served in the Department of Education with a Labour Minister for Education who abolished <Col N="1381" /> third level fees. That has turned out to be a costly mistake. There is no comparison between people living in affluent surroundings in Dublin who are attending university with those in rural Ireland, who may have very small incomes and perhaps a maintenance grant. Those people find it impossible to survive. We have had the same level of grants for the past number of years. A major change is required in this area. I read a report in the newspaper today to the effect that many people refused third level places because they could not afford to attend university, even if they were availing of a maintenance grant, due to the rising cost of rented accommodation in Dublin. That is a terrible reflection on us at a time like this and it is a problem that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I come from a rural constituency where agriculture plays an important role in the incomes of the people in my county. We had a particularly good period in the 1990s when income gain was in excess of 21%, but problems have been experienced in the past three years. While I acknowledge the effort being made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to improve the lot of agriculture, serious problems remain to be addressed. He has introduced certain measures in the budget, for which I am grateful, but the sheep trade is currently very poor and there has been a significant slump in most of the agricultural enterprises. We must ensure that farm incomes are supplemented. Many people are earning off-farm incomes. We cannot prevent that but the Government, the local authorities and the various State agencies must become aware of the fact that rural development is in serious decline. While I welcome the publication of the White Paper on Rural Development by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, I have serious concerns about that area.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the planning process earlier. It never ceases to amaze me that at Government level, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, we have a fine paper in the White Paper for Rural Development while at the same time local authorities, through the planning process, are ensuring that nobody can get planning permission to live in a rural area. That is difficult to understand. The local authorities are running people out of their own parishes into the town and cities which are already overcrowded. There is traffic congestion, problems with the cost of housing, acquiring sites and other social problems, yet this seems to be the official policy of local authorities throughout the country. That cannot continue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to tourism and sport, matters close to my heart. I am anxious that increased funding would be made available for a recreational facilities scheme. We should provide additional funding and this should be done on a three year basis where clubs and organisations would be able to avail of grants. I am aware of the difficulties in drawing down moneys but a three year plan would certainly improve that.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is an excellent budget that unfor<Col N="1382" /> tunately got lost in the various controversies which arose over the past number of weeks. People reacted to what they saw was the effect the budget would have on their particular patch rather than the overall scene. Obviously it was a golden opportunity for the Opposition, who had dreaded budget day like never before, and who had to find some reason to knock what was a particularly good budget. They were supported in that approach by certain individuals who went over the top when dealing with the media.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this matter. I am conscious of the important day for the Naval Service tomorrow with the launch of the<i> LE Roisin</i> and wish everyone the best.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks a survey has detected white asbestos in the machinery spaces in certain items, the engines, exhausts and manifold lagging, on four of the older vessels of the Naval Service fleet, the <i>LE Deirdre</i>, <i>LE Emer</i>, <i>LE Aoife</i> and<i> LE Aishling</i>. Obviously, as a matter of urgency, this asbestos must be removed from these ships. I ask the Minister to outline to the House how he believes the Naval Service will be able to maintain its duties on fisheries protection, drug interdiction and search and rescue when this number of current vessels will be out of service while the asbestos is removed from them.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service on any island nation is vital on many fronts. The Naval Service of a nation on the periphery of a united Europe at the beginning of a new century is unique. The Naval Service has until now had seven vessels to patrol 132,000 square miles of water, 16 per cent of EU marine territory. This does not include Ireland's marine designated area which extends our economic interest to 260,000 square miles. The vessel concentration at present is one ship per 18,857 square miles or one ship per 32,142 square miles if the full marine designated area is considered. As we know, this compares most unfavourably with our EU neighbours. The Naval Service is clearly under-resourced for the tasks expected of it. It is a great shame that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the future of the Naval Service has not been implemented in full to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that removal of the vessels from the service is akin in some ways to declaring a free for all in Irish waters for foreign fishermen and those attempting to import drugs illegally. It raises questions about the safety of the Irish fishing fleet at one of the most dangerous times of the year when the search and rescue capabilities of the Naval Service are traditionally in great demand. The recent storms have illustrated once again the vulnerability of <Col N="1383" /> many working on our seas. I pay tribute to the Naval Service for the work it does on an ongoing basis and the Air Corps, particularly in the area of search and rescue.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline to the House what he believes the implications of this asbestos discovery are for the crews who have served on the affected vessels over the years and whether there are health implications? Will the current shortages limit patrolling of the seas and over what period of time? It is unfortunate that yet another difficulty has emerged at a time when there are severe difficulties facing the Naval Service. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on the impact on service in the coming weeks and how quickly the Naval Service will be able to get back to the full protection work it has done so effectively in such difficult circumstances during the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this debate. Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I wish the Minister and the personnel in the Naval Service well tomorrow on what will be a great occasion, the launch of the new vessel.</P>
      <P>The disclosure last week that more than half the fleet has been forced into port as a result of asbestos safety problems is the latest in a series of blows inflicted on the men and women of the Naval Service. Morale among personnel is already very low due to failure of the Government to deal with the fundamental problems facing the service. Even at the best of times, there have been problems keeping a sufficient number of vessels at sea. Earlier this year there were reports that ten personnel were leaving the service every month. The Government has failed to act on the recommendations of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that there should be additional funding for the service and that staff numbers should be increased to 1,144.</P>
      <P>In September the second most senior officer in the service, speaking on his retirement, said the service has been left waiting for Godot in relation to its future. He expressed serious disappointment at the Government's failure to accept in good faith the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and accused it of burying parts of the report it did not like. The fact such a senior officer felt it necessary to make such comments is an indication of the seriousness of the situation in the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>It is not as if we do not understand the importance of the Naval Service in the three main roles it carries out on our behalf, fishery protection, anti-drug patrols and rescue operations. An estimated £2 billion worth of fish are caught in Irish waters by foreign vessels. Clashes between marauding foreign vessels and Irish trawlers are too common. We have one of the most vulnerable coastlines in Europe and the successes of the Naval Service and the customs in intercepting drug consignments is believed to represent only a fraction of what gets through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> Each time there is a storm and a fishing boat or merchant ship gets into trouble it is the Naval Service which is called to go to the rescue. Despite one of the largest territorial waters in the EU, we have one of the smallest naval services. One officer writing in <i>An Cosantóir</i> said that with just seven vessels, it is like the Garda trying to patrol the whole country with one patrol car.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is inexcusable that a situation should have been allowed to develop which has seen more than half the fleet forced into port. I understand only three vessels are operational and only one has helicopter capacity and is capable of extended patrols. This means we are relying on a single vessel to patrol 400,000 square miles of sea. It is all the more surprising that this crisis should have arisen as a result of problems with asbestos. The danger of asbestos has been well known for decades.</P>
    <P>For how long was the Department aware that asbestos had been used in the construction of these vessels and why was nothing done before now? Why were members of the Naval Service left vulnerable to exposure to asbestos? What steps were taken to protect members of the service and to determine if the health of Naval Service personnel has been damaged? What medical advice or assistance has been made available to them? Why was there not a planned withdrawal of vessels to allow the problem to be dealt with in a phased manner? Why has the situation been allowed to drift until we have reached a disastrous situation? Who is responsible for leaving our fishermen and coastlines virtually defenceless? This situation cannot be allowed to drift on. Measures must be taken to have the asbestos removed and the ships returned to sea as soon as possible, or the question of acquiring replacement vessels, even on a short-term basis, must be urgently considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Fitzgerald and Wall for giving me the opportunity to set the record straight on this issue. The Naval Service continues to patrol while the issue of asbestos on four of the service's eight vessels is tackled as a matter of priority. The Air Corps also provides very valuable assistance to the fisheries enforcement regime by the use of the two CASA aircraft which to date this year have flown 217 patrols and recorded 5,800 sightings of fishing vessels. I will preside at the commission of the<i> LE Roisin </i>at the naval base tomorrow. This vessel will enhance considerably the effectiveness of the Naval Service in its fishery enforcement and other roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to set the record straight on the PricewaterhouseCoopers review. When the review was completed I asked the Naval Service to provide me with its plan. I gave it three months and I expected to receive it in January 1999. I only received the plan a few weeks ago. It is not consistent, fair or truthful for Opposition Deputies to suggest there was a delay on my part when I gave the plan to the Naval Service to pro<Col N="1385" /> vide its own implementation plan, which I am considering and will implement without any great delay.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the matter of asbestos being found on certain Naval Service ships is being taken extremely seriously by me and my Department and everything will be done in line with health and safety requirements to resolve the issue and return the Naval Service ships to their duties as soon as possible. The asbestos problem came to light as a result of a survey of older vessels of the Naval Service fleet which it was decided to carry out on the return of a Naval Service officer from attendance at a recent environmental seminar organised by the Health and Safety Authority. A firm of environmental consultants, McAllister Devereux Keating, was appointed on 14 October 1999 and <i>LE Deirdre</i> was the first ship surveyed. The results of the survey became available on 12 November 1999 and showed that chrysotile, white asbestos, was detected in very small quantities in isolated machinery spaces on certain items, such as engine exhausts, heating pipes and manifold lagging. I emphasise that no asbestos was detected in the accommodation areas. Due to the high degree of commonality of equipment among the four ships of the offshore patrol vessel, or OPV, class it was suspected that similar results would be likely in the other three ships. Subsequent surveys of these ships &ndash;<i>LE Emer</i>, <i>LE Aoife</i> and <i>LE Aisling</i>&ndash; confirmed this to be the case.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the results of the survey the consultants were further engaged to prepare a tender specification for the safe removal and disposal of all the hazardous material from the four ships. That specification was received by my Department on Tuesday last week and, by use of emergency tendering procedures, was immediately issued to four reputable contractors. The contractors were requested to view each of the four ships in Haulbowline in order to see at first hand the scope of the work. The viewing took place yesterday afternoon and the consultants were available to brief the four contractors in detail. The contractors are responding as quickly as possible to my Department's request for quotations and expect to be in a position to submit a tender price for the work involved within the next day or so at the latest. I hope to award a contract immediately for the carrying out of the work, or indeed a number of contracts if this would expedite the resolution of the matter.</P>
    <P>Following yesterday's viewing of the ships by the contractors, it is estimated that it will take no more than two or three days per ship to remove the asbestos. I am informed that all the contractors are in a position to commence work immediately they receive clearance from the Health and Safety Authority. There is a legal requirement for contractors involved in the removal of such hazardous material to be cleared by the Health and <Col N="1386" /> Safety Authority and my Department is in contact with the authority in order to expedite this clearance.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputies' concern regarding the unavoidable curtailment of the ability of the Naval Service to undertake its fishery protection tasks to the fullest extent which has resulted from the withdrawal of the ships from service in order to clear the asbestos problem. However, patrol days lost have not been exclusively due to the asbestos problem, as three of the four ships now in port were brought in to undergo periods of maintenance which arise normally in the course of service. The effect of the asbestos problem on the availability of these ships for patrol to date is minimal. For example, <i>Le Aisling</i> returned to port on 4 December for maintenance which is due to continue until 17 December. I assure the Deputies of three things. First, that the health and safety of Naval Service personnel is paramount, second, that the necessary works to remove the asbestos will be carried out as a matter of urgency and, third, that these Naval Service ships will return to patrolling duties at the first opportunity. Rescheduling of existing resources will take place to ensure that an adequate level of coverage will continue until all ships resume normal operations. As I said, expert contractors have been on site to assess the extent of the remedial work needed and I expect that this will be under way very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. For some time I have been making representations to Cavan County Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the need to provide a sewerage scheme in Stradone village. The preliminary report is with the Department at present for approval to enable the project to proceed to contract document stage and I am anxious that approval is given at the earliest possible date and that the project advances to tender stage as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>Stradone village is six miles east of Cavan town and is an obvious area for development. However, such development is contingent on the provision of basic infrastructure. The Chair will be aware that villages in the hinterland of county towns develop and a vigorous policy must be pursued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure that villages and smaller towns have the basic infrastructure to enable housing and other developments to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are aware that a spread of housing development is necessary to aid rural regeneration and renewal. It also relieves pressures on the housing market in urban areas. Since June 1997 the Government has invested substantially <Col N="1387" /> in sewerage and water schemes and the national development plan, which will come into effect in January, will show a record level of investment in such schemes. This investment is necessary to enable housing, social and economic development to take place.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government introduced a specific scheme for investment in water and sewerage schemes in smaller towns and villages. That was most welcome and will be one of the most beneficial schemes ever introduced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Chair will be aware that we in Cavan were fortunate that the Minister for Environment and Local Government approved sewerage schemes in Lough Gowna and Redhills under that scheme. That investment will protect the environment in those villages and enable further development to take place.</P>
    <P>Stradone village is in the parish of Laragh, which has a particularly active community spirit. The Laragh Area Development Group Limited has progressed a proposal to provide eight housing units under the Government's voluntary housing scheme. That scheme is actively promoted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. I compliment the Laragh Area Development Group on its initiative in providing much needed housing on a voluntary basis. That group also has a proposal for a major refurbishment of Stradone community centre. These developments will be progressed much quicker with the provision of the basic infrastructure &ndash; the sewerage scheme. Fianna Fáil Councillor Gerry Murray and other Fianna Fáil organisation members in that parish have constantly highlighted the need for this scheme and they have also pointed out the potential of Stradone for development, from both a public and private housing perspective.</P>
    <P>Rural regeneration is particularly contingent on the development of smaller towns and villages. We will have rural renewal with vibrant villages, but it is necessary that the basic infrastructure is put in place in villages where many services are already in place, such as primary schools, post offices, shops and churches. This is a wonderful opportunity for the Government and local authorities to have a proper spread of housing development when the basic infrastructure is provided in small towns and villages. I hope the Minister of State can convey my wishes and those of Deputy O'Hanlon that this scheme should be progressed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="1388" /> Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I will convey Deputy Brendan Smith's views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The provision of a modern environmental infrastructure to support our economic objectives and successes is a high priority for the Government. This has and continues to be well demonstrated by the current huge level of investment in the water and sanitary services programme throughout the country. This year the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced a capital programme of £275 million, which represented an increase of 50% on 1998 and is double the 1996 level.</P>
      <P>Cavan has benefited substantially in recent years from the water services programme. Work has begun on the Cootehill sewerage scheme at an estimated cost of £2.8 million and the Bailieborough extension to the Virginia water supply scheme costing £4.2 million is expected to reach construction in January 2000. Work costing £2.4m is continuing on the Ballyjamesduff sewerage scheme and the Ballyjamesduff water scheme is also in progress at an estimated cost of £8 million. The Belturbet sewerage scheme has been cleared to advance through planning at an estimated cost of £2.6 million. This year Lough Gowna village and Redhills benefited from the approval of sewerage schemes costing a total of £1.2 million under the rural towns and villages initiative, which is targeted at promoting development of smaller settlements and combating rural depopulation. The Minister has also provided funding for three schemes under the serviced land initiative, which will produce more than 1,800 housing sites throughout the county. It is evident from this, that a significant extent of water services infrastructure activity is currently taking place in Cavan.</P>
      <P>Stradone sewerage scheme is not yet included in the Department of Environment and Local Government's water and sewerage services investment programme and will be considered in the context of the new National Development Plan 2000&ndash;2006. Under the plan, spending will be trebled on these services to almost £3 billion over the next seven years in comparison to the current national development plan. In this context, each local authority was requested last year to carry out an assessment of needs for capital works in its area and to submit a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment to the Department of Environment and Local Government. A sewerage scheme for Stradoe has been identified by Cavan County Council as part of this process and is number 11 on its priority list. It will be taken into consideration on that basis by the Department when the next investment programme is being prepared early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State with responsibility for this area for coming into the House to reply to this matter, given that it is late and Ministers with responsibility for areas do not always come into the House to respond to matters when they are raised.</P>
      <P>I tabled a number of questions on this matter. I hope the Minister of State does not have the standard reply from Bus Éireann because I take exception to it. That reply states that it does not provide a service to the houses in question and that the road concerned is no more dangerous than any other road in the country. We are not seeking anything new. All we want is for the bus to collect the children at the original pick-up point. I ask the Minister of State, as Minister with responsibility for this area, to order Bus Éireann to collect children at the original bus point as there was not any reason to change it.</P>
      <P>I take exception to the reference in the standard reply that the road concerned is no more dangerous than any other road in the country. It is not so long ago since a child was killed not far from that road and it is a dangerous stretch of road. It is wrong in 1999 that primary school children aged seven and ten should have to walk a third of a mile every morning to a bus pick-up point. Weatherwise, today was bad. We are in the middle of winter and these children have to leave home early in the morning and do not get back until late in the evening. They are not seeking anything new. They are not asking the Minister of State to provide a service that would incur any extra cost.</P>
      <P>Why was the original pick-up point changed when there was not a reason to change it? I ask the Minister of State to instruct Bus Éireann to revert to the original pick-up point. The parents of these children are paying for the service and all they ask is that the original service be restored.</P>
      <P>The Department should not change any existing pick-up points or runs until the Minister of State and the Department carry out a review of the transport infrastructure. If the Minister will not accede to my request, I will ask the Ombudsman to investigate this case because there was not a reason to change the pick-up point. The Garda in County Mayo were concerned during recent months about strange men travelling around in cars offering children sweets to entice them into their cars. It is dangerous and wrong that these children should have to walk to the new pick-up point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost Christmas week. I am not asking the Minister to be Santa Claus but to be fair. I ask him to telephone Bus Éireann tomorrow morning to request it to revert to the original pick-up point, which is no different from what it did two years ago. I hope the Minister of State can show that he is kind and understanding and that he is not willing to take that standard type <Col N="1390" /> answer from Bus Éireann when there was not any reason to change the original pick-up point. I ask him to be fair to these children and their families and ensure the bus reverts to stopping at the original pick-up point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to outline the position on school transport for pupils from the Derrada, Partry, Claremorris area to Partry national school.</P>
      <P>By way of general comment, I should explain some basic facts about the school transport scheme. Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 156,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country. My Department has responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money spent on this service. It does not come cheap. In 1998, the net cost to the State was in excess of £40 million.</P>
      <P>One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.</P>
      <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that any eligible child will not have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to a convenient pick-up point along the route. Home pick-ups are not and were never intended to be a feature of the school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>Safety is a priority in the operation of the school transport scheme. All routes are examined with regard to the suitability of the roads for the various types of vehicles used. Safe set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind. In the planning of routes, road conditions, traffic hazards and all other aspects of safety are considered. Services are monitored and, if conditions deteriorate or dangers arise, they are revised to ensure safety.</P>
      <P>My Department is required to ensure that the transport scheme is operated in the most effective and efficient way possible. School transport routes are organised on the basis of the number of eligible pupils offering for transport. This means that from time to time Bus Éireann is obliged to reorganise some transport services as the numbers increase or decrease.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has advised that the route was changed because there was an insufficient number of eligible pupils residing in the area. Bus Éireann considers that the pick-up point on the Toreen Road is as safe as any other pick-up point throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> As this is considered to be a reasonable and adequate level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme, the view in the Department is that it is the best we can offer. In view of what Deputy Ring said, I will reconsider <Col N="1392" /> it, check what Bus Éireann is saying and revert to the Deputy in writing.</P>

      <QRef>[26894/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): The completion of the arrangements on 2 December to bring into being the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and other institutions under the Good Friday Agreement has provided us with the most appropriate framework and foundation for the promotion of co-operation, including economic, between both parts of the island. In particular, the six implementation bodies and the six areas for co-operation, operating under the NSMC, will focus on maximising co-operation in accordance with the Agreement to the mutual benefit of both jurisdictions. All of the areas will be of a direct or indirect economic benefit to our peoples.</P>
    <P>The six implementation bodies have already started operating, albeit in some cases at reduced levels until their activities come up to full speed which in the main is expected to be in the first half of 2000. The bodies' functions are wide-ranging including trade and business development, inland waterways, aquaculture and marine matters, food safety and, of course, certain EU programmes. The six further areas of co-operation will be implemented through existing agencies North and South.</P>
    <P>These areas, like the six implementation bodies which were contained in the agreed statement by the office of the First and Deputy First Ministers, Designate, on 18 December 1998, and reiterated in the joint communique issued following yesterday's inaugural NSMC plenary meeting, specifically include transport, agriculture, education, health, environment and tourism. Yesterday's communique agreed that the question of additional sectoral formats will be agreed by the NSMC meeting in institutional format. In the context of further areas of co-operation beyond the above to be agreed between the two administrations at the NSMC, it is acknowledged that the energy sector is one of the areas where the greatest mutual benefit to our island economy might accrue from co-operation between the two jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I will have responsibility, under the NSMC in its relevant sectoral format, at which I will be representing the Irish Government, for the Special EU Programmes Body, along with my Northern Ireland Executive counterpart, Mr. Mark Durkan MLA, the Minister for Finance and Personnel. As the Deputy will be aware, the Special EU Programmes Body has taken over many of the func<Col N="1394" /> tions in relation to the management and development of the two major EU cross-Border programmes, INTERREG and Peace, which up to now had been managed by the Department of Finance and Personnel and my Department. The body will also be responsible for drafting the new INTERREG and Peace programmes, together with the Leader and Equal Community initiatives, and will have a significant role to play in the implementation of INTERREG and Peace and the cross-Border elements of the new Leader and Equal programmes.</P>
    <P>However, in my view the most important part of the EU body's remit is its role in relation to the common chapter which sets out the context of North-South co-operation within our respective development plans over the period of the next round of structural funding. The areas for co-operation agreed in the common chapter include not only those set out in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement but a range of actions across the wider socio-economic spectrum including health, education, infrastructure and information technology. The body is also charged with taking a more proactive approach to identifying constraints inhibiting full co-operation and it will report twice yearly on progress to my Department and its northern counterpart, and thence to the NSMC.</P>
    <P>It will be at the NSMC that individual Ministers will be sponsoring proposals to promote economic co-operation between the two economies North and South. I shall be pursuing this at the relevant sectoral format meetings. The Deputy might address questions relating to non-Finance areas to the respective Ministers if he wishes to pursue further details on the other sectors to which I referred above. The Deputy may be assured that the Government attaches the highest priority to the whole area of North-South co-operation and development, and I, with my Department, will be playing a full role in this.</P>

      <P>The Government agreed in February 1999 to a proposal from the boards of ACC and TSB for a merger and flotation. I appointed financial and legal advisers in May this year and they have, in conjunction with officials from my Department, the staff and management of both ACC and TSB Banks and their advisers, been working on the planning for the merger and flotation. The actual timing of the merger and the flotation depends on a number of factors including the final form taken by the business plan for the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I advised in answer to a previous question, ICC Bank, for which bids had been sought, has <Col N="1395" /> been withdrawn from the market for the present. I will now be asking the board, management and staff to consider the options for the future of ICC Bank in the light of current developments. I will consider all the options for a way forward on receipt of the views of these parties.</P>
    <P>As regards private sector sales, mergers or takeovers, the main statutory authorities to be consulted would be those responsible for takeovers and competition. This would be the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment at national level and the Commission at EU level. In the case of banking takeovers and partial acquisitions, additional provisions apply. Under Chapter VI of the Central Bank Act, 1989, an acquisition of more than 10% of the shares in a bank requires the approval of the Central Bank. Where the acquisition would result in the acquirer holding more than 20% of the total assets in the State of all licence holders, the consent of the Minister for Finance is required for any proposal approved by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may only consent to a proposal already approved by the Central Bank where,<i> inter alia</i>, he has consulted with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment where the proposed acquisition is such that it would come within the provisions of the mergers and takeover legislation. I have received no proposals seeking my consent under the relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are already a number of existing significant tax provisions which provide relief for charities. Under the tax code a body of persons or a trust which is established for charitable purposes only may be exempt from income tax, corporation tax, where the body is incorporated, deposit interest retention tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and probate tax. To qualify for the relief the body or trust must fall within four categories of charitable purpose. These are the advancement of religion, the advancement of education, the relief of poverty and other purposes beneficial to the community and not falling within the other three categories. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that there are about 5,000 active charitably exempt bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax relief for personal donations to designated third world charities was introduced in the Finance Act, 1995. The relief is available on personal donations of between £200 and £750 per annum. The relief is available at the standard rate of tax and goes to the designated charity rather than the <Col N="1396" /> donor. The relief was introduced to mark the 150th anniversary of the Famine and in recognition of the particular type and scale of the human tragedy that is encountered in the Third World. To date 19 charities have been designated for the relief.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1998, introduced a relief for companies who donate between £250 and £10,000</P>
    <P>to any one charity in any accounting period, subject to an annual limit of £50,000 or 10 per cent of a companies taxable income, whichever is the lesser amount.</P>
    <P>To qualify for the relief, the charity must satisfy a number of conditions, the most significant of which is that bodies should have been charitably exempt for at least three years. This was done to ensure the bodies applying for the relief had a proven track record.</P>
    <P>This relief was introduced along the lines suggested by the Irish Charities Tax Relief Group. I would like to make the point that when the tax relief for corporate donations to charities was originally sought it was on the strict understanding that it would not be extended to include personal donations. To date 374 bodies have been approved for the relief. I have no plans to extend the relief beyond its current scope.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, as Minister for Finance I receive numerous requests, many from very worthwhile causes, for the introduction of new or the extension of existing tax reliefs. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</P>

A detailed examination will be involved. Revenue advise me that it is not possible at this stage to speculate on what the outcome of the examination will be. However, the Revenue Commissioners assure me that they will be using all their powers in an effort to uncover whatever tax evasion is involved in the alleged tax evasion schemes and to take all appropriate measures in relation to them.</P>

      <P>I have attended two meetings of the ECOFIN Council since 10 November 1999. These were a formal meeting on 29 November 1999 and an informal meeting on 9 December 1999. The meeting on 29 November was followed by a joint ECOFIN-Labour and Social Affairs Council. The main focus of ECOFIN's agenda on 29 November 1999 was preparation for the European Council in Helsinki, particularly in respect of the EU tax package, economic policy co-ordination, and Commission reports on financial management.</P>
      <P>As regards the taxation package, Ministers had a discussion on the three elements of the taxation package, namely, the savings directive, the interest and royalties directive and the code of conduct. Arising out of this discussion, it was recognised that the savings directive presented the largest single obstacle to an agreement being reached. It was agreed that work to find a way of overcoming the main obstacle would be continued up to the Helsinki European Council, and the Presidency subsequently arranged for an informal meeting in Helsinki on 9 December to discuss the issue further.</P>
      <P>As regards economic policy co-ordination, Ministers approved a report to the Helsinki European Council. As regards financial management, Ministers took note of a presentation by Commissioner Schreyer both of the Commission's Annual Report on the Fight against Fraud in 1998 and its report on the work of the Personal Representatives Group on Sound Financial Management &ndash; the SEM 2000 initiative. In addition, Ministers took note of a presentation by the President of the Court of Auditors on the court's annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the year 1998.</P>
      <P>Ministers also agreed, following a recommendation by the Commission, on the abrogation of the decision concerning the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece. This reflects improvements in Greece's budgetary situation in recent years. Finally, Ministers considered a progress report by the Commission on the action plan for financial services, which is designed to ensure further progress towards a single market for financial services.</P>
      <P>Over lunch, discussion included a summary by the Presidency of the Euro-11 meeting held earlier that morning. The joint ECOFIN-Labour and Social Affairs Council meeting which followed the formal ECOFIN Council reached unanimous agreement on three texts comprising the 1999/2000 employment package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated above, the informal ECOFIN meeting on 9 December 1999 dealt solely with the issue of the savings directive as this element of the tax package requires specific attention in order to overcome the current impasse. Prior to the informal ECOFIN the presidency circulated a new document which addressed some of the <Col N="1398" /> concerns regarding the inclusion of eurobonds within the scope of the directive. The proposed solution sought to have a simplified system of information-reporting on the basis of existing national legislation, particularly the information which financial institutions gather under money laundering provisions.</P>
    <P>No agreement was reached at the informal meeting and the issue was sent forward for discussion at the European Council meeting on 10 December 1999. The European Council meeting has asked for further work to be done by a high level working group and for a report with possible solutions to be sent to the European Council in June 2000 at the latest.</P>

      <P>The tax status of purchases by schools of school equipment and supplies is governed by EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. The Sixth EU VAT Directive designates education as exempt for VAT purposes. Exempt bodies do not charge VAT for the service they provide, but as a necessary corollary, they cannot recover the VAT they pay on goods and services they purchase and use. Generally speaking, VAT can be recovered only by registered traders. It is not, therefore, open for me to provide for recovery of VAT by exempt bodies such as schools.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members, in sup<Col N="1399" /> port of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group.</P>
      <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. The EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid. I believe a key consideration, which influenced their decision, is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if dividends were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit, as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This is a point which complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the</P>
      <P>working group. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions. The differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving this matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the loss to the Exchequer as a result of tax evasion arising from off-shore accounts held by Irish citizens over the past 20 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to quantify the loss to the Irish Exchequer from tax evasion related to offshore accounts over the past 20 years. Offshore accounts held by Irish citizens for the purposes of tax evasion are very often held in tax haven jurisdictions. A distinguishing feature of tax havens is the active promotion of their secrecy laws, including bank secrecy, which have the effect of facilitating tax evasion and avoidance. Tax havens do not co-operate with other jurisdictions in tax matters and do not exchange information.</P>
      <P>Indeed, this problem is not confined to tax havens. Even within the EU, funds placed by non-resident depositors generally are not subject to tax at source in the country of deposit. The interest income would be subject to tax in the depositor's country of residence but, for the most part, information on the interest may not become available to the relevant tax authorities. Deputies will be aware that tax evasion within the EU in respect of interest and other savings income was one of the major issues discussed at the Helsinki summit last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> While information about the scale of the offshore tax evasion problem is not available, such information as has become known to the Revenue Commissioners, for example arising from the Ansbacher and National Irish Bank disclosures, is investigated to the fullest extent possible. No overall statistics are readily available regarding the total of tax recoveries from previous investigations but information about particular categories now under investigation will be made available in due course in an appropriate format. The investigations arising from recent disclosures are complex and, while they are being given priority, will take considerable time to complete. Information about National Irish Bank cases has already been published by the Revenue Commissioners in their annual report for 1998.</P>
    <P>Arising from my concerns to improve taxation compliance, I provided for certain measures which were enacted in the Finance Act 1999. These measures considerably strengthen the investigative powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to financial institutions and other parties. The new powers include provisions that enable the Revenue Commissioners to audit the DIRT returns of relevant deposit takers, to carry out on-site audits of financial institutions and to allow the Revenue Commissioners to seek from third parties information relevant to the tax liability of a person who is subject to enquiry. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have been empowered to apply to the courts for orders to seek information from financial institutions or other parties in relation to the tax liability of an individual. The Finance Act, 1999 also considerably strengthened the anti-avoidance provisions in the tax code relating to offshore trusts and companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures in question are not indicative of the current position since they relate to income arising in the year ended 5 April 1997. For the 1999-2000 tax year, it is estimated that the number of self-employed tax units, including proprietary directors, with gross incomes above £30,000 is of the order of 76,000 or about 27% of the total The corresponding figure for PAYE taxpayers, excluding proprietary directors, is 172,900, representing just under 15% of the total. Proprietary directors are basically self-employed persons who have incorporated their businesses, with themselves as employee-directors, and although paying tax on their salaries under PAYE, are more akin to the self-employed than to ordinary wage and salary earners. It should also be borne in mind that not all the self-employed have large incomes; there would be a large proportion of individuals in this class with low incomes, for example, smaller farmers, small shopkeepers, low investment incomes and so on.</P>
      <P>An integral part of the self-assessment system applying to the self-employed is the audit programme, under which taxpayers' returns and accounts are examined either by way of desk audit or field audit to ensure proper declaration of income and deductions. The great majority of cases who are selected for audit are selected on the basis of perceived defects in their tax returns and not on a random basis. This means that most cases are chosen for audit following a risk analysis which may suggest the possibility of incorrect returns for any of the taxes. Selection of cases on this basis has proved to be very successful. There is also a small random element. The target for the number of random audits is being reviewed at present. These comprehensive self-assessment audits are in addition to normal employers PAYE and VAT audits. Approximately 1% of income tax returns are subject to comprehensive audit annually; when PAYE/PRSI, relevant contracts tax and VAT audits are included, audit coverage is approximately 6% of the self employed taxpayer base.</P>
      <P>In addition to audits, revenue is increasingly charging penalty interest on those who do not pay</P>
      <P>their tax on time. In 1998 there were 2,295 prosecutions of self-employed taxpayers for failure to</P>
      <P>file returns.</P>
      <P>In general, the scope and extent of the compliance and audit programmes reflects Revenue's</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>professional assessment from year to year of where tax is most at risk and where resources <Col N="1402" /> might therefore be devoted to best effect. The Revenue Commissioners are continuing with their overall approach in order, on the one hand, to make procedures easier for those who are trying to meet their tax obligations and, on the other, to pursue people who do not pay on time or at all, using the various powers available to them. I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are doing all they can to ensure that the self-employed meet their tax obligations. In this regard however, the Deputy will recall that I mentioned in my Budget Statement that I have acted already to provide the Revenue Commissioners with more specialist resources and I am now considering further requests which the commissioners have recently put to me in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Government decided in March 1997 to establish a system of expenditure reviews with the aim of reviewing all areas of expenditure over a three year period. This decision implemented one of the key financial and managerial reforms under the strategic management initiative.</P>
      <P>The introduction of multi-annual budgeting under the strategic management initiative will give Departments greater scope to manage their programmes over the medium-term within the financial allocations or envelopes decided by the Government. The expenditure review process is designed to support this important change. By establishing the review system as a regular part of their annual cycle of work, Departments will be in a much better position to ensure that the resources at their disposal are used as efficiently and effectively as possible. The reviews are carried out by the spending Departments under the aegis of joint steering groups from the spending Departments and the Department of Finance. In addition, a high level steering committee for programme evaluation was established to oversee the process and to provide an independent assessment of completed reviews.</P>
      <P>In July 1997, the Government approved the first tranche of spending reviews by all major Departments and offices to be started in 1997. The Government also considered an indicative list of the reviews which might be begun in the second and third years of the programme. Progress with the reviews was slower than anticipated. However, the 1997-98 round of reviews is almost completed at this stage. In March 1999 the Government approved the second round of spending reviews to be undertaken in 1999-2000.

      <P>So far this year headline inflation, CPI, has been in the range 1.2-1.6%. However, this understates underlying inflationary pressures in the economy because the headline rate has been depressed by mortgage interest rate cuts since late 1998. Excluding mortgage interest rates, the average inflation rate this year has been 2.6%. As the mortgage interest rate reductions in late 1998 and early 1999 drop out of the year-on-year comparison, the headline rate can be expected to rise significantly and to converge towards the underlying rate. Headline inflation is expected to be in the region of 3.5% in the early months of 2000.</P>
      <P>The increase in excise on tobacco products in the budget will add approximately 0.75% to the headline inflation rate for 2000. This measure is part of the Government's strategy to encourage people to cut down or give up smoking and so reduce the incidence of tobacco related illnesses.</P>
      <P>Transport and fuel and light costs have risen substantially since March reflecting the doubling in crude oil prices resulting from supply cuts by OPEC and the fall in the euro against the US dollar. However, inflation is forecast to moderate in the second half of next year for a number of reasons &ndash; the distorting effects of mortgage interest rate changes will become less important, oil prices appear to have peaked and food prices are expected to continue their recent fall in response to improved supply conditions. The impetus to prices of the euro's decline this year will also fall out of the calculations. As a result the headline rate is forecast to fall to about 2.5% in the second half of 2000, resulting in an annual average of about 3% for the year. The pace of price increases should continue to abate thereafter. Ireland's updated Stability Programme 2000-2002 projects average inflation of 2.25% for 2001 and 2% for 2002.</P>
      <P>As a small open economy, inflation in Ireland is to a greater extent than elsewhere externally determined. However, domestic inflationary pressures, particularly in the services and construction sectors, remain a cause for concern. It is essential that domestic cost increases be kept to a minimum, both to enhance the value of incomes increases and to maintain Ireland's competitiveness and growth potential.</P>

      <P>The officials in my Department, in partnership with the Civil Service unions, are in the process of <Col N="1404" /> drafting a new equal opportunity policy for the Civil Service which will reflect the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The new Act extends the prohibition on discrimination in employment to nine grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. Work on drafting the new policy is at an advanced stage and should be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The current equal opportunity policy and guidelines were published in 1986 and were based on the legislation existing at that time. They were aimed at the elimination of discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status, as well as the promotion of equal opportunity between men and women. However, in the light of the recent report on gender imbalance at higher grades in the Civil Service, the Government has recently approved a package of measures to promote gender equality. A high-level management equality group has been established to develop a new gender equality policy and framework programme of affirmative action for the Civil Service, in accordance with the best standards of equal opportunity practices. Work is proceeding on the development of this new policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very much alive to the need for a continued expansion of construction capacity to ensure the delivery in a timely and cost-effective manner of the infrastructure envisaged in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The Government, in partnership with the domestic <Col N="1405" /> building industry, has already taken steps to secure an expansion in the capacity of the industry. The industry has already more than doubled its intake of apprentices &ndash; from 2,300 in 1993-94 to 5,600 in 1999-2000. Steps have also been taken to expand the manpower base of the industry by attracting workers from the UK and other countries. No problems are currently foreseen in ensuring that there will be adequate supplies of building materials and plant.</P>
      <P>Moreover, there is every prospect that the commitment to the major programme of infrastructure in the NDP, particularly the larger projects in the-roads, water services and solid waste areas, will attract greater participation by firms from other countries in the design and construction of projects and, in this manner, will help to expand building capacity. In this context, public private partnership can also act as a mechanism for enhancing capacity to deliver key projects, by harnessing a wider range of private sector technical, financial and management skills as well as additional financial resources.</P>
      <P>Finally, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has asked the Forum for the Construction Industry, which represents all interests in the industry, to expedite a study of the capacity of the industry. I understand that the forum will submit an interim report and recommendations before the end of this year and a final report and recommendations by mid-2000.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers about sums of money lying unclaimed in life assurance companies in respect of matured policies for which no beneficiary can be found.</P>
      <P>In relation to dormant bank accounts, the Deputy may recall from my response to his previous question on this issue, on 10 November last, that the formulation of policy proposals to tackling this issue is currently in hand in my Department. It will be necessary to consult with the banking and insurance industry and my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has responsibility for the insurance sector. When these proposals have been finalised, I will be submitting a memorandum to Government.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy that banks, and indeed insurance companies, should make greater</P>
      <P>efforts to trace the owners of unclaimed moneys. I understand that in the UK, banks and life assurance companies have themselves recently come up with proposals for a register of unclaimed policies and accounts to help beneficiaries track down such assets and I would like to see the industry doing the same here.</P>
      <P>As to the situation in Ireland, I understand that banks, where they become aware of the death of a customer, endeavour to draw the attention of the next of kin to the existence of a bank account. I also understand that banks provide a service for the personal representatives of deceased persons, which enables the whole of the bank's network to be checked, to help them find any accounts in the name of the deceased person. Irish banks have also issued an information leaflet on dormant accounts which is available in all bank branches.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the cross-departmental team which is mentioned in chapter 4 of the national development plan as supporting the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development, including Public Private Partnership.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Taoiseach's reply of 30 November 1999 to a number of questions regarding the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development, including Public Private Partnership, in which he stated that this committee. which he chairs, includes the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance, Public Enterprise, Environment and Local Government, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Attorney General. The general purpose of the committee is to oversee the delivery of key infrastructure in the context of the NDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> The cross-departmental team which assists the Cabinet committee is drawn from these Departments. The team's terms of reference are to develop and oversee the implementation of a framework for action on infrastructure and, in particular, to bring forward proposals to deal with planning approval issues to reduce delays in the delivery of infrastructure. The team has held eleven meetings to date. During the summer, the team produced the &ldquo;Framework for Action on Infrastructural Development, including Public Private Partnership&rdquo; which was approved by the Cabinet committee in September and, subsequently, by the Government. The key elements of this framework have been included in the NDP and copies of the framework itself were laid before the House on 24 November. In addition, I have established a special unit in my Department to drive the delivery of the infrastructure investment programme in the NDP. This unit is working in close co-operation with the crossdepartmental team.</P>
    <P>The team is currently working on advancing the proposals in the framework for action and will be reporting regularly to the Cabinet committee. I believe that the work of the Cabinet committee and the supporting cross-departmantal team will have a real impact on the timely and efficient delivery of the key infrastructural investment in the NDP.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank has not issued any millennium £1 coins and will not do so until January 2000. I presume that the coins to which the Deputy refers are the £1 coins dated 1999. My attention has been drawn to problems experienced by Dublin Corporation's pay and display parking meters in accepting some 1999 dated £1 coins.</P>
      <P>When the Central Bank was made aware of the problems experienced by Dublin Corporation, it carried out detailed re-testing of the coins. The tests confirmed that the coins met the specifications for £1 coins, as laid down in the Decimal Currency Act, 1990. These technical specifications include the diameter and the design, the weight and standard composition including remedy allowances or tolerances. The technical specifications of the 1999 £1 coin are identical to those of all previous £1 coin issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Central Bank that further tests have shown that some 1999 dated coins are readily accepted by the pay and display <Col N="1408" /> parking meters while other coins are accepted only after several attempts. I also understand that the Central Bank is in contact with Dublin Corporation regarding the method of calibrating the corporation's parking meters with a view to finding a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Regarding the £1 millennium coins to be issued early next year, the Central Bank informs me that, in accordance with normal procedures when a new coin is being issued, it will facilitate testing of these coins for machine calibration purposes before they are issued.</P>

      <P>The objective of the strategy and investment proposals set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is to secure sustainable economic and social development. The plan is designed to strike the correct balance between protecting and preserving the environment, promoting economic and employment growth, improving competitiveness and addressing  social exclusion. Many of the investments provided for are specifically designed to have a positive impact on the environment such, as for example, £3.6 billion investment in improving water and waste management services, over £2.5 billion investment in public transport and substantial other investment in <Col N="1409" /> areas such as the rural environment protection scheme and in forestry.</P>
      <P>Chapter 13 of the plan contains an analysis of the environmental situation in Ireland. In line with the Government's policy to introduce eco-auditing the plan was subjected to a pilot eco-audit, details of which are set out at appendix 4 of the plan. The chapters in the plan dealing with the various operational programmes contain a summary of how they will impact on the environment as well as on equal opportunity, poverty and rural development. The plan provides that at operational level, the environment and these other horizontal concerns will, where feasible, be included in the development of all project selection criteria, performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation arrangements. An environmental co-ordinating committee to monitor and oversee the implementation of the plan from an environmental perspective is also provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 194 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is treating the year 2000 problem with the utmost urgency and priority and has been taking steps since 1996 to ensure that information technology systems and other office equipment and plant will not be affected. In the public sector, it adopted a three-stranded approach to the year 2000 problem, i.e., remedy the problem in computer systems, infrastructures, equipment, plant and information exchanges; prepare business continuity and contingency plans for all business-critical operations; and co-ordinate emergency management arrangements.</P>
      <P>Each Government Department and office is individually responsible for ensuring that it, and the public bodies under its aegis, achieves year 2000 compliance in good time. Based on a detailed circular and advice note issued by my Department, all Departments/offices put comprehensive year 2000 programmes in place. In addition, monitoring, and reporting processes m-ere put in place in each Department and office to ensure that these programmes were properly, managed and progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, the Government established an interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment and plant in Civil Service Departments and offices. In that context, this committee does not have a remit to monitor the achievement of year 2000 compliance in public sector bodies. The committee is chaired by my Department and is made up of four private sector representatives and eight civil servants at principal officer level. My Department also provides a full-time secretariat to the committee. The committee reports through me to the Government. It did this on a two-monthly basis to September of this year and has been doing it monthly since then. All Departments/offices have completed all business-critical year 2000 projects. The Government's <Col N="1411" /> year 2000 web site has been updated to reflect this progress.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, Departments and offices are individually responsible for ensuring that public bodies operating under their aegis achieve year 2000 compliance in good time. Each Department/office with public bodies has individual monitoring committees overseeing this work which report regularly on progress to their senior management and Minister. Five Departments/ offices &ndash; Education and Science; Environment and Local Government; Health and Children; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Public Enterprise &ndash; report, through their Minister, on progress in these sectors to Government every two months. These Departments have reported that all public bodies have completed the bulk of year 2000 compliance work. The Government's year 2000 web site provides links to the year 2000 information published by many public sector bodies. All of the public bodies operating under the aegis of my Department have completed their year 2000 compliance programmes.</P>
    <P>On the instructions of Government, all Departments, offices and public sector bodies have developed year 2000 business contingency and staff cover plans to deal with any contingencies which may arise before, during, or after the millennium changeover period. These plans were subjected to independent audits. In the remaining time, Departments, offices, and public bodies are concentrating on training, and familiarising staff, completing, preparations, and testing,/rehearsing/refining their contingency plans.</P>
    <P>The national year 2000 emergencies coordination committee was established by the Government to oversee and co-ordinate the year 2000 contingency preparations and emergency management arrangements of the key national utility, infrastructure, health. security, financial and business sectors, so as to mitigate potential disruptions to Irish society in the event of problems arising, from year 2000 related incidents and/or millennium celebrations. The committee is representative of the business and financial sectors and Government Departments that provide the vital services necessary to our society and our economy. The committee has reviewed and is satisfied with the general state of readiness of the sectors and the information co-ordination and emergency management arrangements between them. The committee's work is still in progress with a view to ensuring that any disruptions that might arise will have minimum effects.</P>
    <P>Private sector companies are individually responsible for ensuring that they achieve compliance in good time. To raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance on solving it to the private sector, the Department of Enterprise. Trade and Employment, set up an extensive business awareness campaign.   In this regard, it established a year 2000 campaign committee, chaired by Deputy Noel Treacy, Minister of State <Col N="1412" /> with responsibility for Science, Technology and Commerce, and enlisted representatives from a wide range of businesses and business development agencies. This committee has issued a comprehensive guidance brochure to approximately 150,000 businesses; contributed to the production of a TV programme and video on the matter; held a number of national and regional conferences and seminars; and supported Enterprise Ireland in establishing a year 2000 information service which is provided free of charge and includes a helpline phone number, an information pack, an Internet website, a directory of year 2000 service suppliers, and training workshops.</P>
    <P>I am, satisfied that the Government has taken all necessary-steps in relation to the year 2000 problem and that the civil and public service are prepared to deal with any issues which may arise. It is worth noting that, as a result of the efforts set out above and the work completed to date, Ireland is rated at the best state of readiness by, among others, the United Nations, European Union, the OECD, and the Global 2000 Co-ordinating Group.</P>

      <P>This chapter is common to the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for Ireland and to its Northern Ireland equivalent. It seeks to set out a strategic framework for building on and developing economic co-operation between both parts of the island. In doing so it has built extensively on the framework of co-operation set out in the common chapter provisions of the current national development plan and taken full account of the areas of co-operation set out under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. The drafting of the Common Chapter was entrusted to the relevant officials in my Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland. They engaged in a wide-ranging series of bilateral consultations with the sectoral departments and other relevant socio-economic interest groups. This consultation process included a specific conference involving relevant departments North and South, held in Enniskillen in September last.</P>
      <P>The two finance Departments were in daily contact throughout the entire drafting period, and I understand that the Deputy's party featured among those briefed on progress during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promotion and implementation of the Common Chapter provisions are now the responsibility of the Special EU Programmes Body set up <Col N="1413" /> under the Good Friday Agreement and established since 2 December 1999.</P>

      <P>My Department's latest estimate for Gross Domestic Product for 1999 is £66.8 billion compared with Gross National Product of £58.2 billion, a difference of £8.6 billion or 13% of GDP. This compares to a gap of £7.5 billion in 1998 which was equivalent to 12.5% of GDP.</P>
      <P>The difference between GNP and GDP consists of a number of items, the most important of which are profit repatriations of foreign owned companies and interest payments on the foreign held components of the national debt.</P>
      <P>The increase in the difference between GNP and GDP in recent years is indicative of the success this country has had in attracting foreign direct investment. The bulk of this investment is in high-tech, high-productivity and export-oriented industries which have transformed manufacturing industry in Ireland. It reflects the competitiveness of the Irish economy which has underpinned the strong economic growth over the last decade. One of the key challenges is to maintain competitiveness and our attractiveness for FDI.</P>

      <P>Under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, qualifying lessee specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant. The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
      <P>There are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 1 April 1999 there were 743 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.7% of the total staff. My Department has 3.5% of staff with disabilities. My officials are currently in the process of gathering the figures for 1 October 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the number of people with disabilities across the Civil Service generally has dropped below the target of 3% continues to be a cause of concern. The heads of each Depart<Col N="1415" /> ment and office have been made fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% quota.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission recently announced an open recruitment competition for clerical officers for people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability. A panel of suitably qualified people will be established through this competition. Applicants will be facilitated by the provision of enlarged scripts, Braille and audio test material, interpreters for interviews, and wheelchair access to test and interview locations. As soon as a panel of qualified candidates becomes available for appointment, each head of Department will be encouraged to draw from that panel when recruiting clerical officers.</P>
    <P>The figure of 3% relates to the Civil Service as a whole. It is not always possible to ensure that each Department individually fulfils the 3% quota at all times. For example, the regular and ongoing movement of staff between Departments may impact on the quota at any given time. In addition, a number of positions across the Civil Service may not be as suited to those with certain types of disabilities. For practical reasons therefore, in monitoring the number of disabled staff, the aim at present is to achieve an overall quota of 3%.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to policy of equal opportunity which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>
    <P>Since 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has been in place. The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures. The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by committee representative of staff and management. In addition, in the context of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service, equality initiatives relating to the employment of people with disabilities are being developed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the year 2000 issue relates to <Col N="1416" /> the possibility that computer and electronic production systems will not recognise 2000 as a date and instead will read it as 1900 or some other date. It should be emphasised that this could potentially impact on businesses mainly, rather than on households or household appliances. Accordingly, a comprehensive business awareness campaign is being carried out to raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>As regards a checklist for households, earlier this year, ESB sent a customer care pack to every household in the country which included a leaflet on The Year 2000 and my Home &ndash; Useful facts. This suggested that appliances or electrical appliances such as personal computers, alarms systems, VCRS, office machines and electronic heating control systems might be impacted by year 2000, while home products unlikely to be affected would include fridges and freezers, cookers, washing machines, dishwashers etc. In any event, it suggested that if householders were worried about these appliances, they should contact the retailer or manufacturer of the equipment who should be able to give advice as to whether it is year 2000 compliant.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to set up a helpline on the lines suggested given the widespread publicity that there has been about the year 2000, the steps already taken, and range and variety of appliances involved. I reiterate that if households are concerned about any of their appliances or equipment, the best course of action they can follow is to contact the supplier or manufacturer of the product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unclear precisely what the Deputy means by the needs of the labour market. Viewed in the narrow sense of labour supply and demand, those needs are already being met in that current participation rates represent the response of potential workers generally, including female workers, to the terms and conditions which employers have seen fit to offer in response to the market opportunities facing them. Viewed in a broad socio-economic context, there is no demonstrably correct answer to the question as to whether present participation rates represent an ideal balance between the full range of societal concerns and aspirations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's female participation rate has increased sharply from 36.8% in 1992 to 46.0% in March-May 1999. A detailed breakdown of the <Col N="1417" /> latter figure, by age, is available in the latest quarterly national household survey.</P>
    <P>While future developments will reflect those broader societal concerns and aspirations, in the context of a projected falling trend in the unemployment rate, international experience suggests that female participation will continue to increase. In this connection, I refer the Deputy to the views expressed in the CSO's latest Population and Labour Force Projections published in July last. It states:</P>
    <P>There have been dramatic gains in the labour force participation rates of married females in the recent past. Notwithstanding these increases, Ireland still lags somewhat behind most countries of the EU in terms of the labour force participation rates of married females. It is therefore, assumed that the catching up process will continue largely through further increases in the participation rates of married females in the 25-59 age group. No major changes are projected in the participation rates of other females.</P>

      <P>As stated in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government aims to complete the implementation of the specific and ambitious aims as set out in the programme, through a balanced strategy of removing more of the low paid from the tax net altogether, by reducing tax rates and by ensuring that a large majority of taxpayers are subject to no more than the standard rate of tax.</P>
      <P>This budget has made significant inroads into achieving these aims, including the removal of low paid from the tax net altogether. The personal taxation measures announced on budget day will remove almost 50,000, including 10,000 elderly tax payers from the tax net. The £3,000 allowance for stay-at-home spouses which I announced on December 8 will remove a further 23,000 one earner married couples from the tax net, who would otherwise have been in the tax net, giving a total of some 73,000 taxpayers who will now be exempted from tax as a result of these measures. Over the course of the three budgets to date, 1998 to 2000, this Government will have removed almost 176,000 taxpayers from the tax net. This compares with a figure of 38,000 over the previous three budgets from 1995 to 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other budgetary measures of this Government, have reduced the burden of tax on the low paid, <Col N="1419" /> thereby increasing the incentive to take up employment. Personal allowances have been increased by £1,800 single-£3,600 married in the same period. The standard rating of the personal allowances in budget 1999 has equalised the benefit from the personal and PAYE allowances, thereby ensuring that those on lower incomes receive the same benefits as those on higher incomes.</P>
    <P>I intend to build on what has been achieved for the low paid in future budgets.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the views which have been expressed by Commissioner Prodi, when he recently suggested that the use of the veto by member states, including the area of taxation, would have to be considered in the context of future plans for enlargement. This issue is likely to arise at the <Col N="1420" /> forthcoming intergovernmental conference which will consider possible changes to the EU Treaty.</P>
      <P>This Government, as well as previous governments, takes the view that the issue of taxation is an area where the unanimity rule should be retained and there has been no change in that policy approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my budget speech that the Government is only too aware of the need to maintain confidence in the tax system &ndash; confidence which has been severely dented by recent revelations &ndash; and has already acted decisively in this regard. The 1999 Finance Act provided for a major extension of revenue powers, including easier access to records held in financial institutions and to general third party information. Revenue are actively using these new powers, which have retrospective effect, and I am confident that they will prove effective in pursuing both past and present tax evaders. If additional powers are found to be necessary, the Government will bring forward appropriate legislation in future Finance Bills.</P>
      <P>Serious tax evaders will be prosecuted where there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. To this end Revenue has set up a dedicated team, which includes a senior member of staff from the DPP's office, to pursue criminal prosecutions in suitable cases. On the question of disclosure where tax evasion has been discovered, the identity of those tax evaders who settle with Revenue will continue to be published under existing legal powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> As well as additional powers, I have also provided Revenue with additional resources. Earlier this year I sanctioned the appointment of 37 new staff, mainly to the audit and investigation side. These included four professional accountants, two solicitors and a banking expert. The Revenue Commissioners have reviewed their overall staffing requirements and I am now considering requests that they recently put to me in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards tax collection generally, Revenue are well on the way to eliminating some £1 billion of historical tax arrears by the end of this year. They have had increasing success in recovering unpaid taxes in liquidation and receivership cases, particularly cases involving so-called phoenix companies. New and more effective arrangements have recently been put in place with Revenue sheriffs and only last week six additional firms of solicitors were appointed to assist in collecting arrears of taxes.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that this Government is fully committed, as set out in the action programme review, to supporting Revenue in its efforts to pursue past and present evaders and defaulters, and that all necessary measures will be taken to achieve a significant improvement in tax compliance.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to my recent announcements regarding individualisation and the £3,000 allowance for one income families whose spouses work at home to care for children, the aged and the handicapped. As I stated in my budget speech, I intend to build on last year's radical income tax reform. Therefore budget 2000 introduced many measures which will assist earners, reduce the level of tax for all taxpayers, including the elderly, exclude more people on low incomes from the tax net and remove a large number of middle-income earners on the average industrial wage from the top rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, to increase the incentive to work both the standard and top rates of tax will be reduced by 2% each to 22% and 44%. Increases in the personal allowances of £500 single-£1,000 married will mean that no single taxpayer earning under £110 will pay tax. This measure will remove over 40,000 taxpayers from the tax net. The age exemption limits will be increased to £7, 500 single-£15,000 married, removing up to 10,000 elderly from the tax net. A £3,000 allowance, at the standard rate, will be introduced for one income families whose spouses work in the home to care <Col N="1422" /> for children, the aged and the handicapped. This measure will have the effect of removing a further 23,000 taxpayers from the tax net. Over 125,000 taxpayers will no longer be paying at the higher rate of tax, reducing by nearly one-fifth the percentage of taxpayers on the higher rate. Personal allowances for aged, blind, widows, dependant relatives and incapacitated children will be doubled and standard rated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the budget included significant social welfare and other expenditure measures as follows. Full rate personal payments for all old age and related pensions will increase by £7 per week. Other social welfare personal rates will increase by £4 per week. Qualified adult allowances will increase by a minimum of £3.80 a week. Child benefit will increase by £8 per month for the first and second child and by £10 per month for the third and subsequent children. There will be a new insurance-based carer's benefit for people who leave employment to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. Health spending increased by £4.2 billion in 2000 compared to £3 billion in 1998. There will be £35 million in a full year for mental handicap, an additional £17 million for education and a package to increase childcare places costing £46.4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The personal tax package and the expenditure measures which I have announced will make an important contribution to the promotion of social inclusion and will ensure that all our citizens share in our growing prosperity.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies which I gave to similar questions on this matter, namely, Question No. 21 on 10 November 1999 and Question No. 204 on 16 November 1999. The EU Commission has issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland, pursuant to article 226 of the EC Treaty, concerning directive 92/84/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages. The opinion argues that the present Irish alcohol tax regime is contrary to article 90 of the EU Treaty in that the Irish excise duty on wine is, in their view, discriminatory as a consequence of the lower excise imposed on beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have responded to the Commission pointing out that Irish excise rates on alcohol broadly reflect alcoholic strength of products; the excise duty ratio between beer-wine is approximately 1:3, reflecting the relative alcoholic strength of beer and wine actually sold in Ireland, beer and wine are not in the sort of direct competition which the Commission maintain and are not marketed, distributed or sold in the same way, and <Col N="1423" /> the EU Commission permits a zero rate of excise on wine in many member states which tax beer. This in itself is a distortion which the Commission has not acted on.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Commission to decide in the light of our response whether to pursue their case under legal procedures provided for in the treaty.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the £3,000 allowance for one income families whose spouses work at home to care for children, the aged and the handicapped which I announced on Wednesday 8 December. As I stated on that date, the Government has decided to bring forward a £3,000 per annum tax allowance at the standard rate of tax in respect of spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. This fulfils a promise made by the Government in the joint Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Party statement issued prior to the June 1997 general <Col N="1424" /> election of an allowance, set at £2,000 then for families in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>This undertaking was always on the list of measures to be pursued in the Government's two remaining budgets but has been implemented now to recognise the role of spouses who work in the home and to balance the tax relief measures announced in the budget on 1 December 1999 which addressed the position where both spouses were in paid employment.</P>
      <P>The specific details of the operation of the scheme will be set out in the Finance Bill to be published next February. This tax relief will be worth up to £660 per annum to one income married families on the standard and higher rate of tax at all income levels but will be of greater proportionate value to lower income families because it is standard-rated. The full year cost is estimated at £125 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Figures on employment and unemployment were compiled annually from the labour force survey up to April 1997; and, since the fourth quarter of 1997, corresponding quarterly figures have been available from the quarterly national household survey.</P>
      <P>The figures on employment and unemployment are compiled in accordance with the internationally-recognised ILO labour force definitions. Persons in employment are those who worked for one hour or more for payment or profit in the week before the survey, including work on the family farm or business, and all persons who had a job but were not at work because of illness, holidays etc. in the week. Unemployed persons are those who, in the week before the survey were without work, were available for work, and had taken specific steps in the preceding four weeks to find work. The labour force comprises persons employed plus unemployed. The unemployment rate is the number of persons unemployed expressed as a percentage of the labour force.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the numbers in employment, the number of unemployed, the labour force and the unemployment rate in April 1995, 1996 and 1997 and in each quarter since September-November 1997.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Credit Act 1995, which came into effect on 13 May 1996, allocated responsibility for issuing licences to moneylenders to the director of Consumer Affairs. The director has informed me that there are currently 66 licensed moneylenders operating in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants for a moneylender's licence must go through a formal application process. The Director of Consumer Affairs may refuse an applicant a licence on a number of grounds, including if, <Col N="1428" /> in the director's opinion, the cost of credit to be charged by the applicant is excessive or if any of the terms or conditions attaching thereto are unfair. I understand that, in a number of instances, her office has advised applicants that they would not be granted licences unless they reduced their proposed cost of credit. On each occasion, the moneylenders concerned reduced their proposed charges accordingly. The director has informed me that her office will continue to keep the total cost of credit charged by moneylenders under review.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs estimates that approximately £60 million is currently outstanding by way of loans granted by licensed moneylenders. Loans granted by the ten largest licensed moneylenders represent the majority of this figure.</P>

      <P>The administration, enforcement and promotion of occupational health and safety legislation is a day to day matter for the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>I understand from the authority that 3,078 construction sites were visited by it in the current year up to 5 December. A total of 327 prohibition notices were issued by inspectors of the authority prohibiting the carrying on of specific activities until the matters specified in the notice had been remedied. Such notices may apply to all or part of a site depending on the circumstances. Three sites were closed under orders of the High Court obtained under section 39 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. A further five sites were the subject of voluntary closures, that is, where no formal notice was issued by an inspector. In addition, 137 improvement notices were served on construction sites requiring specific measures to be taken. A substantial number of written and verbal warnings were also issued by inspectors in the course of carrying out their duties in relation to construction sites. If the Deputy requires any additional information, I advise that he get in touch directly with the authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2; telephone (01) 614 7000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper management of workplace health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, <Col N="1429" /> information and partnership. Inspection is but one element in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, commitment and participation from all sides is necessary to foster safe work practices on site.</P>
    <P>I have been urging a partnership approach and was pleased that recent discussions between the authority, ICTU and CIF culminated in the construction safety partnership agreement which I launched in October of this year. The partnership will consider all aspects of construction site safety and is to produce a construction industry safety plan within three months which will incorporate the recommendations of both the forum for the Construction Industry and the authority's Construction Advisory Committee and will include proposals related to consultation and safety representation. All relevant proposals, including those made by SIPTU in relation to full-time safety representatives, will be considered in the preparation of the plan which I look forward to receiving in due course.</P>
    <P>In addition to the construction safety partnership, a joint construction site safety representatives pilot programme was also announced. This pilot programme will benefit directly the participating projects and will also generate an awareness of health and safety among all employers and employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Employment Agencies Act 1971, a person shall not carry on the business of an employment agency except under and in accordance with a licence under that Act. On foot of applications received in 1997, in 1998 and in 1999 to end November for the grant of licences to operate the business of employment agency, the total number of <Col N="1430" /> licences issued in those years were, respectively, 277, 329 and 400. All licences issued under the Act have a validity period of one year at the end of which, subject to continued adherence by the licensees to the relevant governing conditions, they are renewed upon application. No applications were refused in any of the years 1997, 1998 or to date in 1999.</P>
    <P>The primary instrument by which employment agency activity is monitored-regulated is the licensing scheme itself. Licences are issued to applicants only when they have fulfilled, to the full satisfaction of my Department, the relevant governing conditions as laid down by the 1971 Act and by regulations made thereunder. These conditions are designed, in the main, to ensure that only persons who are of good character and who carry on employment agency business from premises which are suitable for that purpose are granted licences.</P>
    <P>In assessing applications my Department operates a policy of strict adherence to all of the licensing criteria. Monitoring activity also involves the checking of daily newspapers to ensure that employment agencies which advertise are licensed in accordance with the Act. While no formalised system for the tracking of statistics on complaints is in place, I point out that the effect of this monitoring by my Department, is, as the figures show, resulting in ever increasing numbers of employment agencies operating in compliance with the Act.</P>

      <P>The Casual Trading Act, the principal purpose of which is the regulation of casual trading by local authorities, has been in effect for less than five years and many local authorities outside Dublin are only in the process of implementing it in their own areas. Accordingly, I have no immediate plans to change the Act.</P>
      <P>If the development and modernisation of this sector requires promotion in accordance with the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum, in my view local authorities and local tourism interests are best placed to foster self-employment and enterprise in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Objective One or BMW region, has great advantages in terms of excellent people and also benefits from the same favourable tax regime as the rest of the State. However, as was acknowledged in the national development plan, the southern-eastern region &ndash; Objective One in transition &ndash; is considerably more developed economically than the BMW region. This is particularly the case in the areas of physical infrastructure such as transport and telecommunications. To this extent the transition region can be said to have a definite advantage for attracting mobile investment.</P>
      <P>However, the dramatic development of Galway city and its hinterland, together with increased investment in towns like Sligo, Ballina and Castlebar, show that locations in the Objective One region can attract mobile projects. It is my intention that they should be able to attract an even greater share in the planning period to 2006.</P>
      <P>Recognition is given to existing regional disparities in the new regional aid limits for assistance to enterprise recently agreed with the EU Commission, a copy of which follows for information. I am confident that the new limits will be of considerable assistance to the development agencies in promoting a greater regional balance in economic activity.</P>
      <P>A central feature of the NDP is investment aimed at removing infrastructural disadvantages, but public investment and location incentives are only one element in genuine, sustainable regional development. Government is but one important participant in a much more complex process and much will depend on the response of the individual regions and localities</P>

      <P>Under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, the functions of the Foyle Fisheries Commission have been transferred to the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission which is one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies. The relevant fisheries legislation now applies to the Carlingford area as it applied to the Foyle area under the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
      <P>Work is proceeding on fresh legislation for the commission to provide for the aquaculture development and licensing functions and for the exercise of a development function in relation to inland fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas. It is hoped that this legislation will be published early in the new year.</P>
      <P>At present there are strong links between the commission and the fisheries boards, in particular the Northern Regional Fisheries Board. It is expected that these links will continue to develop very positively given the enhanced functions and geographical scope of the commission as well as given the enhanced roles and remits of the fisheries boards envisaged in the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been consistent in its response to humanitarian emergencies in Africa over the past number of years and continues to commit substantial funds to humanitarian relief efforts <Col N="1434" /> through the UN and through Irish and international non-governmental organisations.</P>
      <P>We have kept our focus on Africa in funding matters, despite the media attention devoted to other emergencies around the world. This year the Oireachtas approved an additional £6 million for the victims of the Kosovo crisis so as to ensure that funding for humanitarian crises in Africa and other parts of the world would not be affected.</P>
      <P>Details of all emergency humanitarian funding provided by the Government for the years 1995 to 1998 are outlined in the Ireland Aid annual reports, available from the Dáil Library. In 1999, the Government has allocated a total of £3,230,525 for emergency humanitarian projects in ten countries in Africa. Details on the projects funded and the amounts allocated to each follow.</P>

      <P>Recognising the major challenges facing An Post, the Government recently accepted my proposals on the need for the company to engage in a radical transformation process. The Government has agreed that part of this transformation will involve a strategic alliance with one of the major European operators and agreement to early liberalisation of the postal market. The Government has also given the go-ahead for negotiations on an employee share ownership scheme which will be part of the transformation of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the company to consider all of these issues, in conjunction with the unions in An Post, and to put proposals to me at an early date. The details of an ESOP, including the question of an independent valuation of the company, will be considered by me, together with my colleague, <Col N="1436" /> the Minister for Finance, following receipt of proposals from the management and unions. An independent valuation of the company has not been conducted to date.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement identifies strategic transport planning as one of a number of areas for North-South co-operation. No meetings have yet been arranged with my counterpart, the Minister for Regional Development, in the Northern Ireland Executive. The future development of cross-Border public transport links would be among the matters I would wish to raise at any future meeting. However, the development of a high speed rail service from Dublin to Derry would be a day-to-day matter for Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways have recently completed the upgrading of the railway service between Dublin and Belfast. The new jointly operated enterprise service has resulted in more frequent and faster journey times between both cities. Scheduled weekday journey times are now under two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland Railways is responsible for the operation of all services between Belfast and Derry. The line has slower speeds than the Belfast-Dublin line and Northern Ireland Railways is currently upgrading the trackwork. It also plans to re-open the former Antrim to Bleach Green line which will give a more direct route <Col N="1438" /> and reduce journey time between Derry and Belfast. Connections are currently provided to some enterprise services and these will be improved when the Antrim-Bleach Green line is re-opened. I understand the railway companies currently have no plans to provide through services.</P>

      <P>There are no talks planned at present with my transport counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive specifically on the development of a Dublin to Derry air service. As I mentioned at the North-South Ministerial Council which I attended yesterday, 13 December 1999, I intend to meet soon all Ministers with whom I have an overlap of interest to review the possibilities for ongoing co-operation in the transport, energy and communications sectors. As the Deputy will be aware, I have already met my counterpart on energy matters.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that under the peace and reconciliation programme, a total of £1.528 million in aid was allocated to Derry airport in July 1999 from my Department's Vote towards the cost of a runway extension and assorted works. This is being matched by a similar grant from the Northern Ireland side.</P>
      <P>While the provision of air services on specific routes is now essentially a matter for the commercial judgment of airlines, it will continue to be my policy to encourage the development of as many air services as possible to and from all Irish airports, and I would welcome a service between Dublin and Derry.</P>

      <P>The application from the person named was received on 15 October 1999. Further information was needed and this was provided on 4 November. Accordingly, the date of valid application was 4 November 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applicant sought admission to the scheme under the joint management arrangement with her husband. It is a condition of the scheme that in a joint management application, a participant <Col N="1441" /> or a participant's spouse must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Evidence of the application and the reply from that Department must be submitted to my Department before payment of the farm retirement pension can be approved.</P>
    <P>This applicant's husband is over 66 years of age and my Department wrote to her on 2 December to inform her of this requirement. When the necessary reply from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is submitted, the application for the farm retirement pension can be processed and payment made backdated to 4 November 1999, the date of valid application.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons townlands (details supplied) in County Monaghan were not classified as more severely disadvantaged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The townlands listed below were considered by the disadvantaged areas appeals panel as part of its overall examination of areas for reclassification as more severely handicapped in County Monaghan. The criteria used to assess areas for more severely handicapped status were agreed between the disadvantaged areas appeals panel; the farming organisations and my Department, as follows. Income had to be less that 60% of national average income; land quality had to be four or lower on a scale of 0 to 9. The area had to be contiguous <Col N="1442" /> to the existing more severely handicapped boundary.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission made it clear in discussions with my Department that the contiguity criterion would not be satisfied by areas which barely touched the existing MSH boundary and-or extended away from the boundary in long &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; of land. In addition, areas which, if reclassified, would result in &ldquo;holes&rdquo;, i.e. non-reclassified land surrounded by more severely handicapped areas, would not be considered.</P>
      <P>The following townlands were all rejected because the income in each case exceeded the limit of 60% of national average income: Cormeen, Drumanny, Drumgarkin, Dyan and Freame Mount Demesne in the DED of Dawsongrove (R138); Cornasoo, Corvoam, Creevagh, Darraghlan, Drumalt, Dunraymond and Glenish in the DED of Caddagh (R145); Cornaglare, Drummuck and Tullygillen in the DED of Kilmore (R154); Aghnaskea, Cormoy, Drumacoon, Drumbaragh, Drumshannon, Genagh and Killyfuddy in the DED of Killeevin (R132); Clondinnery and Lisalea in the DED of Newbliss (R133); Aughnaclea, Annamacneill, Ballynagarry, Cordoolagh, Cornanure, Drumroosk, Lantaur, Legacurry, Lennan, Mullan and Tiromedan in the DED of Tullycorbett (R163).</P>
      <P>The remaining townlands were excluded for the following reasons: Cargaghramer, Coohey, Corfinlough, Cornacreeve and Drumlongfield in the DED of Tullycorbett satisfied the Income criterion but only Cornacreeve touches the MSH boundary and that only barely. Inclusion of these townlands would also create holes of LSH inside MSH areas.</P>
      <P>In DED Killeevan, Annagose, Drummullan, Effernagh and Tinary satisfy the income criterion, but only Tinary touches the MSH boundary, and the rest stretch away from the boundary in a long &ldquo;finger&rdquo;. In addition, their inclusion would cause a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; of LSH inside a MSH area.</P>
      <P>The townlands of Drumguff, Lisdarragh and Teer in DED Newbliss, and the townlands of Glinch and Guardhill in DED Killeevan satisfy the income criterion. However, their inclusion would cause a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; of LSH inside a MSH area. Cavanagarvan and Lisnashannagh in the DED of Kilmore satisfy the income condition, but they stretch away from the MSH boundary.</P>
      <P>In the DED of Caddagh, the townlands of Caddagh, Cordevlis South, Dromore, Drumgavny, Drumgreeny, Edenferkin, Garranroe, Lisnaveane, Losset, Tetoppa and Tirardan satisfy the income criterion. Edenferkin touches the MSH boundary but all the other townlands stretch away from Edenferkin in a long &ldquo;finger&rdquo;, and are separated from the MSH boundary by another finger of townlands which do not satisfy the income criterion.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 38 beef cows under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme. At an inspection carried out on 10 August 1999 one of the animals applied on, tag number PRA644663, was absent and the person named was informed by letter of 26 October 1999 that no grant was payable on this animal and that the grants payable on the remaining animals would be subject to a reduced payment in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the schemes. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case but no reply was received from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms and conditions governing the headage schemes, the combined headage grant payable to an applicant under these schemes cannot exceed £4,000. Payment of £2,000 issued to him under the 1999 cattle headage scheme on 8 <Col N="1444" /> December 1999 which, combined with the £2,000 paid to him under the 1999 sheep headage scheme on 27 September 1999 is the maximum payable to the person named.</P>
    <P>As the person named did not reply to my Department's letter of 26 October 1999 requesting a review of the penalty decision, his application under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme was processed for payment and accordingly he was paid the 60% advance of £2,875.90 under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme on 2 December 1999. His entitlement under this scheme was subject to the 2.7% penalty. If the person named wishes to provide any new evidence in respect of the animal which was absent at the date of inspection he should write to my Department and the matter will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for a total of 19.09 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area of 15.97 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 3.12 hectares or 19.53% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case a penalty of 6.24 hectares has to be applied leaving the area determined for payment at 9.73 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium on 30 suckler cows under the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme on 30 May 1995, on 38 cows under the 1997 scheme on 28 May 1997 and on 47 cows under the 1998 scheme on 28 May 1998.</P>
      <P>Under the 1995 scheme the person named was paid an advance of £1640.40 on 19 January 1996 in respect of 20 cows and a balance of £1,093.60 on 24 January 1996. In addition the applicant was paid his full entitlement of £1,367 on the other ten cows on 8 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the 1997 scheme it was established following an on-farm inspection on 4 November 1997 that ten of the animals on the claim were not properly tagged, which meant that the animals in question were not eligible for premium. Payment of £3926.44 in respect of the other 28 animals on the claim issued on 10 November 1998.</P>
      <P>Under the 1998 scheme following an on-farm inspection on 23 July 1998 it was established that 11 animals on the claim had identification errors which resulted in them being deleted without penalty from the claim. It was therefore established that the applicant had an entitlement to payment on 36 animals. The applicant was subsequently paid £3,3814.25 on 27 October 1998, a further payment of £112.99 on 18 November 1998 and a final balance of £1,121.84 on 20 April 1999.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since the FOI Act commenced for central Government Departments and related public bodies on 21 April 1998, its scope was extended to health boards and local authorities on 21 October 1998, and on 21 October last to voluntary hospitals and certain publicly funded voluntary bodies providing services to people with intellectual disability. The Government in July last decided to extend the scope of the Act further over the next 12 to 24 months to a range of bodies in the areas of health, education, industrial enterprise, environment, social services and broadcasting.</P>
      <P>This approach is in keeping with the Government's intention to extend the scope of the Act across the wider public service in an incremental fashion as experience is gained in its application. Any decision to extend its terms to Coillte or any other public service body will be taken in this context.</P>
      <P>With particular regard to Údarás na Gaeltachta, I refer the Deputy to the reply to his question of 2 November given by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, where the Minister of State indicated that he, in conjunction with me, will be examining the question of the future application of the FOI Act to an tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>The completion of the arrangements on 2 December to bring into being the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and other institutions under the Good Friday Agreement has been a source of great joy to all who have supported the Agreement. Not only has it lifted all our spirits, generating a great sense of optimism all over the island, but it is inspiring a particular confidence in the Border regions. This will especially be the case following the announcement yesterday by the North-South Ministerial Council that a number of offices connected with the new institutions, including the implementation bodies, will be located in the border areas. These will include Southern offices in Monaghan, Carrick-on-Shannon, one near Carlingford, and one in East Donegal. This will be a significant stimulus to the local communities concerned, through the benefits which such investment will generate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point to the new peace in the region which is itself having a profound effect. The level of North-South co-operation is continuing to increase in the new climate and will be signifi<Col N="1463" /> cantly underpinned by the new institutions and bodies.</P>
    <P>We are also seeing the benefits of the enhanced co-operation which has flowed from the continuing investment in the Border regions under the EU INTERREG and peace programmes. It is clear this Government, through the various vehicles for developing the Border regions, is doing an enormous amount of work to develop the local economies.</P>

      <P>I looked at this issue in the context of the 1999 Finance Bill and again in the context of the current budget, but decided not to take action. There is no evidence of lack of interest in taxi licences in Dublin where wheelchair accessibility has been a requirement for new licence holders and applications greatly exceed the number available. In addition, there is a substantive problem in that any VRT concession for taxis and hackneys would itself be costly and could lead to further revenue losses with private cars, as vehicles could be passed through the taxi/hackney fleet to avail of any tax concession. VRT is paid on initial registration and does not require the retention of a vehicle for any time period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the collection and compliance procedures used in connection with the company are fully justified by reference to the possible risk to tax compliance. The company was incorporated on 1 July 1999. It is regarded as high risk from a tax viewpoint having regard to the tax history associated with the previous business entity.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, revenue is monitoring the tax compliance of the company closely to ensure that its tax affairs are kept up to date. When no returns or tax payments were made by the company, action had to be initiated. This included the entering of estimates under section 22 of the VAT Act, 1972, and section 989 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and the use of the power of attachment under section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, when tax, which was properly due and payable, remained unpaid after the issue of normal demands. The company has now submitted all outstanding returns and the bulk of the outstanding payments and the notice of attachment is no longer in place.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that its approach to this company's tax affairs is fair and equitable and fully consistent with the objective of ensuring that tax obligations are fully complied with in a timely fashion, and that the approach is in line with published information on how cases of this kind would be handled.</P>

      <P>The Mid-West Regional Authority made a submission to me in June 1998 on its investment priorities for the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, in response to an invitation from me to all regional authorities. Clare County Council was among the many contributors to the Mid-West Regional Authority's submission. The submission contained an analysis of the mid west region's development needs, objectives and a strategy for development of the region, including various projects which they wished to see funded under the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan is a seven year, £40.6 billion strategic investment plan for sustainable national and regional economic and social development. One of the key objectives of the plan is the promotion of balanced regional development and, to this end, the plan contains <Col N="1465" /> specific investments and an integrated strategy for the development of the border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. The plan does not provide for investments on a county basis nor would it be appropriate for it to do so.</P>
    <P>The plan will be implemented through three inter-regional operational programmes, and two regional operational programmes. Details of the measures and projects to be funded will emerge in the course of the development and implementation of the operational programmes.</P>

      <P>It is my intention that this process will proceed on an inclusive basis. For the merger to proceed, the trustees, the boards of NewBank and ACC and the Partnership Committee will need to be in agreement in relation to all the major elements of the process relevant to them.</P>

      <P>In my first budget I reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. There is also an annual <i>de minimis</i> of £1,000 to exempt small gains from the <Col N="1467" /> tax. While I sympathise with the cases mentioned by the Deputy, I have no proposals to amend the capital gains tax code in this regard. There are already income tax reliefs in the system to assist persons meeting medical and nursing bills.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly where rollover relief from capital gains tax is not available where shares must be sold in the context of a takeover; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Rollover relief under the capital gains tax code provides for a deferral of tax if the proceeds from the disposal of certain trading assets are reinvested in new trading assets within three years of the disposal. The tax position on the gain from the old asset is looked at when the new asset acquired is disposed of and there is not a subsequent reinvestment.</P>
      <P>In general, rollover relief is not available on the sale of shares. However, a type of rollover relief may be available if shares in a company are disposed of by an employee or director of a company and the proceeds are reinvested within three years in new shares in a company in which the person concerned becomes an employee or director and holds at least 15% of the ordinary share capital of the company within three years of the original disposal. This relief is to encourage entrepreneurs to reinvest in start-up companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further type of rollover relief may also be available where a company finances a takeover by issuing its own shares to a person in exchange for the shares of the company the subject of the takeover. Rollover relief is provided by treating the new shares as if they were the old shares for capital gains tax purposes, i.e. the disposal of the old shares and the acquisition of the new shares are ignored for capital gains tax purposes. Any gain or loss on the disposal of the old shares is <Col N="1468" /> effectively deferred until the new shares are disposed of. A similar relief is available in the case of company mergers. This relief recognises that a person involved in a share for share exchange receives no cash.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to introduce further reliefs to apply in respect of the proceeds of shares sold in the context of a takeover, given that the rate of capital gains tax is only 20%.</P>

    <P>The numbers of claimants in respect of 1997/98 and 1998/99 are projected estimates.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>As I said in my Budget Speech of 1 December 1999, the Bacon report on housing last March recommended that the rent relief for under 55's be increased to take account of the recent trends in rents across the country. Accordingly, the rent relief allowance for those under 55 will be increased by 50% from 6 April next from £500 single £750 widowed and £1,000 married, to £750 single, £1,125 widowed and £1,500 married <i>per annum.</i> The cost of this increase is estimated at £7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>In addition, I propose to standard-rate the rent relief for those aged 55 and over, which is currently available at the tax payers marginal rate, while ensuring, at the same time, that no person claiming the relief at the higher rate of income tax will lose out. Consequently, the rental relief for those aged 55 and over will be double from 6 <Col N="1469" /> April next to £2,000 single, £3,000 widowed and £4,000 married <i>per annum</i> and will be applied at the standard rate of income tax. Since 80% of those on the relief are standard rate taxpayers, this amounts, in effect, to a doubling of the relief for four out of five claimants. The cost of this measure is just under £1 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 200 together as they refer to the same case.</P>
      <P>In regard to outstanding correspondence, I accept that there was a delay in replying to this case, which was due to pressure of other work in the relevant areas in question. This is regretted but the information requested has now been supplied to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the procedures for public sector contracts, the position is that for all such contracts of a value of £5,000, inclusive of VAT, or more within any 12 month period, the contractor is required to produce either a valid tax clearance or C2 certificate.</P>
      <P>Section 1095 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides that the Collector-General must issue a tax clearance certificate to a person who has complied with the obligation to pay and remit any taxes, interest and penalties and to deliver returns due to Revenue. An applicant for a tax clearance certificate has a statutory right to appeal a refusal of a certificate to the Appeal Commissioners and the courts. This right is conditional on the payment of outstanding liabilities, provided such liabilities are not in dispute.</P>
      <P>Due process must be observed in making decisions to grant or refuse a certificate. It would not be appropriate for the Collector-General to use the tax clearance legislation to refuse certificates in circumstances where legal disputes concerning the liability exist or Revenue investigations have not been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where additional tax liability is found to exist after the issue of a certificate and in respect of periods before or after the issue of the certificate, the issue of the certificate will not prevent the pursuit, through enforcement if necessary, of such liability by Revenue. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in practice, such liabilities are, and will continue to be, pursued to collection, as will all interest and penalties attaching <Col N="1470" /> thereto. In addition, the renewal of a certificate would be refused if liabilities not in dispute remain unpaid at the time of the renewal request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The national year 2000 emergencies co-ordination committee was established by the Government to oversee and co-ordinate the year 2000 contingency preparations and emergency management arrangements of the key national utility, infrastructure, health, security, financial and business sectors, so as to mitigate potential disruptions to society in the event of problems arising from year 2000 related incidents and/or millennium celebrations. The committee is representative of the business and financial sectors and Departments that provide the vital services necessary to our society and our economy.</P>
      <P>The committee has met three times, on 22 September, 28 October and 18 November, and will meet again this Thursday, 16 December. The committee will remain in place until all possible year 2000 related disruptions have been avoided or have been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee has reviewed the general state of readiness, and the information co-ordination and emergency management arrangements among the sectors, in the light of the interdependencies between them. To facilitate and develop the review procedure, the committee established an emergency services sub-group and a financial services sub-group to further the work of identifying interdependencies between sectors and ensuring that effective information and management co-ordination procedures were in place. <Col N="1471" /> Based on the work of the sub-groups, the committee is satisfied with the state of readiness of the sectors and that effective co-ordination arrangements are in place between the key sectors which will enable a speedy response in the event of a problem arising.</P>
    <P>As regards public information on the year 2000 issue, it should be emphasised that the &ldquo;millennium bug&rdquo; could potentially impact on business rather than on households or household appliances. Accordingly, a comprehensive business awareness campaign is being carried out to raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance under the aegis of the Department of enterprise, Trade and Employment. The campaign includes a guide which issued to 150,000 business nationwide, seminars, a national Y2K information service for business free of charge, and TV and radio advertising campaigns.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of information to the public, each of the key sectors involved in the provision of services to the public, and which are represented at the national year 2000 emergencies co-ordination committee, are providing information to their customers, e.g., the banking sector has conducted a campaign on money and the millennium; the key public utilities, road, rail and air services; gas, electricity, postal, telecommunications and broadcasting services are also engaged in publicity campaigns. In addition, under the auspices of the national co-ordination committee these service providers, including health boards, the local authorities, public utilities and banks etc. are placing advertisements in the local press detailing their holiday arrangements and, in some cases, contact telephone numbers, where necessary. The key point that I would like to emphasise is that preparations and arrangements are being made to ensure that we have business as usual during the millennium changeover period and that, in the event that any issues arise over the millennium changeover period, they will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the Deputy wishes to be supplied with information on the position in relation to private bus operators providing school bus runs under contract to Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>The repayment provision is contained in paragraph 12(11) of the Imposition of Duties (No 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (SI No 307/75).</P>
      <P>The conditions governing repayment are that: the applicant carries on a passenger road service within the meaning of section 2, Road Transport Act, 1932, and is either the licensee under a passenger licence granted under section 11 of the Act in respect of the passenger road service, or is exempted by the application of section 7 of the Act; the claim is made within four months from the date the oil is used or within such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may in a particular case allow.</P>
      <P>Prior to March 1998 a small number of private bus operators had claimed repayments under the scheme but these were refused by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of advice from the Department of Public Enterprise that the services provided to CIE were in the nature of private hire and, therefore, would not be regarded as coming within the definition of road passenger services for the purposes of the Road Transport Act, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1998 the Department of Public Enterprise advised Revenue that, in the circumstances of the contractual arrangement between CIE (Bus Éireann) and the private operators, the private operators were considered to be provid<Col N="1473" /> ing a service under contract to Bus Éireann and were considered to be covered by the exemption granted to CIE under the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>Revenue informed the private operators that, with effect from March 1998, they would be eligible for repayment under the 1975 order. A strict interpretation of the four months time limit in the order for lodgement of claims would have limited retrospective claims to December 1997. However, as a third party had already been authorised to lodge claims for school bus runs on an annual basis, the Commissioners, in the interests of equity, extended the time limit to allow for lodgement of claims by the private operators also on an annual basis. Accordingly valid claims for oil usage since 1 January 1997 are currently being accepted.</P>
    <P>While there are not plans to extend retrospection further, recent legal advice, which the Revenue Commissioners have received, has raised complex policy and legal issues regarding repayments under the scheme. These matters are under consideration by the Revenue Commissioners and by the relevant Departments concerned. As soon as the issues have been resolved, the outcome will be communicated to the various interests concerned.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has considerable tax arrears in respect of the 1989-90 to 1994-95 tax years. The assessments for those years are based on the taxpayer's returns of income and there is, therefore, no question of reviewing the assessments.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer's agent has contacted the inspector about the taxpayer's arrears. The inspector has indicated that it is open to the taxpayer to enter into an arrangement to pay the outstanding liability over a period of years. The inspector is awaiting the taxpayer's proposals in that regard.</P>

Dublin Corporation provides an emergency ambulance service on behalf of the Eastern Health Board from 11 locations throughout Dublin city. The identification of priorities for the development of the ambulance service in Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance and it is my Department's policy to respond to these priorities within the framework of overall policy on the development <Col N="1475" /> of pre-hospital and ambulance services as set out in the report of the review group on the ambulance service and cardiovascular health strategy. Recent improvements to the ambulance service in the greater Dublin area include the expansion of ambulance resources in Swords, Maynooth and Tallaght as well as the commissioning of a joint fire and ambulance control centre.</P>
      <P>On the funding front, the funding that I am providing in 2000 for the ambulance service brings to more than £33 million the total resources provided since the report of the review group was published with well over half of that £33 million investment has taken place during my term of office.

      <P>The issue of evictions or notices to quit private rented accommodation is outside my remit as Minister for Health and Children. The full range of health services, including services under the child care programme in relation to family conflict and domestic violence, are available to homeless people within the normal eligibility parameters. In relation to additional expenditure specifically targeted at homeless people, the position is as follows: £1 million is being allocated to the health boards in 2000 to support specific initiatives for homeless people. This includes £700,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the board to begin implementation of plans which it has drawn up for services for homeless people in the Dublin area; £1 million has been made available to the health boards in each of the years 1999 and 2000 to fund services, including refuge accommodation for women victims of violence; in 1998, I provided an amount of £50,000 to the AIDS fund housing project towards the cost of providing 15 apartments. This project provides accommodation for homeless people with AIDS. The Eastern Health Board will continue to support this project but it will also work through its outreach workers and in conjunction with other agencies to reduce the problem of homelessness among people with alcohol and drug misuse problems. The national drugs strategy team has asked local drug task forces to look at the issue of homelessness in order to develop a co-ordinated inter-task force response to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been experiencing difficulties in the provision of services in its regional orthodontic department in St. James's hospital over the past few months. I understand from the board that these difficulties were caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic opinions and the commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant's orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures.</P>
      <P>Despite negotiations and discussions at the highest level the consultant orthodontist persistently refused to provide services as outlined above. I understand that the consultant orthodontist's actions led to her suspension from duty without pay with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
      <P>Since her suspension, there has been on-going communication between health board senior management and the consultant orthodontist's representatives to see if the difficulties encountered could be overcome to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. In the interim, the board is making every effort to procure consultant cover to facilitate the full restoration of orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>As the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in Dublin is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to investigate the position in relation to the individual case referred to and to reply to the Deputy directly as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drug refund scheme, DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user-friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is, therefore, in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours, and pizza bases.

      <P>The Department of Health and Children and health boards are fully aware of the observations and recommendations of the World Health Organisation regarding fluorides and oral health.</P>
      <P>Estimation of total fluoride exposure is a feature of all fluoridation programmes. Prior to the introduction of water fluoridation in Ireland an investigation into the composition of Irish drinking waters with special reference to the distribution and significance of fluoride sponsored by the Medical Research Council was carried out by Drum. His studies of 42 water sources showed that only ten contained fluoride. Concentrations in these ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 parts per million fluoride. Prior to the introduction of water fluoridation to an area there is a statutory requirement to determine the level of fluoride in the existing water supply.</P>
      <P>In an Irish context other sources of exposure with public health significance arise from the use of fluoride toothpaste and fluoride mouthrinsing. With the introduction of water fluoridation in an area the principal dental surgeon ceases fluoride mouthrinsing. This leaves a community with one systemic and one topical source of exposure, the ideal level of exposure recommended by the World Health Organisation. I have requested the North Western Health Board to write to the Deputy with the results of all tests and surveys carried out relating to the water fluoridation programme in north County Sligo.</P>

      <P>The influence of fluoride on teeth has been known for almost 100 years.(1) In the United States in 1942, Dean demonstrated that in places where drinking water supplies had a natural fluoride content of one part per million (1pm), the prevalence of dental decay was significantly below average, yet the teeth did not have the mottled enamel, dental fluorosis, which was noticeable only when the level of fluoride was in excess of 2pm. (2) Research evidence suggests that periodic spikes of high fluoride in plasma <Col N="1481" /> such as that produced by inadvertent ingestion of fluoride toothpaste are more likely to produce fluorosis than a constant intake from day to day as with water fluoridation. Dental fluorosis associated with water fluoridation at 1pm is of the mildest variety and appears as barely discernible fine lacy markings on the teeth, detectable only by an experienced examiner.</P>

      <P>The fluoride ion absorbed from the diet interacts with all calcified tissues as part of a normal physiological process even where there is no water fluoridation. At a cellular level ameloblasts, odontoblasts, cementoblasts and osteoblasts interact with fluoride. The effect of fluoride on enamel formation consists of the partial substitution of hydroxyapatite with fluorapatite, the effect on bone is similar. The negatively charged hydroxyl ion being replaced with the negatively charged fluoride ion. This results in a more stable apatite crystal structure in bone with the loss of impurities such as carbonate and magnesium ions. While enamel once formed does not regenerate throughout life bone undergoes constant remodelling as part of a normal physiological process.</P>

      <P>As I outlined to the House on 20 October and 9 November 1999 the ratification of the Hague Convention will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. Accordingly a child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken to the preparation of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to future policy regarding recognition of non-convention adoptions after the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention has been introduced. This issue is not covered by the actual provisions of the Hague Convention. As the Deputy has indicated it is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention. However, the matter is still under examination and final decisions in regard to this matter have not yet been taken.</P>

      <P>Under the existing legislation adoption assessments may be carried out by health boards and adoption societies registered with the Adoption Board. Any society may apply to the Adoption Board for registration under the Adoption Act, 1952, sections 34 to 39, as amended, which prescribe the criteria to be met for registration. One such society, PACT, is currently carrying out assessments for inter-country adoption.</P>
      <P>The accreditation of competent bodies for example, adoption agencies and societies to undertake certain tasks such as assessment for inter-country adoption will be considered in the context of the proposed legislation to ratify the Hague Convention. I should point out that in view of the recent increases in staff assigned to inter-country adoption assessment, as well as the introduction of a standardised framework for assessment there should be a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed during the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to the House on 23 November 1999 in relation to the waiting times for assessment for inter-country adoption at the end of 1998. I have previously informed the House of the additional £213,000 which was allocated to the Eastern Health Board in 1999 following the publication of the report &lsquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures'. A further £500,000 has been allocated to the health boards in the year 2000 on the basis of waiting lists at end September, 1999, £236,000 of which has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board. The total additional funding for the Eastern Health Board amounts to £449,000 which represents an increase of 93% in funding over a short period.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to the House on 4 November 1999 in relation to recruitment of social workers and the initiatives which the Eastern Health Board has taken to improve the service to applicants for inter-country adoption.</P>
      <P>In addition the working group which has been established has begun the work of prioritising and planning implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Along with the additional funding allocated to the inter-country adoption service, training in the standardised framework model for assessment has begun. A three day seminar for all social workers in inter-country adoption was held at the end of November. Interim guidance documents were circulated and a detailed training manual will be commissioned early in the new year. The board has advised that the standardised framework approach to assessment will commence in January 2000 through the provision of preparation courses in the first instance with a view to commencing the standardised home study in April 2000 approximately.</P>
      <P>Arising from the increase in staff assigned to assessment, the initiatives which the board has taken and the introduction of the standardised framework mode, it is hoped that there will be a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed in the board in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, to school going children with an intellectual disability in the Kilkenny area is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. I understand from the board that the speech and language therapist who was providing services to the school in question has left the service. As a result, the provision of speech and language therapy services to the school in question has had to be curtailed as the board has had difficulty with the recruitment of a replacement speech and language therapist.</P>
      <P>As part of a strategy to address this problem, the board is currently sponsoring speech and language therapy students who are due to take up positions in July 2000. This will enable the board to reinstate the service to the school in question. The position is being reviewed by the board on an ongoing basis and priority will be given to children on the waiting list.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): A brief for the design team on the development of an acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital was agreed between the Eastern Health Board, Beaumont Hospital and my Department in 1998. However, early in 1999, the Eastern Health Board put forward a proposal for a day hospital for the psychiatry of old age, to be situated on the Beaumont Hospital site and developed as an integral part of the department of psychiatry. This proposal had the support of the management of Beaumont Hospital and of a consultant psychiatrist in the hospital. The delay in appointing a design team for the project has been due to the necessity for an examination by my Department of the day hospital proposal. I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that I remain committed to the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital and I hope to make progress on the project as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>The indicative drugs target savings, IDTS, scheme was introduced in 1993 to encourage more rational and cost effective prescribing by general practitioners in the interests of both improved patient care and more efficient and effective use of health care resources. Similar schemes have been introduced across Europe and the IDTS scheme can justifiably be viewed, on the evidence available, as having been successful in its objectives.</P>
      <P>It is most important to bear in mind that the scheme is entirely voluntary and savings made thereunder are available to the general practitioners concerned for investment in general practice infrastructure and service development. Patients therefore benefit directly from the scheme in a very tangible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received no formal submission from IPHA of the type referred to in the question and I would point to the detailed examination of the scheme carried out by a review group, under the <Col N="1490" /> chairmanship of Professor Michael Murphy, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, University College, Cork. The review group was asked to provide an independent and wide-ranging evaluation of the effect of the IDTS on the quality of patient care with particular reference to changing patterns of prescribing. It reported in July 1997 and its principal findings were that while there were changes in prescribing behaviour as a result of the IDTS, resulting in reduced drug costs, there were no discernible negative effects in overall quality of prescribing. Accordingly, I have no plans to end the IDTS scheme, nor do I have any plans to introduce a system of annual health screening for all adults over the age of 30.</P>

      <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is considering the question of the future staffing of hospitals and will issue an interim report by the end of January. It is anticipated that the parties to the forum will be able to agree on a series of principles which will shape the future of our hospital services.</P>
      <P>The parties represented on the forum are agreed on the need to change the way our hospitals are organised and staffed so as to provide patients with access to suitably qualified and experienced medical personnel as required. Against that background there is an identifiable need for more consultants to be appointed. However there is also a clear need to have consultants available on a more flexible basis to cover periods of duty presently covered by NCHDs. All parties recognise that this will require changes in certain aspects of existing contracts.</P>

      <P>There is a clear distinction between the respective powers of the Medical Council and chief executives of health agencies. The council, as the autonomous statutory body which regulates the profession, has, as its primary obligation, the protection of the public from unqualified or incompetent doctors. The chief executives of health agencies can only be responsible for the activities of their own employees. Doctors who are employed in the public health service may be disciplined by their employers for a much wider range of behaviour than that covered by the Medical Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on <Col N="1494" /> health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>With effect from July 1999, revised arrangements for refunds for drugs were introduced. Under the new scheme, the drug payment scheme, a person and his-her dependants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

These homes are currently in receipt of funding from the board under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, and the rate of funding depends on the current level of activity at the individual home. The board advises me that there was an increase in allocations to these homes in 1999 and there will be a review of the level of funding provided in January 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to take part in yesterday's inaugural meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh where I met, along with the other Ministers, my counterpart, Minister Bairbre de Brún. At the meeting, a number of proposals for further co-operation in the health sector which had been identified as priority areas to be taken forward were agreed to be pursued within the context of the council meeting in health sector format early in the new year.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, already a long tradition of North-South interaction between Ministers for Health and between the Department of Health and Children in Dublin and the Department of Health and Social Services in Belfast. Since the early 1980s, my predecessors and I and the British Ministers then responsible for health matters have met on a regular, informal basis, alternately in Belfast and Dublin, to exchange information on policy issues, review progress in areas in which co-operation arrangements exist between their two Departments and share information on a number of other issues of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that informal co-operative arrangements have long been in operation on a day-to-day basis between the health authorities, North and South, along the Border area. A major focus for cross-Border interaction at local level is the co-operation and working together initiative, CAWT, which will assume even greater importance under the new administrative arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to meeting Minister de Brún again in the health council sectoral format early in the new year and to exploring the potential for joint co-operation in the four health areas that have already been identified for early examination. These are accident and emergency planning, high technology equipment, cancer research and health promotion. I believe that it will be possible under the new arrangements to further intensify the levels of co-operation and goodwill <Col N="1496" /> that already exist and also to identify further areas of co-operation which can be pursued to the mutual benefit of both North and South.</P>

      <Quest>the reason certain drugs are not available to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny who qualifies for the drugs cost subsidy scheme; and the other scheme, if any, available so that he qualifies for all drugs.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drug refund scheme. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over previous schemes and the <Col N="1497" /> scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>In addition, people who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. In this regard, income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines has been introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the new drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The comprehensive range of the most modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which was available on the GMS continues to be paid for under the new scheme. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available. Additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>In general, over the counter products, are not available under the schemes. However, if a medical card holder is suffering undue hardship obtaining a medicine which is not covered under the common list, he or she may apply to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for assistance in such instances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a further £23.5 million to agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2000. This represents an increase of 17.5% over the £20 million allocated in 1999, and is almost three times the amount allocated by the previous Government in 1997. Agencies may include appropriate investment in aspects of out-patient facilities where they conclude that the funding would help to address some of the underlying causes of waiting lists developing. The agencies are being asked to consider all appropriate options for maximising the use of waiting list funding, with an emphasis on innovative methods for reducing waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding levels of non-attendance in each out-patient clinic in public hospitals is not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that hospitals streamline their appointment arrangements for out-patient clinics, so that the reasons for any non-attendance do not arise from hospitals' appointments policies or other factors over which they have immediate control. However, I have also appealed to patients to use hospital facilities responsibly. In a keynote speech regarding acute hospital services on 16 November, I pointed out that patients must consider whether their use of facilities is appropriate and takes account of the needs of other patients. A failure by patients to inform hospitals of their decision not to attend for an out patient appointment, or of their inability to attend, would be of importance in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Best Health for Children report represents the outcome of an initiative by chief executive officers of health boards to have child health services for pre-school and primary school children reviewed. The report recognises that many parts of the new model are already in place, or could be put in place with a minimum of effort. The report also recognises that some aspects of the new model present significant challenges in both commitment and in implementation. Following on from the finalisation of the report, the chief executive officers established a national conjoint child health committee for the purpose of overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the report, and to ensure that the <Col N="1500" /> child health services are delivered in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the issue of determining the manner in which the implementation of the report can be best advanced is a matter for the national child health committee in the first instance. Where additional resources are required they will be identified by the conjoint committee and notified to my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a new study carried out in Dublin by a doctor (details supplied) on illegal drug users where he found that mortality among drug users due to overdose is 40%; and the steps, if any, he will take to deal with this problem.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the study referred to by the Deputy was a small study of 24 drug users carried out in one general practice. The preliminary findings of the study were presented at the Irish College of General Practitioners' scientific meeting held in November. Of the 24 patients, 23 had witnessed an overdose and ten had been the victim of overdose themselves. Twenty-two of the 24 drug users knew a victim of a fatal overdose and four of the 24 had been present at some stage in their lives at a fatal overdose.</P>
      <P>The study was reported in a medical newspaper recently under the heading &ldquo;Study reveals mortality among heroin users due to overdose is 40 per cent&rdquo;. However, this statement is not accurate as the ten drug users identified in the study as being a victim of overdose were not victims of a fatal overdose.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that overdoses among people addicted to opiates do occur. The nature of drug misuse often leads to drug misusers abusing more than one drug at any one time and this can, unfortunately, result in fatal consequences.</P>
      <P>Currently the cause of death among drug misusers is being examined by the Eastern Health Board through the examination of coroners' records and by linking mortality of drug misusers with cause of death over a four year period.</P>
      <P>While these studies are being carried out, the Eastern Health Board drug services and Dublin casualty departments are looking at methods of providing more rapid information in relation to drug overdoses.</P>

      <P>Drug misuse in Ireland takes two forms, opiate abuse, which is confined mainly to the greater Dublin area, and the misuse of other drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, amphetamines, tranquillisers, LSD inhalants-solvents and magic mushrooms, which is a nationwide phenomenon. Because of the illicit nature of drug misuse it is difficult to get a clear estimate of the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to opiate misuse various estimates have been made of the number of misusers in the greater Dublin area. These range from 8,500 to 13,500.</P>
      <P>There is no hard data on the use of other drugs. School surveys indicate that there has been an increase in the consumption of drugs, in particular cannabis. A European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs indicated that 37% of the 2,000 16 year olds surveyed in Ireland had, at some stage, tried cannabis. While on a par with the UK, this figure was high by comparison with other EU member states. This figure should be qualified, however, by noting that of this group of young people, only 10% had used cannabis 20 times or more. The prevalence of the use of cannabis among the group in the last 12 months was 33% and the 30 days prevalence was 19%. With regard to drugs other than cannabis, these included amphetamines, LSD or other hallucinogens, crack, cocaine, ecstasy and heroin, the ESPAD report found that 16% of those surveyed in Ireland had ever used one or more of these drugs. This figure is lower than the UK but is still high by comparison with other EU member states. However, most students who have used any illicit drug other than cannabis have done this only a few times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my term of office as Minister for Health and Children, I have undertaken a number of sub<Col N="1503" /> stantial initiatives in the acute hospital sector with a view to ensuring that services are reformed, re-organised and properly geared to meet the needs of our population. They include the recently launched cardiovascular health strategy which is aimed at achieving an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease; the investment of £4.9 million in 1998 and £5.5 million this year in cardiac services, including cardiac surgery, to support the objectives of the wider cardiovascular strategy; the continuing implementation of the national cancer strategy which is already improving the availability of cancer treatment services throughout the country; the preparation, currently in hand, of a plan for the development of renal services, which will involve an investment of £20 million over the next three years, £6 million of which will be spent in 2000; the establishment of a medical manpower forum to review key aspects of medical staffing in public hospitals; the opening of a major new hospital in Tallaght; a range of other initiatives in such areas as acute hospital governance and management development, clinicians in management, hospital accreditation, laboratory accreditation and health technology assessment; and the continuing implementation of a co-ordinated waiting list initiative.</P>
      <P>In terms of the future direction, I have recently comprehensively outlined my vision for achieving further progress in the development of acute hospital services. Against a background of the unprecedented increases that I have secured in day to day spending on health, the £4 billion barrier will be breached for the first time in 2000 having exceeded the £3 billion mark for the first time as recently as 1998, I recently announced the provision of £1 billion for infrastructural improvements in the acute hospital sector under the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developments that will be taking place will be underpinned by a number of key principles, as follows: equitable access to care, which does not place public patients at a disadvantage; availability of prompt treatment within a reasonable period &ndash; this means achieving very considerable reductions in the waiting time for public patients in all specialties, where measuring performance based on average waiting times is far more relevant than measuring the numbers on waiting lists; provision of the most appropriate form of care in the correct setting; a service that is organised and delivered in a patient-centred and very flexible manner, i.e. a longer core working day; flexible shift patterns, optimum use of expensive plant and equipment, implementation of pre-admission protocols for all elective cases, and much better synchronisation of the contributions of various professionals; comprehensive integration of services across all traditional boundaries, between and within hospital and community-based services, so that patients receive a seamless continuum of care &ndash; this requires speedy and reliable communication of infor<Col N="1504" /> mation at all levels of the system; customised attention for patients, in which their dignity and right to clear information is observed by all in the hospital service who come in contact with them, as well as structures that allow patients to feed their experience of the services back to providers; and an emphasis on measuring the real outcomes of our hospital services for patients, so that only the most effective treatments using best practice and evidence-based medicine are provided.</P>
    <P>In terms of the future configuration of services, I have expressed the view that, following on the rationalisation of hospitals in the 1980s and early 1990s, we need to now use all of the facilities at our disposal. In this regard, trends towards the clustering of hospital services across two or more sites have offered a valuable opportunity to reconfigure selected services to the benefit of patients and ensures that all hospitals can discharge their own role to the fullest degree. This approach can secure the future of smaller hospitals while helping to ensure that requirements of quality and sufficient caseload are met as part of an overall drive for high quality services based on best practice.</P>
    <P>Staffing issues are central to this overall quality drive, with particular regard to the need to continue to produce, attract and retain a sufficient number of well qualified and committed people to staff our hospitals. The deliberations of the medical manpower forum, the Commission on Nursing and the ongoing reviews of the work of paramedical staffs have been conducted against the background of these considerations.</P>

      <P>Planning for the Future, which was published in December 1984, set out the fundamental objectives of policy on the care of the mentally ill which have been adopted by successive Governments since that time. The Green Paper on Mental Health, published in 1992, reviewed these objectives and concluded that the psychiatric services were making good progress towards achieving them. The priorities for the development of the psychiatric services were further developed and put in the context of a framework for the development of all health services in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, published in 1994. The policy objectives first set down in Planning for the Future are still valid today and I am satisfied that progress continues to be made towards their achievement. The Mental Health Bill, 1999, which was published today, will represent a further significant development in mental health services and I have made funding available in 2000 for the implementation of the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> When account is taken of the 1999 developments, the numbers of new residential and day places required will be in the region of 1,353 and 752 respectively.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has announced its intention to clear the backlog in relation to residential, respite and day services over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major acceleration of the investment programme in the area of services for persons with an intellectual disability. The additional funding being provided in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services, including residential, respite and day services, with an annual cost of £35 million. Because of the timeframe involved in bringing all of the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the actual cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 2000 for the services to £38.7 million, increasing to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>I am also making available £80 million capital over the next three years to accelerate the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support these services. A total of £30 million will be made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and the balance of £10 million in 2002. In accordance with normal practice, a revenue allocation commensurate with the capital investment in the services will also be made over this period.</P>

      <P>My Department's casemix programme collects information in relation to both hospital activity, and its associated costs, in 30 public hospitals which participate in casemix.</P>
      <P>Casemix, which involves the monitoring and comparison of costs and activity between hospitals, classifies patients into discrete classes or groups which share common clinical attributes and similar patterns of resource use. The system currently in use in Ireland categorises activity into 495 diagnosis related groups, DRGs.</P>
      <P>Casemix estimates an average cost per case for all cases in each DRG, but does not break down costs to the level of individual procedures on a hospital by hospital basis. Costs are averaged over all hospitals in the casemix programme, rather than by individual hospital, in order to produce meaningful national data.</P>
      <P>The information in relation to the procedures requested by the Deputy are detailed as follows. Data relates to 1997, the latest date for which information is available. Hip replacement: DRG 209 relates to major joint and limb reattachment procedures of the lower extremity, including total, partial and revised hip, knee and ankle replacements. The average cost per case is £4,378. Cardiac bypass: DRG 106 and DRG 107 relate to coronary bypass, with and without catheterisation, with an average cost per case of £9,377 and £6,043 respectively. Cataract operation: DRG 39 includes lens procedures, including cataracts, and the average cost is £1,017 per case. Grommets: DRG 62 relates to myringotomy with tube insertion in children under 17 years and the average cost is £720 per case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Caring About Women and Cancer report is the result of a trans-European investigation undertaken by a pan-European programme surveying approximately 15,000 women with cancer. The initiative was developed under the guidance of a European core advisory board and was conducted in each of the participating countries, including Ireland, under the guidance of national advisory boards which adapted the programme locally.</P>
      <P>The report contained a number of recommendations, including: the need to raise public awareness of cancer; the need for a high level of participation in screening programmes; the need for women to take responsibility for their own health; the need for appropriate treatment as soon as possible following diagnosis and the need for adequate communication between patients and medical staff regarding treatment.</P>
      <P>The national cancer strategy had commenced addressing these issues prior to the publication of this report. Since the commencement of the implementation of the strategy considerable resources have been allocated to improving the cancer services available in this country, from diagnosis through to palliative care services. Some £26 million was allocated between 1997 and 1999 to implement the action plan for the national cancer strategy, and I have provided a further £11.464 million under the strategy for 2000.</P>
      <P>Considerable dedicated funding has been allocated to histopathology and cytology services over the past three years. Under the national cancer strategy I have allocated over £1.5 million for the provision of additional consultant histopathologists and additional cytoscreeners. Preparation for phase one of the national cervical screening programme is progressing well and it is anticipated that it will commence screening in the early part of 2000.</P>
      <P>It is important to note from the Caring About Women and Cancer report, that once women present for treatment, the vast majority of women are very happy with the services provided. I am confident that the improvements to date under the national cancer strategy will further enhance the services and achieve the ultimate goal of reducing the number of deaths from cancer.</P>

The patients charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients rights and it is my intention to ensure that service providers continue to build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest date for which detailed validated information is available in respect of waiting lists is 30 September 1999. On that date there were 33,555 persons on public in-patient waiting lists. This represents a reduction of 3,328, or 9%, in the first three quarters of this year. Following the industrial action by nurses, my Department sought an estimate from agencies of total in-patient waiting lists as on 31 October and the total figure estimated by agencies on that date was 37,326.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decrease of 9% in in-patient waiting lists between January and September of this year demonstrates that agencies were making solid progress and that the approach recommended by the review group on the waiting list initiative was paying dividends. While the nurses industrial action has since adversely affected the situation, I am committed to pursuing the policies proposed by the review group so that waiting lists and waiting times can be reduced while also addressing the underlying causes of their existence. I am also working with agencies to ensure that any backlogs created by the strike are being dealt with speedily. My Department has written to the relevant agencies to emphasise the importance of meeting the activity targets set out in their service <Col N="1512" /> plan for 1999, and has met with them to address how best to deal with the backlogs.</P>
    <P>I have allocated a further £23.5 million to agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2000. This represents an increase of 17.5% over the £20 million allocated in 1999, and is almost three times the amount allocated by the previous Government in 1997.</P>

      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is, therefore, in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours, and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items.</P>

      <P>Article 4 (b) of the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I.

      <Quest>if he will amend the regulations governing tenant purchase, shared ownership and other purchase schemes to allow for house price determination to be based upon construction costs plus inflation instead of at current market value in view of the increase in house prices which have placed the purchase of local authority family homes out of the reach of long-term tenants.</Quest>

      <P>The sale price of houses under the tenant purchase scheme is based on the current market value, as determined by the local authority, together with generous discounts. The market value is discounted by 3% of the value of the house for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum discount of 30% plus a further discount of £3,000 in each case. I consider these terms to be fair both to the tenant purchaser and to the taxpayer who funds the provision of local authority housing and I have no plans to amend them.</P>
      <P>Purchase on a shared ownership basis is also an option in respect of such houses. In the case of the overall operation of the shared ownership scheme, the local authority acquires on the open market the dwelling selected by the shared owner and there is no scope to alter the basis for price determination. The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses at cost price specifically for low income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit in March 1999 following an accident. At the time of his claim he was in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and did not appear to qualify for payment of disability benefit and he was notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>He applied for disability allowance in May 1999. While he satisfied the means criteria, his application was refused as he did not satisfy the medical criteria for the award of this allowance. He was advised of his right to appeal this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He applied for pre-retirement allowance in October 1999 but his claim was disallowed as he did not satisfy the conditions for award at that time. He was advised of this and of his right to appeal. On subsequent re-examination of his disability benefit claim, it transpired that he had entitlement to disability benefit at a reduced rate. This claim has now been put into payment and arrears of disability benefit for the period 4 March 1999 to 6 December 1999, less supplementary welfare allowance paid to him for the period 17 June 1999 to 6 December 1999, amounting to £433.50, will shortly issue to him. The incon<Col N="1524" /> venience resulting from the error in determining his disability benefit entitlement is regretted.</P>
    <P>It has been confirmed that the person concerned is fit for work from 7 December 1999 and he has renewed his entitlement to unemployment assistance from that date. A claim for pre-retirement allowance has again been made and this will be examined and he will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person satisfies the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>No decision has been made to change the manner of payments of SWA to asylum seekers or any other group. Following the recent Government decision that in future the basic needs of asylum seekers may be met through direct rather than cash means, a scheme of direct provision is being drawn up. Direct provision eliminates the need for basic payments and rent supplements by providing the accommodation, goods and services required by the individual directly. When direct provision is introduced asylum seekers may require a residual income maintenance payment to cover personal requisites similar to the &ldquo;comfort payments&rdquo; made to certain people in long-term institutional care. Details have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>A system of direct provision also has been agreed in the UK and will be effective from 1 April 2000.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Applications Centre at Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, is a &ldquo;One-Stop-Shop&rdquo; facility which provides services for asylum seekers in relation to asylum claim processing, health, accommodation, income maintenance and legal services. The Eastern <Col N="1525" /> Health Board &ndash; EHB &ndash; provides income maintenance services on behalf of my Department at the centre. EHB staff at the centre also source emergency accommodation on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they also operate a health screening service from that location.</P>
      <P>The EHB's asylum unit provides both income maintenance and accommodation services at the centre. The level of staffing agreed for the asylum unit at the centre is: two superintendent community welfare officers &ndash; SCWOs; 25 community welfare officers &ndash; CWOs; one office manager; five clerical staff and ten porters.</P>
      <P>There has been no disagreement concerning the number of staff at the unit. In fact, when unions representing staff at the unit recently requested the assignment of ten additional CWOs, management responded by offering a further 15 posts in various grades, including the ten CWO posts requested by the unions. The recent industrial relations problems at the unit centred on health and safety concerns and on the number of staff who would be offered permanent contracts. These matters are now the subject of a Labour Court recommendation which the management side has accepted.</P>
      <P>The asylum unit deals with some 3,000 people in emergency accommodation and the current average of 1,000 new arrivals each month. Staffing and related issues, such as office accommodation, concerning the reception of asylum seekers are kept under constant review. There is a higher ratio of CWOs to clients in the asylum unit than in other health centres because of the different needs of the clients, for instance, in relation to language and translation difficulties. However, because the range and level of services provided in individual health centres differs depending on local needs, direct comparisons of staffing levels are difficult to make.</P>

      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 136 of 14 October 1999. I would like to further clarify the situation in regard to sporting rights. Only the management of the sporting rights reserved to the Land Commission currently rests with Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is the successor in title to the Land Commission and holds title to the sporting rights reserved to the Irish Land Commission. As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands I do not hold title to sporting rights reserved to the Land Commission and accordingly I am not in a position to transfer title to sporting rights by way of purchase or otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is the practice with Dúchas that, where there is no conservation reason for maintaining an interest and where the sporting rights are not leased to a third party, no objection is raised if a landowner applies for cancellation of the sporting rights reserved to the Land Commission. Application to extinguish the sporting rights reserved may be made to the Registrar of Titles under section 18 of the Land Act, 1965. It would be a matter for the landowner to make application under the Land Act, 1965, and to comply with any legal requirements in relation to such application.</P>
      <P>I have recently received some further correspondence dated 21 November 1999 from the person in question regarding sporting rights, grazing rights and the title over an area of commonage in County Mayo. Most of the matters raised in the correspondence are of a complex legal nature in relation to title, succession and the exercise of various property rights on certain lands. These are issues which lie outside my remit but I have requested my officials to investigate the conservation status of the lands in question and I will write to the Deputy on this aspect.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Children Bill, 1999, is to provide a statutory framework to underpin the further development of the juvenile justice system over the coming years. Successful implementation will entail the proper targeting of resources over time into areas where they will be most effective. It is also the case that the application of additional funding to some areas of the system may result in savings elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In that context, the estimated annual costs that have been identified for my Department to fully implement the legislation will amount to somewhere in the region of £9.85 million after a number of years. In addition, there will be non-recurring capital costs.</P>
      <P>The Bill also has spending implications for the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.</P>

In accordance with this commitment, I requested the Working Group on a Courts Commission to consider the Establishment of a drug courts system in Ireland and as recommended by the working group, I established a planning committee to prepare for the introduction of a pilot project in the District Court in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The report of the Drug Court Planning Committee, which was chaired by Judge Hogan, was received by me in early August 1999 and is currently being considered by my Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 to 349, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that emergency classification is given to calls of top priority, whether received as 999 calls or otherwise. They are calls reporting the activities of armed persons and-or robberies. Reports of bombs, incendiary devices, radioactivity or hazardous chemicals are also classed as emergency as are reports of aircraft in trouble, train accidents and prison breaks.</P>
      <P>It is Garda Síochána policy that all calls received at a station relating to crimes or incidents are recorded on the command and control system, with particular emphasis on emergency-priority calls.</P>
      <P>Because of the way management reports are programmed on the command and control system, it is not possible to state the average response time to emergency calls.</P>
      <P>It can be stated however, that 88% of emergency calls for the Dublin metropolitan region were dealt with within 15 minutes during the month of October.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it has not been possible to compile the figures relating to the number of emergency calls received by the command and control centre, with a yearly and monthly breakdown but as soon as I have those figures, I will forward them to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, the number of incidents, in the various Garda divisions of the Dublin metropolitan region, for which emergency calls were received, for the month of October 1999, is as follows:</P>

      <P>There were 349 convicted sex offenders in Irish prisons on Tuesday, 8 December 1999. There are currently ten offenders undergoing the dedicated group sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison. In addition, the probation and welfare service and the psychology service in my Department provide one to one counselling to offenders. <Col N="1538" /> The number of offenders undergoing one to one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. Such counselling can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling. The treatment outlined above is available to all sex offenders including paedophiles.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that it would be possible to have a dedicated sex offender group treatment programme in place in the Curragh Place of Detention this year. However, the absence of generic psychological services there will delay the establishment of a full programme until next year.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service and the psychology service of my Department are recruiting extra staff at present. It is intended that the Curragh Place of Detention will have priority in the allocation of resources to enable the introduction of a dedicated sex offender group treatment programme in the prison, similar to the programme which has been operating successfully in Arbour Hill for a number of years.</P>
      <P>I have instructed the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of all sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. In the meantime, all convicted sex offenders, are invited to avail of the specialised sex offender group treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison regardless of the institution in which they are detained.</P>

      <Quest>the number of prisoners; the number and proportion of prisoners with a recognised mental disturbance or disorder on admittance to prison; the number and proportion of prisoners admitted with a history of suicide attempts; the extent to which a psychiatric or psychological assessment is automatically made of each prisoner on admittance; and the number of psychiatrists and psychologists working on a full-time basis with prisons.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 2,769 prisoners in custody on Thursday, 9 December 1999. It is not possible to quantify the number and proportion of these prisoners with a recognised mental disturbance or disorder on admittance or those with a history of suicide attempts. I can confirm, however, that a study, of randomly selected prisoners undertaken in Mountjoy in 1992-93 has shown that up to 5% of committals to prison are persons who demonstrate psychiatric problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the committal procedure, a document known as a committal details form is completed. A prison reception officer enters the prisoners details on this form. The information entered is quite detailed and includes particulars in relation to the current sentence and previous committal periods as well as personal details such as date of birth, address, next of kin, marital <Col N="1539" /> status, physical features, drug and psychiatric history.</P>
    <P>A medical orderly or prison nurse also interviews each prisoner on committal. The medical orderly or nurse takes medical details from the prisoner including particulars on his GP if any, current medication and medical history. The prisoner is also questioned regarding his or her history of drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric illness and previous self-harm. The details are recorded on a medical record form</P>
    <P>The accuracy of the personal information entered on the committal and medical forms relies largely on the willingness of the prisoner to give full and frank details. The provision of any immediate follow up medical or other attention will often depend on the provision by the prisoner of accurate information.</P>
    <P>Each prisoner is seen by the prison doctor within 24 hours of committal. In the event that the doctor considers, on the basis of his examination or the details declared by the prisoner, that further specialist referral, including psychiatric referral, is necessary then this is arranged. In the case where a prisoner declares a medical issue requiring verification or consultation with other medical agencies in the community, the prison, doctor would make the appropriate enquiries having obtained the prisoner's consent to do this.</P>
    <P>Data is not maintained in a manner which would enable the prison authorities to give an accurate picture of the number of prisoners who had a history of suicide attempts. The information is maintained on each prisoner's file and is not collated centrally. As I have already stated, the accuracy of the personal information gained relies largely on the willingness of the prisoner to give full and frank details. The same would largely be true, if it came to an estimation of the number of suicide attempts amongst those who never entered the prison system.</P>
    <P>There are nine full-time and one half-time psychologists in my Department's psychology service working on a permanent basis in the prison system. The service is recruiting extra staff at present. In December 1998 I established a group to examine and report on the future needs, structure and organisation of the psychology service. The report of this group was presented to me in August this year and has recently been published. The report contains 15 key recommendations including the recruitment of a further ten psychologists to ensure a minimum strength of 20. I have asked the director general of the Prisons Service to examine the report with a view to its implementation as appropriate.</P>
    <P>There are no psychiatrists assigned to prisons on a full time basis. The psychiatric service is provided to the prisons and places of detention by visiting psychiatrists employed by the health boards. The psychiatric service of the Eastern Health Board at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, provide regular weekly counselling and treatment sessions at the Dublin prisons. <Col N="1540" /> Offenders who, in the opinion of the psychiatrist and the prison medical officer are in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment, may be transferred by ministerial order to either the Central Mental Hospital or a district mental hospital. In practice all such transfers occur to the Central Mental Hospital. I recently announced the establishment of a multi-disciplinary group to conduct an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. The terms of reference of the review group include an examination of the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners.</P>

      <P>Precise statistics on the number and proportion of prisoners admitted who are drug abusers are difficult to collate. Statistics in each prison are based on voluntary information supplied by the offender and rely largely on the willingness of the prisoner to give full and frank details. On committal to prison each prisoner is interviewed to establish personal, medical, psychiatric and drug history. Subject to this important qualification, an estimate of the proportion of prisoners admitted to the committal prisons who are recorded as drug abusers is set out in the following table.</P>

    <P>*Since the inauguration of Castlerea Prison as a committal prison in September 1998, five committals were active drug users. There are no active drug users in Castlerea at present.</P>
    <P>In recent years, two studies have examined more closely the prevalence of drug abuse among the prison population. The first, a study of Irish female prisoners, published in 1996 showed that 60 of the 100 women interviewed had taken drugs at some stage in their lives. Fifty-nine of the 60 women were still taking drugs on their committal to prison. The majority &ndash; 92% &ndash; of the drug addicts were chronic users i.e. they used drugs more than or equal to once a day. One in four <Col N="1541" /> of the women were thought to have an alcohol problem by the interviewing doctor.</P>
    <P>The second, Dr. Paul O'Mahony's report entitled Mountjoy Prisoners; A Sociological and Criminological Profile researched drug misuse in prisoners there. Published in June 1997, Dr. O'Mahony's report states that, in ten years since 1986, the proportion of the prison population that had used drugs other than cannabis had more than doubled from 37% to 77% and the proportion that could be described as having a serious dependency on a hard drug also more than doubled from 31% to 63%. The number who said they drank alcohol when free had <Col N="1542" /> reduced however, from 87% in 1986 to 68% in 1996. Some 19% admitted an alcohol problem or had been in treatment for alcoholism.</P>
    <P>A third in depth study in relation to drug misuse in the prison population is presently being conducted, on behalf of my Department, by the Health Research Board, under the supervision of Ms Rosalyn Moran, head of it's drug misuse research division.</P>
    <P>The number of prisoners attending the Probation and Welfare Service, the psychology service and the psychiatric service in the committal prisons either for treatment in relation to their addiction or other therapy is outlined in the table below:</P>

    <P>*Psychologist and psychiatrist visit once a week. No figure available for the number of drug addicts receiving therapy.</P>
    <P>**Offenders attending the psychologist and psychiatrist may be repeat attendees, therefore it is not possible to give an accurate figure. The reasons for visits are subject to medical confidentiality.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In the other places of detention, including the three open centres, there is a range of support programmes for drug users, including counselling from the Probation and Welfare Service and the psychology service and links with community-based treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>Addiction counselling is undertaken primarily in the prison service by the Probation and Welfare Service. The degree of counselling varies from prison to prison. The counselling provided by the Probation and Welfare Service is delivered in conjunction with other partners such as Coolmine and the Talbot Centre in St. Patrick's and the AA, NA, Youth Action Project Ballymun, Coolmine and the Anna Liffey Centre in Mountjoy. The Probation and Welfare Service in Wheatfield works alongside the Ballyfermot Local Drugs Task Force, Coolmine, Narcotics Anonymous, the Ballymun Youth Action Project, Killenarden Drugs Programme and Rialto Drugs Awareness Group.</P>
    <P>In addition, the probation and welfare service in Mountjoy co-ordinates an intensive seven week drug rehabilitation programme in the health care unit. This programme commenced in July 1996 and 225 prisoners have undertaken the treatment to date. A second, 11 week, abstinence based drug rehabilitation programme will commence in the health care unit in January 2000.</P>
    <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved earlier this year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan. I have asked the director general of the Prisons Service to establish a national steering group on drug treatment for prisoners. The director general has agreed to chair the steering group himself to signal the importance that is attached by Government to this issue.</P>

      <P>I have referred to the establishment of the central directorate for the dispersal of asylum seekers and direct provision on a number of occasions recently in this House.</P>
      <P>In response to the situation where the Eastern Health Boare could not source adequate accommodation for asylum seekers in the Dublin area, the Government decided that there was no option but to arrange for dispersal to locations throughout the country and that a central directorate should be established to arrange for such dispersal.</P>
      <P>While the immediate task of the directorate is to ensure that the housing needs of asylum seekers are met as I and the Government are conscious that the essential requirement of shelter must be the first priority, the directorate is currently consulting with Departments, State agencies and non-governmental organisations with a view to devising a planned and orderly system of dispersal which will of course be sensitive to the needs of not alone the family unit but to the cultures and ethnic background of the applicants. It will be a primary function of the directorate to ensure that the facilities available to those in the greater Dublin area will be also available to those dispersed and proper structures and procedures will be put in place to allow for its smooth operation. Dispersal will not in any way disadvantaged those who are located in areas outside of Dublin. Such locations will be chosen where the support services for the asylum seeker are in place or can be put in place without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy context of the decision of the Government to plan for a system of providing directly for the needs of asylum seekers is the range of measures taken in other EU countries to control illegal immigration and to manage the processing of cases of those who seek asylum and refugee status and in particular the decision of the UK to move to a system of direct provision by April 2000. Given that we maintain a common travel area with the UK which is of enormous value and relevance to the Island of Ireland and Irish people generally, a decision of this character by the UK has to be taken into con<Col N="1544" /> sideration very seriously by any Irish Government.</P>
      <P>The introduction of direct provision in this State will simply bring us in line with other member states. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum matters is by far the best approach and in introducing this system I am satisfied that it will represent a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum population. There is a widespread assumption that direct provision automatically represents a lesser standard of service to asylum seekers, but I can assure the House that the introduction of this system will follow careful planning and investigation.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 9 November to establish a central directorate to arrange for the dispersal of asylum seekers to locations throughout the country and to plan for a system of direct provision for their basic needs. A system of vouchers is only one option to be considered by the directorate which will be consulting widely with relevant Department agencies and non-governmental organisations before making recommendations on the most appropriate system of providing directly for asylum seeker needs.</P>
      <P>A system of direct provision will for the most part represent a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for funding suitable accommodation, for providing health and education services and other essential needs. Genuine asylum seekers who are actually fleeing persecution, will I am satisfied, welcome this service and are unlikely to view it as a diminution in the quality of the services provided by the State, given that one of its purposes is to prevent fraud for which the innocent as well as the guilty seem to stand indicted by those who are hostile to immigrants generally. Unscrupulous persons who use the umbrella of asylum to defraud the State naturally prefer a cash based system. The system will not alone provide for the basic needs of asylum seekers in a fair and effective manner but will send out a message to those engaged in fraudulent activity that the States responsibility is to the genuine asylum seeker and not to those who circumvent immigration controls simply to cash in on what may be viewed as a generous welfare system.</P>

      <P>When I became Minister for Justice on 26 June 1997, I found that the immigration-asylum service, given the problems facing it, was totally under resourced. Twenty two staff were working on thousands of applications which had built up over the previous years. They were <Col N="1545" /> doing their level best but in truth they could not cope with the administrative burden placed on them. The Government of which I am a member immediately decided on taking up office that this issue needed urgent attention. We immediately set about taking that action.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision of July 1997 and the resolution of the industrial relations problems on the use of retired public servants, the Department of Finance gave sanction for 72 posts on 27 February 1998 to put together an asylum task force. The staff were sourced, comprehensive training in conjunction with the UNHCR was provided, systems were put in place and operations commenced on 5 May 1998.</P>
      <P>On recommendation of the reconvened interdepartmental Committee of Asylum, Immigration and Related matters and to maintain the momentum in the processing, the Government decided on 20 July 1998 to approve a further 72 posts to concentrate on processing the cases throughout the appeal stage and to provide for the needs that exist in immigration and citizenship division and aliens registration office as a consequence of the administrative burden casued by the influx of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The number of staff now involved in all the arrangements for processing of applications in respect of asylum claims is 120 of which 25 part time employees represent 15 posts.</P>
      <P>In addition, on 3 November 1999 the Government decided, <i>inter alia, </i>on an increase in staff for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which would be sufficient to discharge the Department's role in relation to planning for and implementation of direct provision and to expand the asylum operations and policy and the immigration and citizenship areas of the Department. On foot of this decision the Department of Finance approved 120 additional posts on 25 November.</P>
      <P>I cannot compare the resources allocated to the refugee applications centre in Mount Street with the staff workloan in terms of applicants in other similar offices dealing with Irish applicants as by definition no Irish persons were eligible to apply for refugee status.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was transferred from Mountjoy Prison to Cork prison on 27 November 1999 for operational reasons. The need to transfer prisoners arises from time to time particularly in the light of overcrowding in the committal prisons. The person referred to has not objected to his detention in Cork and has not applied for a transfer back to the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>As I have explained to the Deputy on two occasions in the past month, the person referred to was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 8 June, 1999 for driving related offences and is due for release with remission on 8 March, 2000. He was transferred to Shelton Abbey on 17 June 1999. I authorised weekly renewable temporary release from Shelton Abbey for this person on 26 July 1999. Arrangements were made for him to renew his temporary release by signing on weekly in Mountjoy Prison for his convenience. However, he failed to comply with this condition of his temporary release and accordingly went unlawfully at large. The Garda was informed and he was later arrested and returned to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am not prepared to authorise any further temporary release for this person at this time. However, his case will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his-her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he-she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on <Col N="1548" /> appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application. In so far as consistency of sentencing is concerned, I consider it important to mention that the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a review of what appears to the director to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
    <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Its report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the judiciary and, this year, I made £60,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issuse of sentencing has been examined by the Institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes provision for meetings of District Court Judges to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.</P>
    <P>The sixth report of the working group on a courts commission also made reference to the issue of sentencing. The working group suggests that judicial education could be addressed by a judicial standards body in liaison with the Judicial Studies Institute. This new body could, <i>inter alia,</i> provide a monitoring and analytical service on matters such as sentencing along the lines of the Judicial Commission in New South Wales. The House will be aware in this regard, that the Chief Justice has established a judicial committee to consider, <i>inter alia,</i> the recommendations made in the working group report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368, 369 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>In April of this year, a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced for FÁS participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. at least 12 months continuously unemployed. This allowance was later approved for eligible VTOS participants who had been in receipt of their respective payment for at least 12 months also on the same basis prior to joining VTOS.</P>
      <P>The students referred to in the questions have not been on the live register for the required length of time to be eligible to receive this bonus payment.</P>
      <P>The bonus was introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes. The effect of the incentive in prioritising access for long-term unemployed would be dissipated if the bonus were applied equally to all participants.</P>

    <P>I am aware that there are still substantial centres of population that do not yet have access to an educational psychological service for primary schools. However, the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service Agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; has now begun. Areas where there is currently no provision accorded priority within the overall development plan of NEPS.</P>

      <P>At present approximately 700 primary schools have access to a psychologist through the National Educational Psychological Service Agency &ndash; NEPS.</P>
      <P>The expansion of the NEPS is now beginning. Interviews for 25 new psychologists have recently been completed and it is hoped that the new appointees will take up their positions early in the new year. Interviews for a further 25 psychologists are scheduled to begin during the first half of January 2000.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of a quality educational psychological service that will adequately meet the needs of our children and young people. It is essential, therefore, that the expansion of NEPS should proceed in a phased, orderly and equitable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall allocation of psychologists to the regions will be based on the projected student numbers in each. In the interests of equity, it is proposed that each cohort of newly recruited psychologists will be distributed equally among the regions, including the South-Eastern Region, until each has reached its target number. Within each region and within each county, the priorities for expansion will be agreed by NEPS in consultation with local interests, including other pro<Col N="1554" /> viders of psychological services and the main client groups.</P>
    <P>The management team in NEPS has been collecting relevant data about each county and will supplement this with local discussions, beginning immediately after Christmas. Such discussions will be arranged with local interests in the city and county of Waterford. It is likely that areas with a high level of disadvantage will be identified as priorities in the initial expansion phase.</P>

      <P>I take it that what the Deputy is referring to in his question is that there will be adequate post-primary accommodation available in the Lucan area to cater for output from the Lucan Educate Together national school. The position is that the number of pupils leaving Lucan Educate Together national school in the coming years will be quite small. There are currently four existing post-primary schools catering for pupils from the Lucan-Balgaddy area and it is expected that these schools will cater for the demand from the multi-denominational school for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>My Department has no plans at present to build an additional school in the Lucan area. However, in accordance with normal practice for major urban areas, the situation in Lucan will continue to be monitored to ensure that all pupils seeking a post-primary school place can be facilitated.</P>

      <P>Boards of management are charged with the direct governance of schools and as such are responsible for ensuring that schools meet the prescribed minimum requirement of being open for 183 days each school year. Department circular 11/95, Time in School, advised school authorities that in order to guarantee that its school is in operation for the prescribed minimum number of days, each managerial authority, in planning the school year, must make allowance for days on which the school may have to be closed due to unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>School authorities therefore retain discretion in the matter of school closures and given that there is scope for adjusting the school timetable during the year, it is expected that boards would make every possible effort to ensure that any closures necessitated by prevailing circumstances would be compensated for by a revision of the school timetable for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>If a matter relating to the length of the school year of any particular school is raised with my Department, my officials will correspond with the school authorities with a view to ensuring that the school complies with the minimum requirement.</P>

I have applied the staffing schedule for the retention of teaching posts in Gaelscoileanna to schools in Gaeltacht areas where teaching is through the medium of Irish for the 1999/ 2000 and subsequent school years.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have been concerned for some time about the number of large classes in the primary system, and have been examining ways to target additional teaching resources to those schools with the greatest need in this area. The new staffing schedule, which issued in April last, has been structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>However, as you know, the staffing schedule has traditionally been applied on the basis of the previous year's enrolment figures, and this continues to be the case. Therefore, the schools which initially benefited from the new schedule are those who qualified for an additional post in the 1999-2000 school year. Such schools are in a position to organise classes in such a way as to ensure that there are no longer any very large classes.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at St. Margaret's national school, Curracloe on 30 September 1998 of 108 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and three mainstream class teachers for the current school year. In addition the school has the services of a remedial teacher. Therefore, there is no basis for the appointment of an additional teacher at the school for the current school year. The accommodation brief for the proposed extension at this school is being finalised and my Department will be in contact with the school shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools was developed by my Department in consultation with partners in Education and other relevant interests. This programme is called Walk Tall. The development took place in a small number of primary schools during the school years 1996-97 and 1997-98. On the basis of a positive evaluation of the programme the associated detailed educational resource materials were designed and printed before the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>It was decided to disseminate the programme to all primary schools over a two-year period beginning in early 1999. This dissemination process commenced earlier this year and the programme has now been introduced to approximately 1,150 primary schools.</P>
      <P>There is a support team of seven teacher trainers, including a national project officer, involved in the dissemination process. The administration of the process is located in West Dublin Education Centre which works in co-operation with education centres throughout the country. The detailed educational resource materials are for each class level in primary schools. These are provided free of charge to schools as the programme is being introduced and after participation by the teaching staffs of the schools in one-day training seminars. In addition to these training seminars, the provision of further longer training courses for teachers has commenced. It is intended that these longer courses will be available to teachers on an on-going basis. Fifteen such courses have been held this year.</P>
      <P>The On My Own Two Feet substance misuse prevention education programme for post-primary schools was developed by the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children in co-operation with Mater Dei counselling centre. Its introduction to schools commenced early in 1995 and it now reaching the end of a period of dissemination at the end of which it will be revised with reference to curriculum changes which are being considered for the junior cycle of post-primary schooling.</P>
      <P>The programme consists of a set of detailed educational resource materials and associated in-career development for teachers on the implementation of the programme in schools. The aim of the programme is the development of the personal and social skills of students in saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the misuse of substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire programme and the associated in-career development for teachers emphasise the importance of knowledge, attitudes, values, decision making and social competency in the <Col N="1559" /> prevention of substance misuse. In particular the aim is to develop a positive view of themselves among students and an awareness of how they are influenced.</P>
    <P>In-career development for teachers was, and is, an important feature of the programme. This consists of substantial training courses, each lasting for approximately 50 hours spread over about three months. Since early 1995, over 1,600 post-primary teachers have attended these courses to date.</P>
    <P>The NCCA has prepared guidelines for SPHE for the junior cycle of post-primary schooling. SPHE would subsume programmes such as On My Own Two Feet. Details of the phasing-in arrangements for this are currently being finalised.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that the psychological service for the South Eastern Health Board provided for this school that was withdrawn in September 1999. For the moment, the National Educational Psychological Service, is not yet in a position to provide the school with a service.</P>
      <P>However, I share the Deputy's concern for the welfare of the pupils of the school, and I am confident that it will be possible to provide some help before too long. The expansion of the NEPS agency has now begun. Interviews for 25 new psychologists have recently been completed and it is hoped that the new appointees will take up their positions early in the New Year. Interviews for a further 25 psychologists are scheduled to begin during the first half of January 2000.</P>
      <P>Within each region and within each county, the priorities for expansion will be agreed by NEPS in consultation with local interests, including other providers of psychological services and the main client groups. The management team in NEPS has been collecting relevant data about each county and will supplement this with local discussions, beginning immediately after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools such as the School of the Holy Spirit may well need the support of both educational and clinical psychologists. The role of NEPS psychologists will be to provide a consultative and supportive service to schools. Wherever possible, children and young people will be helped in schools by their teachers with the advice and help <Col N="1560" /> of educational psychologists. The NEPS psychologists will also work individually with a number of students. Students who have difficulties such as severe emotional disturbance or autism, that require detailed multi-disciplinary assessment, family intervention or long-term therapeutic counselling, will continue to be referred on to specialist clinical services.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that detailed discussions between NEPS and the principal of the Holy Spirit School will begin as soon as possible. The aim will be to establish which part of the psychological support work for the school is appropriate to NEPS and to arrange for a phased transfer of such responsibility.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 393 together.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy Hogan is one of a group of schools which have refrained from appointing escorts to their special transport services pending the outcome of discussions between my Department and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. The discussions in question were aimed at addressing concerns which had been expressed by some schools at taking on responsibility for the escort scheme. Particularly the administrative burden involved.</P>
      <P>The funding allocations made to all schools in respect of the escort scheme were based on an assumed escort duty of six hours per day for each escort and provided for the employment of escorts for the full school year from September 1999 to June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the discussions with the national association, my Department has now written to all the schools in question advising them that savings arising from escort duties being shorter than the six hours per day provided for in their allocations and savings arising from the later than anticipated appointment of the escorts, may be <Col N="1561" /> used by schools to acquire administrative assistance with the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the savings in question will be of significant assistance in enabling the schools in question to secure any administrative support they require to implement the scheme.

      <Quest>the funding mechanisms in place to help persons attempting to enrol in full-time college courses; the funding available for women who have been out of the education system for a considerable period of time and are attempting to enhance their employment opportunities through additional third level education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the Department of Education and Science meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending <Col N="1562" /> full-time undergraduate courses, other than ESF aided courses in the institutes of technology, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>Tuition fees are not payable on ESF funded certificate and diploma courses in the institutes of technology or on ESF funded post leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>In addition the Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students: higher education grants scheme; Vocational Education Committees' scholarship scheme; European Social Fund-aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees; maintenance grant scheme for students attending European Social Fund aided post leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. Students who are repeating a year at the same level are generally not eligible.</P>
      <P>However, since 1994 the higher education grants scheme and Vocational Education Committees scholarship scheme have included a concession for second chance students returning to college after a break of at least five years having previously pursued, but not completed, a third level course. This concession allows such students to be funded again for periods of study at the same level. Prior to 1994, a student did not receive financial assistance until they had completed the equivalent amount of time spent on their original course, irrespective of the length of time, which had elapsed between the two periods of college attendance. There are similar arrangements applying for second chance students under the free fees initiative.</P>
      <P>As part of a major funding initiative at third level, the higher, non-adjacent rate of grant is now being paid to all eligible mature students under the student support schemes with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>All of the funding mechanisms set out above are available to women returning to full time education on the same conditions as apply to all candidates.</P>
      <P>On the issue of programmes targeted specifically at women returning to education, I advise the Deputy of the Institute Equality Network Project, arising from the EU programme New Opportunities for Women, which is operational in six Institutes of Technology. Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with specific focus on women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has provided £1.285 million towards targeted initiatives for mature students which encourages access to third <Col N="1563" /> level education. Included in this funding is £100,000 which has been allocated to the Womens Education Research and Resource Centre, based at University College Dublin for the purpose of providing on-campus and outreach access courses throughout the country for women returners who would not otherwise have been readily able to avail of third level education.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs administers a back to education allowance which is available to eligible persons who have been in receipt of certain social welfare payments for at least six months and who wish to pursue approved second or third level education courses.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group which I set up last year to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals in primary schools was recently presented to me.</P>
      <P>I myself recently met with the INTO to discuss the recommendations of the report and further discussions are continuing between officials of my Department and the INTO to examine the issues involved.</P>
      <P>There is of course already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions. The middle management structures in schools which have been developed in recent years enable the principal to delegate a number of functions to other teachers. In particular, many schools have access to secretarial and caretaking services, and I have recently announced substantial improvements in the level of assistance in these areas.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year. The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools and principals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation raised by the Deputy. In the past, responsibility for the assessment of national school children rested with the health boards or with voluntary organisations under their aegis. Whilst real progress is being made in the recruitment of additional psychologists for the National Educational Psychological Service agency, the agency will not be up to its full projected strength until the end of its five-year development phase. This has led to a lacuna in provision of assessments in some areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to the development of a quality educational psychological service that will adequately meet the needs of our children and young people. It is essential, therefore, that the expansion of NEPS should proceed in a phased and orderly way, to allow time for newly <Col N="1566" /> appointed psychologists to have an adequate induction period before being assigned to their areas. Earlier in the year, therefore, I wrote to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, drawing his attention to the situation, and asking him to request the health boards to attempt to continue providing an assessment service during the development phase of NEPS. He readily agreed to do this and I know that he has written to the health boards about the matter.</P>
    <P>A management committee oversees the overall development of NEPS. This consists of officials from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and of the health boards. The management committee has also identified the issue raised by the Deputy as one that requires an early solution. The committee is developing an action plan for co-ordination of the educational and clinical psychological services. The production of national guidelines will be followed by local discussions so that satisfactory arrangements for the provision of assessments can be made in each area.</P>

      <Quest>if he will compare the capitation allowance paid by his Department for pupils at primary schools with that paid for pupils at each type of second level school; the reason heat, light and other costs at different schools should necessarily be different; and the reason for the differential between these capitation payments.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The available data do not facilitate valid comparisons to be made between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and second level. However, it is accepted that maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools. In general, second level schools are larger than primary schools and this would lead to higher unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</P>
      <P>The second level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of expenditures. Second level schools provide a broader curriculum, including technical subjects where the cost of materials may be greater than at primary level. In addition, specialist equipment and rooms are required for some subjects, leading to higher maintenance-replacement costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997 the per capita funding allocated to primary and secondary schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources. The standard capitation grant at primary level was <Col N="1567" /> increased by £5 in 1999 and £10 in 1999 which brought the standard grant to £60 per pupil. In addition, the grant will be increased by a further increase of £11 next year. The told increase since 1997 will, at that point, be nearly two thirds. In relation to secondary schools, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 this year with a further increase of £8 planned for next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 402 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>

    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another <Col N="1568" /> 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year.

Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant. The allocation for 1999 in respect of this scheme is £5.6 million.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year. The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools with regard to caretaking and secretarial services.</P>
