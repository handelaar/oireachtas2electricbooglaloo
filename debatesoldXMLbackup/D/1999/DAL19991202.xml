      <P>Before we come to the Order of the House, I call on the Taoiseach who, I understand, wants to make an announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that the British and Irish Governments have today completed the requirements, as specified in Article 4 of the British-Irish Agreement, for the entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have this morning exchanged notifications of the completion in each jurisdiction of the requirements for entry into force of the Agreement. Accordingly, as prescribed in Article 4 (2) of the Agreement, following the exchange of the notifications, the Agreement has now entered into force. So also have the supplementary Agreements establishing the North/South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the North/ South Implementation Bodies.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General confirmed to the Government earlier that the British-Irish Agreement had entered into force and that the Government was immediately thereafter obliged to ensure that the amendments to the Constitution of Ireland set out in Annex B to the section entitled &ldquo;Constitutional Issues&rdquo; of the Multi-Party Agreement take effect as required by Article 4 (3) of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General also advised on the manner in which the amendments to the Constitution are to take effect, through the declaration provided for in Article 27.7.3WP extended char 1,14 of the Constitution, indicated that he had seen the form of the proposed declaration and advised that it should be made by the Government. This was done. The Government has made the declaration that the State has become obliged, pursuant to the Agreement, to give effect to the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a momentous day. Even though it is not ordered, a Cheann Comhairle, I <Col N="338" /> ask you to allow the representatives of the party leaders to say a brief few words.</P>
      <P>This is a momentous day, as the Taoiseach has said, for the people of Northern Ireland, the Republic and Great Britain, many of whom have suffered down the years and continue to suffer.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we would congratulate the Government today for what it has done. I have just come from Iveagh House where the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Mandelson, signed the necessary papers to bring into force another element of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>We must now build on what has happened today. We must build on the economic, social and political arrangements and agreements which we are setting in place. This is a great day for Ireland and I am mindful of the fact that this Agreement has come into force without the bloodshed, civil war and fighting which my granduncle, Michael Collins, faced when he came back from Downing Street in 1921. I hope all of us here will benefit from what has happened, that the young people of Ireland will realise the work of all who have played their part down the years in bringing about this peace, the Governments, Ministers and people who have gone to their reward. I hope that as we move into the new millennium we have seen the end of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely and warmly congratulate the Taoiseach for his part and the part played by members of his Government and congratulate his predecessors and members of former Governments also on bringing us to a day which really is momentous. We use the words &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and &ldquo;momentous&rdquo; too freely in this House but nobody could deny the correctness of the use of those words today.</P>
      <P>For most of us it was unthinkable just a short number of years ago that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution would be amended with such little fuss. Today we have triggered a number of significant developments &ndash; a devolved Administration for Northern Ireland truly representative of all the communities and peoples in Northern Ireland; the establishment of North-South bodies linking the national synergies which exist on this island and the removal of a territorial claim on Northern Ireland which was offensive to a large section of the people there. That was achieved without rancour or difficulty. That in itself is significant as it signifies the state of maturity we have reached on this island. I share the hope for peace and prosperity as expressed by Deputy Owen, which every Member of the House harbours in their hearts on this historic day. We reflect the huge optimism and expectation of the people, North and South, for everybody to work through the institutions, to bring about prosperity and to ensure that never again will we see the hurt and harm that has wreaked such havoc across these islands over the past 30 years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> On behalf of the Socialist Party, which is a registered political party on this island, both North and South, I welcome the fact that the futile 30-year paramilitary campaign is at an end. Now that the Northern Ireland political parties &ndash; most of which are conservative parties &ndash; have entered a power-sharing executive, I hope the divided working class communities in the North will come together to build a new and radical working class alternative to the politics of conservatism and sectarianism that have divided them and allowed poverty and suffering to continue for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Owen, Howlin, Sargent and Higgins for their comments. I agree very much with Deputy Owen when she said that this has been achieved without more violence. We have had enough of that. In recent weeks I was reading reports of deaths in Northern Ireland over the past 200 years. Sometimes we forget that when considering the 30 years of conflict in our own generation. When one considers the period from 1798 onwards, the recorded death toll is horrific, even though I am sure that not all such deaths were recorded. Today is a day of enormous significance but we must remember all the people who died and those who suffered, including the families of those who died. We are thinking of them, in particular, today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Irish people for supporting the constitutional change. From today, the new text of Articles 2 and 3 are substituted for the previous Articles, and the new paragraph now stands part of Bunreacht na hÉireann. I hope politicians, both North and South, can make all the insti<Col N="340" /> tutions work. Government and Opposition parties will have an opportunity to do so through the British-Irish Agreement in its various forms. We pledge to use our political skills to do our utmost to ensure that the aspirations of the Good Friday Agreement, that have now been institutionally and constitutionally enacted, will be successfully implemented for the benefit of the people in peace and on the basis of consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on the Government's earlier performance. It can run but it cannot hide. The millennium budget is clearly and tragically a budget with no social vision but with social division. It has laid the foundations for a two-tier society and widens the gap between rich and poor to a frightening extent. I will give the example of a married couple, both of whom work outside the home and earn £100,000 between them per year &ndash; a lot of money. This couple will gain £77 per week from next April. On the other hand, a disabled person will get £4 per week &ndash; £7.80 if they are married. This means that the former couple, who least need it, will receive ten times more as opposed to the latter couple which most people would agree are on the bread line.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the budget is anti-family. It breaks the spirit and, perhaps, the letter of Article 41 of the Constitution. For example, a couple on £45,000 per year with four children where the wife works at home, will pay £34 per week more in tax from next April then a couple who both work outside the home, have no children and earn the same income. If this happened in communist China, which has an anti-child policy, we would probably report it to the UN Commission on Human Rights. The former couple will pay £34 more per week because of the stay at home wife.</P>
      <P>The Government had billions of pounds at its disposal but has succeeded in producing a package which betrays the needy and the disabled and those who look after them. It merits the label of being anti-family, anti-women and anti-children. The Government could not have succeeded better had it deliberately set out to concoct an anti-social cocktail.</P>
      <P>Today is an historic day in constitutional terms as summed up in <i>The Irish Times</i> lead article under the heading &ldquo;Birth of a New Ireland&rdquo;. The article states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representatives of the people who live <Col N="346" /> on this island, nationalist and unionist, men and women of all religions and of none, have forged an understanding as to how they will live together within the territory they share .</P>
    <P>On this day we witness nothing less than the birth of a new Ireland. It is an Ireland which rejects the simplistic and majoritarian politics of the past. It acknowledges the diversity of culture, of race, of religion, of identity which span this island.</P>
    <P>As a footnote to that, we are debating a budget which does not unite but divides rich and poor and between and within families.</P>
    <P>I am not a constitutional lawyer. However, the provisions of the Constitution are relevant to all legislation we pass. Article 41.1 of the Constitution clearly states:</P>
    <P>1ºThe State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>2ºThe State, therefore guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2.1º makes the basic law of the State clear and states:</P>
    <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>Are the provisions of this budget in conflict with the Constitution? It further states: &ldquo;The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A family where the mother stays at home will now pay £34 extra in tax per week. If Article 26 did not specifically exclude a Money Bill, the President would be referring a Finance Bill arising from this budget to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. However, this does not prevent the issue being decided by the Supreme Court, as happened with the Murphy decision in the 1980 Irish Report. This budget breaches the spirit of the Constitution and it may breach the letter of the Constitution &ndash; only the Supreme Court will decide. However, that is not the basic point. It underlines the ease with which the Government is prepared to breach the underlying philosophy of the State, to which we subscribe &ndash; the importance of the family and women in Irish life. All those considerations have been cast aside by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and his Government in this budget.</P>
    <P>The Government probably looked at the tax provisions for child care and steered away from that. I supported the lobby for a reasonable and decent increase in child benefit. However, the <Col N="347" /> budget provision which discriminates against the family and women in the home is a way of introducing a tax based child care system through the back door &ndash; with the difference that one does not have to have children to gain from it. Irrespective of the thinking behind it, the stay-at-home spouse has been marked out and stigmatised. Many would say that in the past they have been unrecognised. We have now gone further and discriminated against them. In the process, the role of women in our society has been diminished. Is this the kind of Ireland we want?</P>
    <P>It is too easy to think of a budget as a means of tinkering with the system. A penny off income tax for the low paid here, an increase in the old age pension there, with the Minister for Finance as a glorified puppetmaster deciding which strings he will pull, who he will help and who he will hurt &ndash; help the old a little, hit smokers a lot, juggle a few numbers and hey presto, we have a budget. However, behind this tinkering and the pulling of strings, a budget should define our society and reflect the image of the Ireland we want to create. In a budget we have to make fundamental judgments which affect the lives of every man, woman and child in the State &ndash; company directors, the unemployed, young people on CE schemes, old age pensioners, carers and their parents. Budgets are not about bar charts and calculations but about the needs of people and our responsibilities to them.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's vision of Ireland in this budget? Will we be a better society because of Budget 2000? Will the young, the old and the carers read the newspapers this morning and be satisfied their needs are being met, or even noticed, by the Minister? There will be more people feeling left out, forgotten and even worse, patronised by some ineffectual change made by the Minister. For all the promises and expectations, this budget will not make a big difference to most people. Yesterday's provisions might have been impressive in the past when we could not afford to make big changes, but not in the era of the Celtic tiger when the Minister has so much money to play around with.</P>
    <P>We have not come to terms with the problems emerging from prosperity. These, coupled with continuing poverty meant that we needed a seismic shift &ndash; instead we got a Band Aid. The budget will help some people a little. However, a great deal more could and should have been done. The only reasonable conclusion is that this budget was a golden opportunity missed. The Minister was in front of an open goal and kicked the ball over the bar.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with our prosperity, but the Government has not come to terms with it and does not know how to handle it in the national interest. To do so requires a view of what is the national interest. Of course we want continuing sustainable development, which the Opposition supports. The Government cannot create this but it can create the environment in which it <Col N="348" /> develops. There is a danger that it can also create an environment in which it can be damaged. This has not been addressed but hopefully it will not materialise. The main priority as regards the national interest was recently mentioned by the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, when he published the Fine Gael plan for the nation. He spoke of the need for a social vision, for the quality of life to which people should aspire. This entails a rise in the standard of living and the quality of life of all people as a national objective. How does this budget contribute to this? For many in our society, the impact will be marginal.</P>
    <P>The next priority is how we take care of our children. There has been a great deal of discussion about child care. In Ireland, State support for children is the worst in Europe, apart from Spain and Portugal. There were great expectations that this would change as a result of yesterday's budget. However, we are still at the bottom of the league. Fine Gael demanded an increase in child benefit to £25 per week for children up to the age of five years and an increase of 25% in the rate of payment for children over five years. We got a pittance of £8 a month&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only the one million children in this country who are affected by these increases, or rather the lack of them. There is the wider issue of the obligation on the Government to ensure well managed, high quality, affordable child minding facilities are available nationally. A reasonable increase in child benefit would have been a major contribution towards this. We did not get it. The other child care measures are so marginal they will not have an impact of any consequence. Child benefit is important to working and stay-at-home parents. However, the increase will not matter to either. Child care is not a priority for this Government. I want to deal with a couple of non-fiscal matters. Many believed that, because there was plenty money available, many of the problems in society could be dealt with. While more and more money is being pumped into the health services, there are more and more problems. When the Government came into office there were approximately 30,000 people on hospital waiting lists; this has now increased to 37,000. Admittedly there was a blip as a result of the nurses' strike which increased the waiting list by a few thousand. Nevertheless, prior to the nurses' strike, the numbers on the waiting lists had increased despite extra money <Col N="349" /> being made available to the health services. Therefore, I must question the Government's lack of competence and inability to manage the money being provided to the health services. The responsibility for this incompetence lies with the Government.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the Land Registry. It is important to our economic well being to have an efficient system of registration of title, yet delays in this service have increased. This body is self-funding and can obtain a surplus turnover. Given the increased economic activity, the office needs extra staff which it cannot obtain without first applying to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Following a wait of approximately six months, the matter is then referred to the Department of Finance which sits on it for another six months. The budget measures will not remove these roadblocks in the system which would not cost extra money. From the point of view of incompetence and bad management, the Government must be condemned and the budget will do nothing to relieve these problems.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that the introduction of the minimum wage next April would have been a prime focus for Government activity in relation to tax measures. Surely those who receive a minimum wage should not be liable for tax. The point has been made that there are many vacancies in businesses in cities and throughout the country. Many of these positions which are low paid will have a much better chance of being filled when the minimum wage comes into effect. However, the Government is ensuring that as and from next April, which is when the minimum wage will come into effect, one-third of the modest income of those entitled to take up these low paid jobs will be taxed and this at a time when a family on £100,000 per year will gain £77 per week. The person taking up a low paid job with a minimum wage of £170 per week will pay tax on £60 of that money. This is the type of Government and budget we have. This is the thinking which underlines its tax approach. This proves the point that the budget is economically mad as well as socially unjust.</P>
      <P>My principal criticism of the budget is that it fails to deal with the biggest blight in our society &ndash; poverty. The statistics are available, even though some of the figures may be a year or two out of date. A recent UCD study stated that one-third of children live in poverty. We should reflect on the huge amounts of money available and what might be done about that stark statistic. Other figures suggest we have the second highest rate of child poverty in the European Union. What is being done about this? The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, will proudly declare that he will give the children of Ireland an average of 60p a week extra next year from the billions of pounds surplus available to the Exchequer. In light of these facts, I cannot accept the Government is genuine in confronting poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have criticised the farm assist programme <Col N="350" /> introduced last year. The statistics indicate that the entire income for 37,000 rural families totals less than £150 per week and nothing is being done for these farmers. A farmer whose wife works on the land will be penalised because she will be considered to be a stay at home wife. The Government has no policy to alleviate rural poverty or encourage social inclusion in rural Ireland. The system has been tinkered with. There are swings and roundabouts and marginal gains in relation to poverty, but there is no real advance.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to a group which is very close to my heart &ndash; the carers. These people devote all their time and effort to looking after others and are saving the Exchequer tens of millions of pounds because the State does not have to pay for expensive residential care. At present there are more than 100,000 people who need full-time care and attention. Some 90% of these people are not in hospitals, geriatric homes or residential homes; they are looked after by family carers. Yet there is a cruel, penny-pinching approach to these people. Most of these carers are denied any type of financial support. We apply what is more of a mean test than a means test by way of trying to find every technicality and loophole and every conceivable way of not paying them the support they need. This is economically wrong and socially unjust and unwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his press release yesterday that he has secured £400 million in the budget for social welfare increases. This creates the impression that £400 million extra will be secured for the poor next year from tax revenue. Mark Twain referred to three kinds of falsehood &ndash; lies, damn lies and statistics. He would have a view on the Minister's press release and what we will hear in a moment in relation to this alleged £400 million. This is a mirage because it does not exist for next year. The Minister is shaking his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point I wish to make. If one examines the detail, the only additional sum which will be paid out of the Exchequer next year by way of social welfare support will be £138 million maximum. If we take the savings, control measures, reduction in unemployment and so on, the figure will be much less. The Minister had the opportunity this year, if he could have persuaded his Government colleagues, to declare war on poverty as a result of the funds available to the Exchequer. I do not know if the Minister can appreciate that point. If <Col N="351" /> not, there is no point in my talking to him. Prior to the budget, I said I hoped the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs would be in a position to secure a decent amount of money this year to deal with the poverty issue. This has not happened. It is clear that the impact of the social welfare measures outlined in the budget will be marginal as far as alleviating poverty is concerned.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the comparison between the £4 a week increase for a person on disability assistance and the £77 per week extra gained by a family on £100,000 per year. Matters are even worse. The increase in child benefit will not be paid until next September. Next year, those who rely on child benefit will receive four payments which will include an increase of £8 per month. The Government believes it can only afford to pay an additional £32 per child which means that it is ignoring the problem of child poverty and the importance of child benefit payments in offsetting people's child care needs. That is a travesty. It is sad, particularly given that the Government intends to squirrel away a great deal of money in the social insurance fund. This year the value of the fund, which is running in surplus, doubled from approximately £300 million to £600 million. I estimate that it will probably increase to £1 billion next year because there will be another surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not stating that I object to prudent management of the social insurance fund.</P>
      <P>More than £600 million is also being squirreled away to pay for pensions. Neither do I object to that but it shows the amount of money that is currently available. Apart from the additional surplus which will come from the social insurance fund next year and the huge amount being invested in the pension fund, the Government will still have an enormous Exchequer surplus next year. God only knows what that surplus will be, it could amount to £2 billion. Every year it is under-estimated and every year more and more money is poured into the State's coffers.</P>
      <P>That is the broad picture of which we must take account when deciding how to confront poverty. However, the budget offers only a pittance to the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on social welfare payments and the one million children in respect of whom child benefit is paid. The Minister for Finance's proposals are of no consequence and they will not make any material difference. We had the opportunity to take action but we failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the philosophy of the Government. There was some excuse for prudence when we <Col N="352" /> did not have any money and we were obliged to scrimp and scrape to find funding for modest increases. We are now so awash with money we hardly know what to do with it but the Government has decided not to do one thing, namely, to cater for the needs of the less well off in society such as the disabled, the long-term unemployed and the poor in rural and disadvantaged urban areas. One thing is certain, these people will remain poor.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the extra money being given to people who reach the age of 100 during the year 2000. That is a nice gesture which will cost the Government very little. However, that is not the way to deal with poverty. More power to those who attain the age of 100 next year and I wish them all a happy birthday. However, this measure affects so few people that it is hardly worth mentioning in the context of an anti-poverty package.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would take on board the proposals my party made prior to the budget in respect of the need for decent increases. I wanted social welfare increases to be paid in April but I suppose half a loaf is better than no bread because they will now be paid in May. If the Government was genuinely committed to reforming the system, it surely could have done so next year. However, people must wait until the following year to have their increases brought forward to April. Why? Is it because we do not have enough money? I challenge the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to indicate why this was not done. The provision of an additional £20 million would have permitted the payment of the increases in April. The Government has taken a mean and miserable approach and stated &ldquo;We will go halfway and let them wait another year before their increase come into line with those paid to people on fat incomes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My party also suggested that there should be a decent increase in basic social welfare payments. I did not state that we should pay everyone £100 per week, I said we should aim towards doing so. I advocated beginning with pensioners who will be paid that amount within the next two years in any event. Why not increase their payments now while the money is available? Unfortunately, because of their age some of these people will not live to see the advent of the £100 per week payment.</P>
    <P>We should have aimed towards the immediate introduction of a personal rate of payment of £100 per week for pensioners and moved a reasonable way towards doing the same for other social welfare recipients. I suggested an increase of £10 per week for single people and £17 per week for couples. However, the Minister only introduced increases of £4 and £3. These amounts are derisory.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to my interest in carers. Only 13,000 to 14,000 carers receive payments from the State. A great deal has been made of the £100 increase in the respite payment. That payment only goes to the 13,000 people who qualify for the <Col N="353" /> allowance. What about the other 70,000 or 80,000 who do not receive carer's allowance or respite payments? The Government was very unwise to ignore the demands of these people. There is room for easing the means test in order that a further 10,000 people could qualify. For those who do not qualify, there is the incapacitated person's tax allowance which only 400 people are entitled to claim at present. That allowance should be extended to all those providing full-time care who do not qualify for carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance of £5 per week is important to those who are very poor. The allowance dates back to 1986 and I thought it should have been doubled this year. However, the Minister's answer has again been negative.</P>
    <P>At one point prior to the budget I suggested that a special millennium payment should be made to pensioners. My final proposal, however, was more modest and advocated increasing the Christmas bonus from 70% to 100%. Again, however, the Minister's answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is one final area relating to the area on which the Minister should have focused but which has again been ignored. I saw a report that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was to make free electricity available to everyone of the age of 75, irrespective of income or household composition. Medical care is far more important to the elderly, as is the security provided by a medical card. Pensioners consult me about various problems and the one which is always uppermost in their minds is their concern about whether they will be able to obtain medical care and whether they will be able to afford it.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the delays in our hospitals which have resulted in thousands of people, many of them elderly, hobbling about in pain while awaiting hip operations or living in danger while awaiting heart operations. This issue has not been dealt with. We should aim towards a situation where all pensioners over the age of 66 would automatically qualify for a medical card. This need not be done in one budget but it should be our ultimate goal. However, nothing has been done. If the Government had any real interest in the elderly, it would confront this issue.</P>
    <P>While I will be glad to listen to the self-congratulatory remarks I anticipate from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs about this miserable package, I hope he demanded three times the amount granted to his Department in the budget. If he did not, he should resign. If he did and was not allocated the amount he requested, perhaps others should consider resigning. That is the bottom line. The worst situation of all will be if the Minister stands up and trumpets achievements as if they were going to be an answer to the problem of poverty. The cold light of reality should begin to dawn on him and he should fully appreciate that this is not the case. He should fully appreciate that is not so. The budget generally has been a huge disappointment. It let down those who needed help and whose time had come and deserved better. I referred earlier to carers who struggle on low <Col N="354" /> incomes. One in three young people will continue to live on the margins of the Celtic tiger next year &ndash; they could be termed the &ldquo;Celtic cubs&rdquo;&ndash; and their needs, requirements and rights still do not seem to matter to those in power; they deserve better. During the American Civil War a US general earned a notorious reputation because, in Abraham Lincoln's words, &ldquo;he could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory&rdquo;. Ireland has its own such general, namely, the Minister for Finance. In time, historians will look on yesterday's budget with the awe displayed by Lincoln when he looked at that incompetent general and ask how he did it.</P>
    <P>The Minister had thousands of millions of pounds at his disposal, something about which previous Ministers for Finance could only dream. All he had to do with his colleagues was devise a plan to use that money in a way that would fairly benefit the people, yet somehow he fluffed it and, in the process, not merely did he shock every poor person, married person working at home and social welfare recipient, he horrified and disgusted them and left them to wonder what type of Ireland he was trying to create. It is one in which people on the basic minimum wage, earning less that £4.40 per hour, will have their already miserably inadequate income taxed. If one earns more than £110 per week or £22 per day, one must pay tax in the Minister's vision for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this &ldquo;Charlie in Wonderland&rdquo; vision, the poor only deserve the proverbial crumbs from his table and that is what they got. If one is poor, in a low paid job or a community employment scheme, on social welfare or relying at the end of one's days on the State's pension system, the Minister's attitude seems to be that they did not think he would give them that much money. One can call him a Scrooge-like Minister but perhaps he is more like Fagin; at least Scrooge learnt his lesson and changed his mind according to that Christmas story.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not changed his mind. He seems to think it is good in a wonderful, new Ireland that all mothers should be forced out of their homes and into the workplace. The gospel according to St. Charlie says that families with two parents working outside the home are so good that he rewards them with tax breaks while families with one parent working in the home are so bad that he hits them where it hurts &ndash; in their pockets &ndash; by making them pay more tax. Having tried to force parents who work at home into the workplace, he does not even have the decency to provide them with decent child care facilities. Again, what type of Ireland is he trying to create? He appears to have no understanding of the needs of the poor but then that was evident in his earlier incarnation as Minister for Social Welfare, but his lack of understanding about and concern for society is worse than his treatment of those in the bottom tier of society who desperately needed his help in the budget but got nothing worth talking about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> A budget is not merely about balancing the books. It should be about creating a society that all of us deserve to live in, one which measures its achievements not just by cold percentages in accountancy books or computer programmes but by people's lives. Money should have been put in the pockets of the poor, not simply because it makes economic sense but because social justice demands it. More money should have been allocated for old age pensions, not because it might win more votes or would be popular but because they deserve it as an acknowledgement of their contribution to the Ireland they helped to create. Above all, forcing mothers who work in the home into the marketplace is unacceptable, even if it makes economic sense.</P>
    <P>The issue is not about playing God with economics but providing a quality of life for families. If both parents want to work outside the home, they should be supported, for example, through the provision of proper child care facilities, because it is the right thing to do. That is another of the Minister's many missed opportunities. However, if instead of working outside the home one parent decides to provide child care in the home, that should also be supported, whatever about the economic effects, because it is also the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>That is something that could hardly be said of this millennium budget. It does nothing about creating an ideal society or moving us one miserable step down the road to creating the Ireland we deserve. Will our quality of life be enhanced by the budget? Will it help to preserve the environment? Will it promote sustainable development? Will it enable the next generation to buy homes for themselves and their families? From the minor to the major issues, the Minister missed the point completely in the budget.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister might describe himself as a republican. However, republicanism is supposed to be about equality. It is not about helping the wealthy while ignoring the needs of the poor or forcing women into the workplace when they wish to stay at home to nurture their children. If yesterday was the best Fianna Fáil, the republican party, could do to promote equality, God help our Republic.</P>

      <P>What a tangled web the Government weaves. It may have taken a few months for the public to cop on to the unfair, selfish package announced in 1997 by the Minister for Finance in his first budget, but this year is quite different. The people know already. There is an expectation that this side of the House must be critical and examine a good package to find the bad bits in order to fulfil its role in Opposition. However, in <Col N="356" /> my initial remarks I will rely on external observers who carry clout and represent important constituencies.</P>
      <P>Gráinne Healy, chairwoman of the National Women's Council of Ireland, the umbrella organisation for all women, categorised the budget in her initial response as &ldquo;Nightmare Budget for Women&rdquo;. She stated:</P>
      <P>The National Women's Council of Ireland is incensed at the Budget 2000 measures. Failing to address women's poverty, the childcare needs of all parents and simultaneously pushing women out to the workforce with no choices concerning the caring responsibilities, presents a clear statement on the Government's position with regard to equality for women.</P>
      <P>The failure of the Government to deliver any support to parents to pay for childcare is utterly disgraceful. The Minister is clearly saying to parents pay for your own childcare, the state has no responsibility to you or your children. The Minister is giving his tacit approval for forcing women to make precarious, unsuitable childcare arrangements because they cannot afford quality childcare.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed stated that &ldquo;the biggest giveaway budget has widened the gap between rich and poor. They state that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will be remembered for a budget that increased social exclusion and assert that he spent most of his money on making the rich richer. This is the judgment of those reflective organisations which represent the unemployed and women.</P>
      <P>One rarely receives instant reaction from constituents to a Budget Statement, but I received a fax yesterday before 7 o' clock. It is signed by one of my constituents and I can quote it because it is an open letter to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It states:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. McCreevy,</P>
      <P>I am disgusted at the lack of vision in your budget and your decision to discriminate against me, my wife and son and future children should we decide to concentrate on the most important thing we will do, raise the next generation.</P>
      <P>The final paragraph states:</P>
      <P>My family used to vote for Fianna Fáil but I doubt if I will ever do so again after seeing the introduction of this anti-family budget. If there is any court action to attack this anti-family, anti-woman, anti-future budget, I will support it.</P>
      <P>This is from a Fianna Fáil supporter in my constituency. In the context of having untold billions at this disposal, so much money that he had to create new edifices in which to hide it, it is mind numbing that the Minister could produce a document that is so socially divisive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politics can be a funny business. A few weeks <Col N="357" /> ago, I participated in a &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme with the Minister for Finance during which he belittled a ministerial colleague who in the previous week advocated a more liberal position than his on asylum seekers and immigration policy. Yesterday he presented us with an assault on the position of the non-working spouse and the family, ostensibly to provide workers for the Celtic tiger economy. It appears the Government believes that forcing mothers out of the family home is preferable to dealing with the multi-cultural society that the acceptance of economic immigration would bring about. I wonder what Deputy Callely would say in explaining to non-working spouses the cost to them of our failure to allow people in this country to take up work or perhaps he is side-tracked at present dealing with the taxi drivers whom he has led up a similar garden path in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is multi-culturalism that Fianna Fáil, the party of the idyllic and homogenous Ireland, is worried about. In response to a parliamentary question yesterday, I received a breakdown of work permits granted in Ireland to various nationalities. Surprisingly, the bulk of them came from anglophone and former British Commonwealth countries. Last year almost a quarter of all work permits issued went to citizens of the United States. It appears that is the only type of cultural exchange the Government can handle.</P>
    <P>My party's spokesperson on finance stated on radio this morning that the Labour Party believes married couples should have a choice in terms of whether one member remains at home to look after children. It is a matter of basic rights and fundamental choice, and choice is a two way street. It includes facilitating people who wish to stay at home as much as providing services to those who choose to go out to work. Many couples believe it is preferable for a parent to stay at home with children particularly during the formative years. This is a choice individual couples make. It is appalling, therefore, that the Minister for Finance's tax system will be restructured in a way which imposes a financial penalty on couples who decide that one parent should remain at home to mind children during those important years. The parents of a handicapped child who decide that one of them should give up work to care full-time for their child will be particularly disadvantaged. This is outrageous and unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They can now apply for the carer's benefit. Has the Deputy forgotten about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the current carer's allowance is means tested. We will wait and see what is promised regarding the promised carer's benefit. However, as it stands, such parents will be fundamentally discriminated against. No safety net has been promised in the Minister's appalling divisive proposals for the bulk of par<Col N="358" /> ents who decide to stay at home because their children need them in their formative years.</P>
      <P>This is not just about women and the options given to them by society. It is also about modern couples and facilitating choices they might wish to make. In an increasing number of instances, this may involve the man choosing to stay at home. It is a growing phenomenon in developed countries. Neither I nor the Labour Party wishes to be part of a crusade to keep women in the home. The workplace and the home have benefited from increased female participation in the labour force.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that as many women today will opt as their mothers may have done for a life of full-time care in the home. That is the natural pattern of events, but the Labour Party will not be party to a crusade to force women out of the home to suit the dictates of an economy that has other sources of labour available to it. Few people would have expected that type of proposal from a Government which involves Fianna Fáil, which has trumpeted itself from its foundation as a pro-family party which allows women and men to choose to stay at home and support developing children.</P>
      <P>If that question is relevant to Fianna Fáil, it is particularly relevant for Deputies Fox, Blaney, Gildea and Healy-Rae. In the past all of them have paid lip service to their crusade in support of the traditional vision of family life and social issues. I might normally agree with that vision. Voting against the Partnership for Peace proposals in the House may have been easy for them when they knew that their lack of support for the Government did not jeopardise the success of the motion. However, this issue is a real test for them. I formally challenge Deputies Fox, Blaney and Healy-Rae in particular who have talked about family values for a long time.</P>
      <P>It is beyond belief, beyond imagining, that they could possibly support these proposals.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy has sought to defend his budget as radical. It is certainly that. Deputy Noonan, in his immediate response to the budget yesterday, said Pol Pot was radical. That is correct. One economic commentator referred to the budget as Thatcherite. In her own way, Baroness Thatcher was radical. In fairness to Deputy McCreevy, and in fairness to Margaret Thatcher as well, both deserve comparison, but to each other rather than to Pol Pot. Both are radical reactionaries. Both are economic zealots. It is funny how leopards do not change their spots, how people return to form. As Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, produced the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; and earned himself a certain degree of infamy. As Minister for Finance, who produced a divisive pro-rich budget, he had, we thought, changed his spots last year. However, he has returned remarkably to form in the proposals he laid before the House yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday's budget bore all the hallmarks of a man on a mission who has locked himself into the control room. In doing so he has set himself and <Col N="359" /> his colleagues, including a hapless Taoiseach now contemplating the ghosts of budgets past, on a collision course with an electorate who, despite the revelations from tribunals in recent years, could scarcely have thought such callousness existed within their Government. Even Charlie Haughey would not have stood over this budget.</P>
    <P>Are we to have no representative of the Government here? This budget will be perceived as being ideologically formed and socially divisive. Nowhere is the ideological stamp of Deputy McCreevy and his closest Cabinet ally, the Tánaiste Deputy Mary Harney, more obvious than in regard to the decision to reduce the upper tax rate by 2%. This is a move which is of no benefit to lower earners and which will benefit those who already have most. It is a change for which there was virtually no demand. The trade unions did not seek it. IBEC made it clear that it was not one of their priorities. Many economists warned against it. There was a consensus that the correct road to take was to increase tax credits and widen tax bands. Everybody, even the well paid, would benefit from that course of action. People would benefit equally. There would not be a disproportionate benefit for those who are already wealthy. As recently as September when the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party met in Galway, the Taoiseach said that the tax issue was not about rates but the level at which people started paying the upper rate. That is a view the Taoiseach expressed, and we would have expected that that is where his heart lay. Obviously there has been a change of mind since then. That, or the Taoiseach has been put in his place. He sat very uncomfortably yesterday in this Chamber, with the Minister for Finance on one side and the Tánaiste on the other. He is the first Taoiseach to be surrounded by Progressive Democrats. That was their view. They obviously decided the economic strategy while the Taoiseach was doing fine work for this country in Northern Ireland. He was devoting his energies to Northern Ireland, but the Tánaiste and her close ally, the Minister for Finance, were running the economy here to the benefit of the wealthy. The tax package is among the most deeply unjust put in place by any Government, and I will return to it later.</P>
    <P>On social welfare &ndash; and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is here to hear this &ndash;  Deputy McCreevy has surpassed himself. The £4 rise in the basic payment is in stark contrast to the size of the tax give-away to the wealthy. This is juxtapositioned with the fabulous tax breaks proposed for wealthy people. In some respects it is surprising, but why should we be surprised? The Minister's handling of social welfare in the past would not have lead us to be very optimistic. There are people whom both the Minister and Margaret Thatcher view with contempt. They are the powerless people who are dependent on social welfare benefits for their mere survival. They are to have no part in the Celtic tiger. Thankfully, old age pensioners have <Col N="360" /> been treated somewhat better, and have been spared the bottom rung in this new order that is being established.</P>
    <P>Children too, in the Minister's world, are little more than a drag on our successful, bullish economy. In the Minister's world they are not to be cherished and supported but rather to be resented. The £46 million pounds announced yesterday for child care is pitifully inadequate. The increases in child benefit are considerably smaller in percentage terms than those given by the previous Government. In real terms, despite the enormously different financial circumstances, the wads of money available to this Administration, they are greater by a miserable £2.50. To put it in context, this increase would not pay for an extra pint of milk a day. That is how this Government wants to support families and children. Both the child care package and the £35 million announced for people with learning disabilities represent a smaller cost to the Exchequer than the cost of the reductions announced yesterday in Capital Acquisitions Tax. The give-away in Capital Acquisitions Tax is greater than the amount of money available for child care and for children with learning disabilities. There is a sense of skewed priorities. There appears to be no further money to tackle the enormous health waiting lists, compounded by the difficulties the health services have endured in recent weeks and the first national strike by nurses. No move was announced in the budget on early childhood education. These are issues that will be revisited by Labour Party speakers later in this debate.</P>
    <P>When one looks at how this Government is treating children and parents, it is not surprising that the Minister is so obsessed with future pension provision. By the time he is finished slashing the size of the next generation, there will be nobody left to pay the pensions which will be due to be paid in 30 or 40 years' time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments made here yesterday by my colleague, Deputy McDowell, about the Minister's pension plan. They represent the most serious critique of the plan I have heard thus far. Yesterday's budget was stuffed with measures to hide money, volumes of cash. However, there is nothing more spectacular than the pension plan to meet a demographic need the OECD has suggested hardly exists. It is a classic Department of Finance ploy. It does not want to sort out people in genuine need now. This Government has obviously decided this is the tack to take. Rather, it is will create an enormous fund to look after the needs of this country in 20 or 30 years' time.</P>

      <P>If Fianna Fáil votes for this budget the party will have abandoned whatever flimsy pretension they had to be the party of the family and of ordinary people. The budget and its accompanying stability programme are the most right-wing and regressive documents we have seen in this State since the current Attorney General returned to his legal practice a few years ago.</P>
      <P>I conclude by focusing on two points made by the Minister for Finance. He said that budgets should be judged in two ways: first, against the economic circumstances in which they are set and second, on the basis of the economic strategy they set out. What can be said about the economic circumstances in which the budget is set? Awash with money, the economy was never better placed for a socially just budget. The Minister has no comprehension of the opportunities he has missed to make real this republic to which his party and its supporters have paid pious lip service. With regard to his second criterion, I am deeply concerned that the path the Minister has set out is both divisive and dangerous. I and the Labour Party are committed, to the best of our ability, to fighting this divisiveness, regression and conservatism every step of the way.</P>

      <P>It is one of the extraordinary paradoxes of Irish politics that we have a penchant for replicating other people's mistakes just after they have corrected them themselves. In the week Minister McCreevy gave a budget which had £941 billion for disposal, the great model of the Progressive Democrats, the New Zealand Government of Prime Minister Shipley was being driven from office. It is interesting to consider the circumstances in which that happened. Those who replaced that Government had an election manifesto which promised a rise in tax.</P>

      <P>When I visited New Zealand I found no one who was willing to defend the appalling social travesty that had been visited on the country during the period of extreme neo-liberal market thinking. I listened for years to Deputy Harney telling us how we must become like New Zealand, with all its misery with regard to what had happened to pensions. When I was asked about the New Zealand Government on radio and television in that country, I said I remembered a country which had the first social credit, gave a lead in the world in relation to social housing and had a wonderful attitude to welfare, and then I remembered the aberration that was visited on it by the neo-liberal right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though that government is driven from office by a party promising a rise in tax, the same <Col N="362" /> thinking defines the budget we listened to yesterday. When I read <i>The Irish Times </i>this morning and saw an editorial about an historic moment in Irish history I thought they could not be writing about Deputy McCreevy's budget already. Of course it was historic. The Minister with the largest amount to spend decided to give enhanced benefits to those who already had a great deal &ndash; I will deal with this in detail when we discuss the Finance Bill. In relation to tax, for example, those on the upper rate got the same percentage reduction as those on the standard rate. They are not the same set of beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney has been able to force an ideological position on the Government. It is the politics of anti-tax. No one seems to question her assumption that by reducing tax at all levels one creates a productive economy. Right through the entire budget this philosophy shows up in different ways. I have a file that would be too heavy to carry of pre-budget submissions made by people who expected that, at last there was an opportunity to do something. For example, the Childcare 2000 campaign put forward a proposal, which would be taxed, pitched at £20 and £10 depending on the age of children. We supported that proposal. Instead of that the Government has brought in a concept of child parking. It gives to the Irish business sector the same kind of allowances for child parking as it gives for car parking and with the same miserable thinking.</P>
    <P>If those who watch and listen to politics being debated want to know the difference between parties or to reject the suggestion that they are all the same, they should examine this budget closely. IBEC has got everything it wanted. It is now accepted that the version of the economy that the Minister for Finance stands for is one in which the people serve the machine that is the economy rather than the economy producing benefit which might serve the economy and make it more civilised, more sustainable, more equal and more inclusive.</P>
    <P>Minister McCreevy has the gall to suggest that we have become more European now. He has felt that for a long time, he tells us. He goes on to suggest how our society has been transformed. Has it? If he is feeling European, why has he not got a European model of child care, of education, or of spending on health and housing or any of these things? He is suggesting that it is natural to get up in the dark and drive to work, drive home in the dark, park your children and that the State will give 100% tax relief to your employers so that they can socialise all the costs of production and pay 12.5% corporation profits tax. It is a glorious time to be in business, paying nothing while the State pays all that is needed to provide you with a labour supply. Meanwhile the people are driven from the home into the workplace, leaving in the dark, going home in the dark while the business sector gets 100% concession for providing child parking facilities. It is a disgrace. It is the total subjugation of society to the demands of a neo-liberal version of the economy that is <Col N="363" /> bankrupt and that has been rejected in Britain under Baroness Thatcher and in New Zealand. It represents the anti-human, anti-caring philosophy of a small group of people who are peddling the politics of greed, the Progressive Democrats. They have got their way. A couple of them could swing the great Republican Party. Do I not remember Fianna Fáil Deputies during referendums on the right to control one's fertility or the right to marry again or whatever, up on their hind legs spouting about how they were for the family and for shamrocks, leprechauns and everything that was ancient and good and green and traditional? Their version of the traditional is very interesting now. Is it not very porous? Minister McCreevy has come to the conclusion that the Europeanisation of Ireland requires that there be a differential between people who are in one income families and those who are not.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting and sad to think of all the lobbying organisations. I hope they all arrive on the doorstep of the Government. We were in Government and heard cases in relation to the provision of child care. The view of my party and my own view is that any care in this regard should be based on the rights of the child but that is not IBEC's view. It was IBEC's budget we got yesterday. I hope the brothers and sisters, and congress when negotiating a new agreement, will be able to look them in the eye and say to this unique group of people, is it not wonderful, you can socialise all the costs of production, privatise the profits and reduce corporation profits tax at the same time as £4 per week is given to non-pensioners on social welfare. The Government set off an alleluia on the country for giving £7 to pensioners and told those on the dependent allowance they must wait three years to obtain 70% of the main benefit. While the tax changes amount to £942 million, the Minister still cannot pay the £17 million outstanding to those who were not aware of the benefits to which they were entitled. It is an extraordinary moment that at this unique time when there is a surplus it was decided to transfer the benefits to the propertied rather than the unpropertied, to those at the top income level &ndash; and sometimes undeclared  &ndash; rather than those on low income; that it would be used to establish and deepen a concept of the economy that was narrow and that took precedence over the society.</P>
    <P>All the figures are available to show how many old people there are in Ireland, the number of children and the number dependent on social welfare. Why not express a vision in which one would say that because the economy is doing well we should no longer have deprivation that will reproduce the cycle of poverty, long waiting lists for health care and people desperately in need of housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevey, who is philosophical about Europe suggests we are becoming European without knowing it. He says many people are choosing to go to work. What <Col N="364" /> he does not say is that many in the past five years are forced to go to work because they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads unless they have two incomes. Frequently, two incomes is insufficient.</P>
    <P>What is the response in regard to housing? The sum of £718 million provided will not adequately address the housing issue. Those reluctant speculators who would not give up their land for roads but have now taken a wham in relation to building land can have their tax reduced from 40% to 20%. It is cheering all around in the grand old support group of Fianna Fáil, the builders, the speculators, IBEC and the PD fringe. They are the people who gained in the budget. It is an outrage. The Government say people will wander around the place saying: &ldquo;Is this not the best budget we ever had?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the changes in inheritance, I agree with the Minister in relation to capital acquisitions tax on the family home. For those who want to leave a home to their children, it is only right that they would be able to enjoy the relief the Minister has mentioned. In regard to residency the Minister has created a wonderful situation and has lifted the tax liability from gifts &ndash; if the person is living outside the State and transferring property outside of the State he or she can do so for free. Places such as Castlemartin will be cheering for that too. One will be able to divide up all the wealth in the modern speculative economy and hand it to all the children and the relations and avoid tax, but some will have avoided their own taxes because they are not resident here.</P>
    <P>It is time to start speaking plainly. There are a few sentences in the Minister's speech about the Department of Finance going philosophical when he said: &ldquo;Our broad budgetary objectives are similar to previous years&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I hope I use it well. He said also: &ldquo;Rapid economic growth has transformed our society&rdquo;. It has indeed. The entire resources of our first huge surplus have been used to create further wedges of division between a new category: non-pensioner social welfare recipients and pensioners, social welfare and the low paid, those on low pay and those on middle incomes, those on middle incomes and on the top rate of tax, the propertied and the non-propertied, those with something to hand on and those with nothing to hand on, and those who have to get up in the dark and go home in the dark who want to look after their children.</P>
      <P>He missed all the agenda but he did not forget those interests that will always line up between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, those who will want a reduction from 40% to 20%, those who want to pay hardly any corporation tax while they socialise their costs. That is what this budget is about and it is a disgrace and a scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had to listen to a number of speeches. I categorically reject the political hype and bluster of the Opposition, particularly by Deputy Howlin who referred to the demographic situation. I challenge him to read the actuarial reviews which show that this country, like any other country in western Europe and elsewhere, will suffer from the demographic trend, for which we now have to plan. The Deputy may look at it only in the short-term but the Government looked at it in the long-term and made a strategic decision in relation to funding of pensions into the future, as Governments, mainly Fianna Fáil, in the 1950s and 1960s made a strategic decision to put money into education, of which we are now reaping the benefits. The decision on the funding of pensions is also a strategic one from which there will be benefits in the future.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Howlin, referred to the various lobby groups that have been jumping up and down as they always do. I am pleased that one particular group is not jumping up and down yet. It made a gross mistake last year in that it misread the figures, and I had to correct it. That group is being a little more circumspect this year. Those outside the House and all the lobby groups, which Deputy Higgins is trying to rally around, should read properly what is involved because at the end of the day, between social welfare and tax, there is a give back to the people, in the region of £1.5 billion. Even one of the commentators this morning, who is vehemently opposed to the budget, had to acknowledge there is something in it for everyone. We must have got the balance reasonably right in that the employers, as mentioned by Deputy Michael Higgins, and the unions, particularly the ICTU, so far have been complimentary in relation to the budget. Perhaps Deputy Higgins's ranting and raving will make them think twice that they are not going the way they normally go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget must be viewed as central to a comprehensive framework of policies which the Government is putting in place. These include the review of the programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the national development plan and more important than any of the others, apart from the Good Friday Agreement, a successor agreement to Partnership 2000. The budget is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to improving standards for all sectors of society. The NESC report looked at <Col N="366" /> a number of issues, including economic inclusion based on full employment, social inclusion and successful and continuing adaptation to change, which is the hallmark of the budget. This vision is shared by all the social partners and I thank them for their reasoned response to the budget. We now face a daunting task in making it a reality and its realisation crucially depends on Ireland maintaining its competitiveness.</P>
    <P>We must be ready to meet the challenges of a globalised economy where competition for foreign direct investment becomes ever stronger, especially from countries in eastern Europe. We must manage this change. The information society will affect the way we work and live. We need to position ourselves strategically for this new world. To do so we must also deal with the problems which accompany rapid economic growth. The budget acknowledges and responds to that. Above all, we must realise the full potential of all our people. Social exclusion, with its ever present companions of poverty and poor educational achievement, alienation and crime is a major constraint we must overcome if we are to realise our full potential as a people.</P>
    <P>The budget introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will meet these challenges. It will provide radical tax reform and improve living standards for all. It also invests in social services in a big way. It will maintain a strong and stable macroeconomic position, address skill shortages and make a start to addressing the issue of child care. It will also contribute to the realisation of a socially inclusive and successful society while supporting sustained competitiveness in a globalised economy.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for a prudent and stable medium and long-term fiscal framework. Our primary macroeconomic objective must remain sustainable economic and employment growth supported by low inflation, wage moderation and prudent budgetary policies. The budget, combined with the national development plan and other Government policies, will help to ensure continued strong economic growth, with growth in GNP expected to average 5.75% over the next three years. In addition, unemployment is expected to fall to approximately 4.5% of the labour force by 2002. The plan and the budget will provide an important step for the delivery of a new Ireland. Capital spending increased by 26% this year over last while capital spending on public and social housing has increased by 160% since 1996.</P>
    <P>The personal tax package announced by the Minister amounts to £950 million, the biggest tax package ever in the history of the State. It takes 125,000 taxpayers out of the top rate of income tax and takes 50,000 out of the tax net altogether, including 10,000 people aged 65 years and over. We all aspire to removing as many people as possible from paying the top rate of tax. The strategy of this and the next two budgets will address that.</P>

    <P>Turning to the social welfare aspects of the budget, since I took up office I have aimed to secure the future of our older people, improve the living standards of everybody on social welfare, support people with disabilities and carers and support families and communities. The social welfare package will amount to approximately £398 million, together with an additional allocation of £5 million to my Department for child care provision and a further £15 million for the pension provisions in the forthcoming Social Wel<Col N="368" /> fare Bill. This amounts to a total investment in a full year of more than £418 million, by far the biggest social welfare package in the history of the State. In my term as Minster, in each of the three budgets to which I have had an input, I have been able to say that the social welfare package is the biggest in the history of the State. I say that with pride. A sum of £316 million was provided in 1999 and £225 million in 1998. In the last budget of the previous Government, in 1997, a sum of £215 million was provided in a full year. Only three years later the allocation to social welfare has effectively doubled.</P>

      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium we promised that old age (contributory) pensions would reach £100 per week by 2002. Over the first two budgets we went further than required to meet that. We also made new commitments in the review of the programme for Government and I am delighted to continue to meet these. We are increasing all pensions to older people by £7 per week bringing the old age (contributory) pension and retirement pension to £96 per week. We are on target to more than exceed our commitment to a rate of £100 in next year's budget.</P>
      <P>The rate of payment to widows' (contributory) pension for those aged 66 years and over increases to £89.10 per week with the old age (non-contributory) pension increasing to £85.50 per week. Both are in line to reach £100 by 2002, a new commitment set out in our review of the programme for Government. These increases of 7.9% and 8.9% are three to four times the underlying rate of inflation and are well ahead of the expected rise in average industrial earnings. When the Opposition was in Government it gave a rise of 2.5% to old age pensioners in its first budget when inflation was at the same rate. It effectively amounted to no real increase.</P>

Non-contributory pensioners will get an even bigger increase per week of £14.50.</P>

      <P>On capital assessment, I am pleased to be in a position to respond positively to the representations which have been made by Deputies on all sides of the House, the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, and many members of my parliamentary party. The new arrangements will provide that the first £10,000 of capital will be completely disregarded for a single person. For a couple, this figure will obviously be £20,000. In effect, a huge number of people will be affected positively by this. I give details in the script of the tapering in that respect. This will cost £5 million in a full year. A survey of pensioners found that 88% had capital of less than £10,000. These new arrangements will apply to all means tested payments with the exception of UA and SWA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> Last year in my budget speech, I announced that my Department would carry out a review of the qualifying conditions for the retirement and old age contributory pensions. I am pleased to be able to report that the first phase of this review is almost completed and during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill I hope to be in a position to outline the proposals of this review. The review is also looking closely at the operation of the current yearly average test, which has caused problems over the years, and the implications of moving to a &ldquo;total contributions&rdquo; approach. The current structure of the contributory rates bands is also being examined and, in this regard, I plan to bring forward some rationalisation proposals in the Social Welfare Bill which will benefit an estimated 38,000 pensioners.</P>
    <P>Regarding contributions paid prior to 1953, as Deputies will be aware such contributions are already taken into account in assessing title to retirement and old age contributory pensions to the extent that they can be used to satisfy the &ldquo;total number of contributions paid&rdquo; requirement. However, certain people with pre-1953 insurance have failed to qualify for pensions because their contributions are not fully taken into account under the existing &ldquo;yearly average&rdquo; test. My Department has examined ways in which further recognition can be given to pre-1953 contributions and I will bring forward proposals in this respect to an estimated value of £15 million. This will cure many problems experienced by people who had work records prior to 1953.</P>
    <P>I will also be bringing forward a comprehensive occupational pensions Bill as early as possible next year in order to make the issue of personal occupations pensions much more widespread. One of the main recommendations of the NPPI report will be the introduction of a PRSA and that will be taken care of in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One other issue which I raised last year in my budget speech and also with my officials and the Pensions Board was the integration of social welfare pensions, about which Members on all sides of the House are worried. This is an issue on which I made some changes in last year's Social Welfare Bill and I propose to make another amendment in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill to continue this process.</P>
    <P>My second key objective is to improve the living standards of everybody on social welfare. We hear a great deal about the booming economy, but we must ensure that we have a booming society where everybody benefits from social and economic growth. Employment certainly is the key to the booming economy and a decent job is the best route out of poverty. The live register has fallen by over 80,000 or one-third since we took up office. Some 200,000 jobs have been created since we came into office.</P>
    <P>With regard to the live register, I am trying to make more people employable. The proportion of money spent in active policies to help people get back to work and education reached the 20% target I set last year. In this coming year, over <Col N="371" /> one-quarter of all social welfare spending on employment and unemployment will go on active measures to help people in this respect. I am announcing a further increase of 5,000 places in the back to work scheme, bringing the number of places available under the scheme to 34,000.</P>
    <P>Two other aspects of the welfare system which caused great disincentives to employment are still in evidence and I have looked at these. The first relates to the tapering of rent and mortgage interest supplements. Under the current system, people can retain secondary benefits subject to two key limitations &ndash; their gross weekly household income must not exceed £250 and the maximum rent supplement they can receive is £250 per month. The latter has become a particular problem with rising rent levels in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am introducing a number of key changes to the arrangements for retaining rent and mortgage supplements on taking up work under these schemes. The weekly limit will now be calculated net of any back to work allowance payments and family income supplement payments. This will ensure that families with children will be better positioned to qualify for retention of the supplement.</P>
    <P>Second, I am abolishing the £250 &ldquo;cheque limit&rdquo; on retaining rent and mortgage interest supplements in favour of a tapered withdrawal of this payment over a four year period. These payments will be paid at the rate of 75% of the previous entitlement in the first year and at a rate of 50%, 25% and 25% again in the second, third and fourth years. This will ensure that families with children who are facing high rental costs will see a substantial improvement in their household income, particularly in the critical first years of the transition from unemployment into employment. Some 2,750 people and their families are expected to be supported by this initiative.</P>
    <P>I am also taking steps to improve the treatment of people on rent supplement who take up part-time or casual work. From April, a £25 income disregard will be introduced to ensure that there is a positive return from work for those who avail of part-time work opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am also providing for a disregard of additional income arising from participation in training courses, such as FÁS skills training courses, for people in receipt of rent supplement. Some 2,500 people are expected to benefit from this measure which will come into effect in April next.</P>
    <P>The problem regarding the tapered qualified adult allowance has been around for many years. My predecessor made some changes regarding the tapering arrangements and I continued that over the past number of years. I recently met a delegation of women employed in the contract cleaning industry and their SIPTU representatives who brought home to me again the difficulties in the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>The measures I am introducing in this budget will improve the position by addressing all the <Col N="372" /> elements which contribute to the disincentive impacts of the current scheme. First, the income disregard applied to the spouse's earnings from employment is being increased from £45 to £60 and this will include any travel costs incurred in going to and from work. That is something which the delegation to which I referred ask me to do. Second, the income range to which the current tapering arrangements apply is set at £60 to £105. I am adjusting this income range so that the lower bound is set at £70 and the upper bound is set at £135. Third, again this is something which will be welcomed, I am improving the withdrawal rate so that where income of the spouse is between £70 and £90, the qualified adult allowance is reduced by £2.50 for each additional £5 of earnings and where the spouse's earnings are between £90 and £135, the QAA will be withdrawn at a rate of £3.50 for each additional £5. At present, the allowance is withdrawn at a rate of £4.50 for every additional £5 earned.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the rate of child dependant allowance is currently halved once the income of the claimant's spouse exceeds £60. I am providing in this budget that this measure will not come into effect until the earnings of the spouse exceed the upper bound of the revised income range, that is, £135.</P>
    <P>These measures will be introduced with effect from April 2000 in tandem with the introduction of the national minimum wage. The combined effect of all of these measures will be very significant. A family with two children, where the spouse has earnings of £90 per week, for instance, will be better off by some £35 from April of next year by comparison with the current system.</P>
    <P>I am also providing in the budget for the extension of the tapered qualified adult allowance to invalidity pensioners from April 2000, and to retirement pensioners and old age contributory pensioners from October 2000. I expect that 3,000 families will gain from the introduction of these measures.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement threshold has been increased by £13 at each point. This will provide weekly increases of some £8 for all recipients of this payment.</P>

      <P>The £4 increase in general social welfare rates represents an increase of between 5.2% and 5.6%, which is more than double the underlying rate of inflation and in line with the expected increases in average industrial earnings. It is something the Deputy and others have called for over the last two years, and nothing their parties have done in Government compares to it. Following these increases, all social welfare payments will be at least £2.90 a week above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the qualified adult allowance and I will be moving over the next three years &ndash; as most of the lobby groups have requested &ndash; to increase the QAA to 70% of the main rate. This budget starts to deliver on this commitment with a minimum increase of £3.80 in the general QAA rate. Other QAA rates. especially those which are below 60% of the relevant personal rates, will receive higher increases. The combination of personal and QAA increases means that couples will receive a weekly increase of £7.80 &ndash; an increase of almost 7%.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to a decision which has been taken at EU level in respect of the butter voucher scheme. Deputies will be aware that people getting long-term means tested payments have been able to purchase butter at subsidised rates for some time. This benefit was provided under an EU scheme within the Common Agriculture Policy. I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, that the EU Agricultural Council has decided, on foot of a proposal from the EU Commission, to end the EU butter scheme at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>They are actually. That is the reality. Deputies on all sides of the House are keenly aware of the valuable work undertaken by carers in our society. The number of carers in receipt of carer's allowance is up by over 50%, from 9,200 when we took office, to 13,850 at the end of October this year. We need to do more, however</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I extended a number of free schemes to carers and I am continuing this process in the current budget by extending the free electricity and free television allowances to this group, regardless of their household composition. In other words, anyone on a carer's allowance will be entitled to all the free schemes. That has been achieved in two years. Last year, I also introduced a new respite care grant of £200 for anyone on a carer's allowance, which was much lauded. This has now been increased by £100 to £300. I am also giving the benefit of the back to education allowance under certain conditions to allow carers, who have finished their caring, to qualify for the scheme.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has announced that the domiciliary care allowance scheme will be extended to children under two years of age from 1 January 2000. Because of this I have agreed to extend the carer's allowance to carers of this group, at an additional cost of £1 million.</P>
      <P>Many of us are very familiar with the difficulties and stresses experienced by those who are working and caring full time. Deputy Howlin, who has now left the Chamber, was interested to hear the details of the carer's benefit. It is a pity he did not wait to hear the details, but perhaps he did not want to hear any more good news.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Deputy's proposal but he did nothing about it. This Government is a government of action. The Deputy's party might propose it, but we do it. Following the review of the carer's allowance, which recommended the development of a carer's benefit, I established an interdepartmental group to examine the issues. I have decided to introduce a radical and innovative benefit scheme to enable carers to give up work temporarily to care full-time while still retaining their employment rights. This new scheme, called the carer's benefit, will involve two central elements, both of which are regarded <Col N="375" /> as essential to the recipient. The first of these is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. Unlike the carer's allowance, this will be social insurance benefit and will, therefore, not be means tested. It will be paid provided the relevant PRSI contribution conditions have been met. The second entitlement is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. This will require the introduction of legislation by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
      <P>I will outline briefly the social welfare details of this new scheme. The benefit will be based on a person's PRSI contributions and the maximum claim duration will be set at 12 months. This time period should be sufficient to facilitate carers who have to leave the workforce temporarily to care for an elderly or infirm person or to make long-term arrangements. In addition, it will allow for the protection of the carer's employment rights, which is a key feature of the scheme. In the event of the carer's benefit expiring, the carer will be able to apply for the carer's allowance. Although it will not be means tested, the new scheme will be closely linked to the means tested carer's allowance in relation to other conditions. The same medical criteria, full-time care requirements, residency and part-time working conditions will apply. All PRSI contribution classes will be included for the purpose of the carer's benefit scheme, except for the self-employed, class S, and those earning less than £30, class J.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be available to employees who have at least three years contributions and who are employed for a minimum of 19 hours per week prior to commencing full-time caring duties. In addition, the PRSI qualifying conditions will be as flexible as possible to ensure that workers with atypical work patterns or an irregular work history will be in a position to qualify for this scheme. The weekly rate of payment will be £88.50 and additional increases for child dependants will be payable where appropriate. I am pleased to inform the House that this scheme will be fully funded from the social insurance fund and will not give rise to an increase in the PRSI contribution rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that when the scheme reaches maturity there could be in the region of 6,600 claimants for this benefit. This new scheme will become operational from October 2000, following the introduction of the necessary legislation by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. The measures I have outlined are clearly indicative of the Government's support for carers. We recognise the value of carers in our society. We support them and we care about them. We know that by helping carers, we are also helping the people for whom they care. We recognise that carers have their own special social, economic and health needs. This Government's objective is to support those diverse needs and to ensure that carers <Col N="376" /> maintain their individual rights. The measures I have introduced today are an affirmation of the value we place on carers in our society.</P>
    <P>From May next year and as part of the process of progressively extending payment of the disability allowance to people in residential care, I am providing that full-rate disability allowance will be payable to those who are currently in residential care and who are currently in receipt of half-rate payments. This measure will extend full-rate payments to 370 people at a full year cost of £700,000.</P>
    <P>We have made substantial progress in recent years in developing supports available to people with disabilities to encourage them to become more self-reliant. One of the measures introduced was to extend access to the back-to-work allowance to claimants of disability allowance and blind person's pension. From April next year, I am extending access to this scheme to recipients of the invalidity pension and unemployability supplement. I am also extending access to the back-to-education allowance to these categories. Last year I increased the rehabilitative earnings disregard from £35 to £50. It is now being increased to £75 with effect from next April. Almost 900 people will benefit from this measure at a full year cost of £1.1 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently undertaking a review of the various income maintenance schemes for people who are ill and people with disabilities. Notwithstanding the improvements introduced in recent years in this area, it is widely recognised that the current system is complex and in need of rationalisation. The review will therefore examine the roles and effectiveness of the range of income maintenance payments provided by my Department and also by the health boards. It will take into account the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective tool for tackling child poverty is further underlined in the budget through a full year investment in the scheme of £105 million, representing an increase of 25% in the cost of the overall scheme. That is not an inconsiderable sum. From September 2000, child benefit rates will be increased by £8 per month in respect of the first and second children and by £10 per month in respect of the third and subsequent children. This means that a family with three children will now receive £141 per month &ndash; an increase of £26. I will comment on a number of the issues that were raised, particularly Fine Gael's muddled policy on child benefit. Fine Gael's Leader, Deputy John Bruton, promised in his Ard-Fheis speech in February that when Fine Gael got back into Government it would increase child benefit by £20 per week for children under five. Deputy Noonan announced a couple of months later that he was reiterating the commitment made by Deputy Bruton in his Ard-Fheis speech to increase child benefit&mdash;</P>

      <P>One might say that £5 is only a small amount of money, but in all it costs £35 million. I pointed out that I did not favour stopping the child benefit increase to children under five years of age, because it would mean that families at the cut off point, particularly those with children aged three, four and five, would lose substantial amounts of household income over a three year period, at the time when they probably need it most. When I pointed out the problems inherent in the Fine Gael proposal, it gave a nod in this direction in its subsequent tax document a few weeks ago, saying it would do something for children over five years, but did not specify what. Deputy O'Keeffe, with the typical muddled thinking of Fine Gael, is now saying it will give £25 to children under five years and also some new variation. I cannot remember what he said &ndash; it was probably off the top of his head.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the previous Government gave in its last budget, child benefit increases valued at £28 million. This year, we are giving £105 million, which is a very substantial increase. In 1996, the previous Government gave £2&mdash;</P>

      <P>The tax measures provide for a significant real increase in take-home pay, focused on those hitting the higher rates at relatively low income levels, as well as the costs faced by two-earner couples.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last election Fianna Fáil promised an extra £2,000 tax allowance for stay-at-home mothers, but they have not given such people extra money. My answering machine broke down this morning under pressure from the number of callers who were distraught at this direct attack on women in the home. If people choose to work they should be encouraged to do so. However, if they wish to provide full-time care for their children they should also be supported. It is absurd that the difference will be £1,300 in take home pay this year, but, as the Minister indicated, this will get worse over three years and will rise to £6,000. The Supreme Court could not view this as anything other than a direct infringement of Article 41 of the Constitution and it will be unsustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bad as this provision is, the most important element of the tax code which required change is that people start to pay tax once they earn £100 per week. The secondary problem is that people hit the top rate at £14,100 but the biggest problem is that they start paying tax at £100 per week. If we are to have a minimum wage the figure will be nearer £5 per hour, whatever about the legalities. Every shop seeks part-time and full-time staff. People cannot get staff and the minimum effective rate of pay is £5 per hour to get anyone to do anything in this country. On a 40-hour week <Col N="383" /> that totals £200. Given the largesse and the fact that we can put more than £600 million into a mythical pension fund&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the current budget surplus of £3.5 billion, I cannot understand how we can increase the basic income tax personal allowance by £10 per week to £110. This is appalling for the low paid. We have had many lectures from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs about moving people from welfare to work but this measure prevents people from moving. This disincentive is incredible because we are telling employers that they must pay workers £170 per week while telling employees that we will take that money out of their pockets. It is incredible that a budget which gave away an unprecedented £942 million has also angered the low paid and spouses working in the home in such a socially divisive way.</P>
      <P>When I listen to the rhetoric of Ministers I am reminded of the second last American presidential election. During the campaign the incumbent President, George Bush, outlined all his achievements in the Gulf War and in foreign policy. However, Bill Clinton had a simple slogan &ndash; it was not about foreign policy &ndash;&ldquo;It's the economy, stupid&rdquo;. The slogan in the next election in this country will be slightly different &ndash;&ldquo;It's the people, stupid&rdquo;. We have had many measures for the economy and IBEC's approach to the budget. However, what about the people who get up at 6.50 a.m. to commute to work, who cannot get child care&mdash;</P>

      <P>People are suffering. The stress and erosion of the quality of life for ordinary people has never been worse. It is disappointing that, not only did the Government fail to honour its pre-election promise, but it is totally regressive in abandoning stay-at-home parents.</P>
      <P>As regards the reduction in income tax rates, the very wealthy should pay a top rate of tax. To deal with this problem we have advocated a new middle rate of 35p which would mean that only the super rich pay the top rate and middle income earners pay a middle rate as their top rate. That is a more focused way of addressing the middle income problem. The budget confers the benefits to the very wealthy disproportionately by the reduction in rates. This has always been PD policy and I regret that Fianna Fáil has been sucked into going in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> Child care is a fundamental issue, not just for IBEC which has its concerns, but also for parents and potential parents. This is a budget for contraception. The Government's message is that it does not want children, it wants people at work and it wants to penalise parents. In response to the Child Care 2000 campaign last year, the Minister for Finance said that he did not have enough information and that he needed more study groups, more task forces, more working group reports and that he would deal with child care this year. Expectations were raised and there was no shortage of analysis of this issue. The Child Care 2000 campaign put forward a well-reasoned call for £543 million in investment. However, it only got £46 million &ndash; less than one tenth of what is required. There is no sign of the establishment of a child care framework or a three year plan on this issue. The budget's small print indicates that only creches with up to 20 children will get grants. However, a creche cannot operate economically unless it has at least 25 children.</P>
    <P>Tax breaks have been introduced but they are totally inappropriate. The corporate sector is not investing in child care &ndash; it is a case of people who are not liable for corporation tax converting part of their homes. I regret that a meaningful attempt has not been made to deal with child benefit for children under five who are not in the formal education system. The proposals include an £8 increase per month which would not buy the smallest carton of milk available per day. The increase is so derisory as to be worthless. There is no point in Ministers trying to confuse Fine Gael's proposals. We have proposed that child benefit be increased to £25 per week for children under five. This would address the issue but there is nothing in capitation grants.</P>
    <P>My three major concerns with the budget are that it is a kick in the teeth for the low paid, it is appallingly discriminatory against stay-at-home parents and it is almost negligent as regards the supply side of the child care issue. These issues remain unaddressed.</P>
    <P>Some of the submissions we received have been totally ignored in the budget. At 2 o'clock the Centre for Independent Living will meet the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise. Nothing has been done for them in this budget. Vantastic, which provides a client-based approach from Baldoyle to Bray for 400 disabled people and looked for £350,000 per year to develop the service, got nothing, let alone franchising the operation across the country. Much lip service has been paid to the fact that credit unions are the banks for ordinary people but nothing has been done concerning the working group report and implementing its recommendations on DIRT and disclosure. All Members have been inundated with letters about allowing donations to charities in Ireland to be allowable as a tax expense, as is the case with donations to charities overseas. The issue of VAT refunds has been ignored again, despite representations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs spoke about a budget for social inclusion which is an attack on poverty. Some of my constituents are permanently disabled, living alone in their 30s and 40s and in receipt of disability allowance of £73.50 per week. Are they expected to clap the Minister on the back for an extra £4? It will not make any meaningful difference to their quality of life. I could not live on £80 a week &ndash; why should they be expected to live on less?</P>
    <P>There are 100,000 carers in this country for whom little or nothing has been done. We asked for the means test to be changed and a disregard of £120 a week. We asked for the carer's income, regardless of the income of his or her spouse, to be taken into consideration. All these requests were ignored. A carer's benefit will be available to those paying PRSI. However, women working full-time in the home, minding their children and elderly or dependent relatives, do not pay PRSI so the carer's benefit is useless to them. I cannot understand why the Carers' Association has been so wilfully disregarded when the average cost of care in a private nursing home is £250 a week, a long-stay health board geriatric bed costs £350 a week and an acute general hospital bed £550 a week. The Minister will not give carers a lousy £75 when they are saving the Exchequer a fortune by providing care in the community and the home at the lowest possible cost.</P>
    <P>The last Government decentralised a great number of jobs to my constituency. About 400 jobs were decentralised to Johnstown Castle, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the EPA and other bodies. &ldquo;Enigmatic&rdquo; is the kindest description I can give to the provision for decentralisation in this budget. I want to see specifics about my constituency rather than a general paragraph about how decentralisation will be bigger and better than ever before, with no State bodies named.</P>
    <P>Something imaginative could have been done as regards a Christmas or millennium social welfare bonus. There was no imagination in this budget. It was an IBEC budget &ndash; written by and for IBEC. There were no political touches. Even the change in travel tax was forced on the Government by the EU. I expected a millennium bonus or an extension of the duration of free fuel or its increase to £10 per week. Imagination could have been shown in this budget. Instead we have a budget in which the Government dispensed its largesse. However, any Government would have that to dispense. It is not an achievement for the Government to return the peoples' money. That money is there because of the surplus resulting from growth in the workforce and the increase in revenue. However, there were no changes where they were most necessary for economic and social policy &ndash; for the low paid, child care and the support of parents, particularly those minding children in the home. The shortcomings in this <Col N="386" /> budget have been woefully exposed. The initial frothy spin and hype will not be sustainable until Christmas when people will realise the budget falls short of their requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember when Ed Begley, the cowboy actor, came to a small town in the west with a reputation of largesse. He stood at the top of the town and threw sweets to the children. This budget is similar and the expectation was that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would throw his largesse around the country and everyone would be happy. It is an illusion in many respects. The biggest flaw of this Government is that it is not clear about where the country is going. It is a reactive leadership which manages crises daily. Nobody is saying where we will be in five years and how we will get there. This budget projects expenditure of over £900 million. The budget contains some good measures and many people will be better off as a consequence. However, the money could have spent to better effect without creating the divisions now emerging.</P>
      <P>The film industry was provided for in the budget with an extension of section 481 for another five years. At first glance, the retention of this statutory measure is welcome. However, it ignores two fundamental points. First, a Government established think-tank recommended the relief should be increased to 100% &ndash; it will remain at 80% for the next five years. Second, the industry required an investment of at least £8 million and it received £5.3 million. The Irish film industry, which should be seen as a strategic instrument of development in which creative young people can become involved and generate economic growth, is being dissipated. It will be difficult to get people to invest in film as long as section 481 operates in its current form. They would be better investing in an apartment in Temple Bar or anywhere else rather than in film where the relief is 80% and the marginal rate continues to be reduced. Section 481 is an illusion in terms of its real benefit. The recommendation in the think-tank report that the relief should be increased to 100% was not heeded by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled at the hurt and division created by the discrimination against wives in the home. It is the right of every married couple to decide whether they go to work and put their children in crèches to be reared by someone else. I am not coming down on any side as to which is the better method &ndash; that is an ongoing debate. However, it is wrong that when the option is given to a person to either stay at home or go to work, the person who chooses to stay at home is penalised. Article 41 of the Constitution is clear on this. I do not understand why it has been presented in this fashion. Perhaps it relates to the attitude of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on people coming here to work. Perhaps it is an extension of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue's zero tolerance policy &ndash; zero allowance for wives at home. Perhaps the Government realises that it <Col N="387" /> needs to fill 70,000 jobs in the next few years and it will do so, not by giving working visas to people from abroad, but by driving wives out into the labour force by virtue of these penalties. This is a grossly discriminatory and wrong measure which will be strongly opposed in this House. Organisations, groups and individuals will rise against the Government. I do not understand why the Cabinet arrived at this decision.</P>
    <P>The remaining 1% pay increase to the public service under the partnership agreement is due on 1 April. However, this 1% is minus 44% income tax and 7% PRSI. This is an increase of 0.5% for every public servant in the country. The Minister for Finance expects that because of this lousy payment people should immediately accept any pay proposals put to them. This is a 1% payment, minus a 44% taxation rate, minus a 7% PRSI payment. In reality this amounts to a 0.5% increase. Thousands of public servants throughout the country are expected to accept this. There will be a different attitude when the detail of the budget leaks out.</P>
    <P>The budget proposals will not alleviate hospital waiting lists to any great extent. I believe politics is about people and that decisions taken by Government affect people's lives. Yet thousands of people are confined to misery, darkness and pain because the public health service is not performing as it should. People are awaiting cataract and orthopaedic operations. Many of these people cannot watch television, read their local papers or books or in many instances walk around the vicinity of their homes. They are confined to the inner sanctums of their homes and to darkness and misery during their later years. I do not understand why the Government did not give relief, hope and courage in this the year of the elderly to thousands of people. It is a case of &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo;; reach the age of 75 and you will get a free telephone allowance; reach the age of 75 and you will get free electricity and so on.</P>
    <P>On 30 June this year, 706 patients were awaiting admission for cataract operations in the Western Health Board area. There are three ophthalmologists working in the Western Health Board region. This operation takes between 20 and 30 minutes. I know consultants must perform other tasks but the operation takes 20 to 30 minutes. On 30 June this year, there were 706 patients who could not see, read clearly, look at television or walk in the vicinity of their homes due to blindness. These people must await operations for two and a half years or more. The budget has done nothing for these people. They listen to the radio and hear this blinding illusion of money being spent left, right and centre; they are given the impression that people are making a fortune.</P>
    <P>The society the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, spoke about this morning is becoming increasingly litigation conscious and greedy. The individ<Col N="388" /> ualising of the income tax code will drive people and families apart and create a great deal of aggression. I resent this. The Government in its collective wisdom could have spent the money much more wisely without creating these divisions. It is disgraceful as we enter the new millennium, with more money than we ever had, with £680 million put aside for a pension fund &ndash; I agree with this in principle &ndash; for a crisis that will not arise until 2040, that these hospital waiting lists still remain. Right now these people are being told that they will have their hip operation carried out in two years, their heart operation will be carried out some time next year and they will have their cataract operation carried out when they are completely blind. This is appalling treatment of thousands of people who deserve better.</P>
    <P>The future of this country depends on the brain power of our young people. It depends on their creativity, imaginative skills and human potential. The Tánaiste said recently that this is not about money, it is about imagination. I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, is present. There are three bases in County Mayo where there are groups of seven primary schools for remedial purposes. It is physically, educationally and mentally impossible for these remedial teachers, with the greatest of respect to them, given the distances they must travel to these schools, to give the children in these groups of schools the help they need if they are to have any chance of realising their full potential. Each day the remedial teacher does not attend these schools as a result of the long distances they must travel. These children are being disadvantaged. It is a disgrace that these children will be disadvantaged in the future because they are not receiving the hope and encouragement they deserve as a result of lumping together schools spread over huge distances. They are not being given the resources to realise their human potential and to become part of a young, vibrant and modern country.</P>
    <P>I would like to think the words of Government would ring true. The national plan was published recently. This created an illusion that everything would be rosy in the garden. An area west of Athlone known as the Border, midlands and western region, the BMW region, was given Objective One status and the Western Development Commission was set up. However, in two and a half years no money has been released despite the words of the Taoiseach on the steps of Dillon House in Ballaghaderreen. There have been no rail improvements of significance. We are on the hind tit again from Athlone to Westport and Ballina. A sum of £10 million was included in the national plan for regional airports over a six year period. There is no commitment from the Government to the proper development of Knock airport, yet £300 million is being spent on Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. There is a Bord Gáis proposal to extend the pipeline from Dublin through Athlone to Galway. Points west and north-west are not mentioned. There is a <Col N="389" /> second application for an interconnector from Scotland despite the fact that in the Corrib field, 35 miles off Achill Head, 1.3 trillion cubic metres of natural gas is just sitting there awaiting commercialisation. In an attempt to satisfy the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, Bord Gáis has ignored all points west and north-west. There is no major road from Derry through Letterkenny to Sligo or Galway. This region is ignored despite the fact that the Minister, Deputy McDaid, brought the ladies golf championship to Letterkenny in the middle of a storm.</P>
    <P>This budget has been cobbled together. There is no leadership, it is reactionary. I am surprised at the way in which the budget has been concocted in Government and presented to the nation. It is a zero wives at home budget; it is a zero allowance at home budget; it is an illusion. Ed Begley has gone on his way forever to his mortal reward but his ghost is alive and well in the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. He, too, came with the reputation of largesse; he, too, came with the reputation of endless wealth; he, too, came with the reputation of goodies for everybody. He is not a man for all seasons. When the detail of this budget is studied, it will be seen as anti-family, anti-people and very bad politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget contains many elements which impact positively on the work of my Department. Foremost among these would be support for the supply of child care facilities but there are other significant issues also to which I will refer briefly.</P>
      <P>As announced in the budget by the Minister for Finance, annual funding of £46.4 million is being provided for the implementation of the supports for child care service provision recommended by the interdepartmental committee on child care. As a result, my Department will have a budget for child care of over £250 million, including a provision from the national development plan, over the next seven years. This is a significant budget which will facilitate action to support objectives such as providing diverse child care which meets the needs of the child, increasing the number of trained personnel working in child care and improving the co-ordination and delivery of child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the driving forces of the remarkable performance of the economy in recent years has been the increase in the number of women participating in the workforce. Historically, women have been the primary child carers, principally by working full time in the home. The increase in <Col N="390" /> the number of women opting to combine work and family life has meant that this historical situation no longer applies. There is a growing demand for child care and this situation has been exacerbated by a reduction in the number of child care places available.</P>
    <P>I have been aware, as indeed has the Government, of the difficulties relating to child care provision. It is a complex and diverse area which required careful research and consideration. I am pleased to say that the Government fully supports the recommendations on the interdepartmental committee on child care in relation to supporting child care service providers and stimulating further supply.</P>
    <P>Child care has been highlighted as a priority for investment in the national development plan which is providing £250 million to support the provision of child care in the voluntary, community and private sectors over the next seven years. This represents the most significant investment by the State to date. The allocation of £250 million in the NDP will support measures which will have both a social inclusion and equal opportunities focus.</P>
    <P>Wednesday's budget announcement also provides for accelerated capital allowances for expenditure on child care and the allocation of funding to the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science. The allocation of funding to these three Departments will assist the development of out of school services by community groups, the development of after school services by the school management and the development of an advisory service by the health boards.</P>
    <P>The £250 million in the national development plan will support the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee on child care in relation to funding child care service delivery, including the expansion of the equal opportunities child care programme; funding towards the development of local child care network initiatives and a new capital grant scheme for child care providers caring for up to 20 children. To this end, my Department will shortly be promoting a number of child care initiatives designed to achieve these goals. We will be expanding the equal opportunities child care programme to include a number of strands including capital infrastructure and support for staffing costs for community based child care facilities in disadvantaged areas, development support for national voluntary child care organisations and expanding and improving the provision of child care training and support for innovative projects in the child care area. In addition, this funding will be used to encourage and enable people involved in child care to form networks, thereby reducing isolation, increasing quality through the dissemination of information and providing mutual support.</P>
    <P>A further element of my Department's programme will be the introduction of a capital grant <Col N="391" /> scheme for child care providers, including private providers who cater for up to 20 children. The purpose of this scheme will be to assist child care providers to upgrade their facilities thus helping them to provide a safe environment for the children under their care.</P>
    <P>The provision of £20.475 million in my Department's Estimate for the year 2000 includes the first tranche of funding &ndash; £13.7 million &ndash; from the national development plan and marks a 416% increase on the allocation for 1999. My Department has already commenced the drawing up of measures designed to achieve the objectives set out in the national development plan and is consulting with the relevant bodies. It is my intention that promotion of the new measures will commence shortly and that the application system devised will be open, clear and accessible to all potential applicants.</P>
    <P>It has been decided that the challenge of and responsibility for co-ordinating child care services will be assigned to my Department and I intend to establish a structure which will have three separate but interlinking co-ordination roles, namely, an interdepartmental committee on child care, a national co-ordinating child care committee and county child care committees. I will announce details of these committees tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Funding of over £25 million is being allocated to my Department in the national development plan for the establishment of an equal opportunities technical support unit within the Department and funding for positive action measures, approximately £4 million, is for the promotion of family friendly policies.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding allocated to my Department in the national development plan for child care and positive action measures, over £86 million is also being made available in the plan for social inclusion initiatives being undertaken by the Department. This will enable it to undertake new policy developments in the social inclusion area with a preventive and rehabilitative focus. It will fund a range of initiatives to prevent the involvement of young people aged ten to 18 in crime under a Garda youth diversion programme, provide pre-employment training and personal development courses for individuals who come to the attention of the criminal justice system under the Probation and Welfare Service and offer ex-offenders labour market relevant training while in prison with the objective of breaking the cycle of crime and reducing the rate of recidivism.</P>
    <P>The groups being targeted by this funding are among the most socially excluded in society. They exhibit classic characteristics of marginalisation, including low literacy levels, lack of labour market skills, substance abuse, addiction and homelessness. A large proportion of the people in these groups come from socially deprived areas and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is specially placed to interact with them.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £1 million was made in 1999 <Col N="392" /> to develop a further series of new and innovative programmes to be operated by the Probation and Welfare Service in association with community groups, businesses and other statutory agencies. These programmes target areas where no appropriate programmes for young offenders exist and there is the possibility of those at risk being taken into custody and they will aim to build on the expertise and best practice models already identified by the service.</P>
    <P>The initiative to which I refer will incorporate new &ldquo;outward bound&rdquo; programmes which will facilitate the monitoring of these young people at evening time and during weekends. New approaches are also being developed by introducing evening programmes for parents or spouses of offenders in training and apprenticeship or employment. It will give them opportunities and support in understanding adolescent and teenage development. It has been put in place with a view to giving new opportunities to young offenders under the age of 18 years who are either on probation or who will be released from detention under supervision. The objective is to reduce their offending and provide stability in their lifestyles. Apprenticeships and employment opportunities are central to achieving this objective and the intention is to bring employers together to identify and provide employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>When I entered office over two years ago, there were 12 Garda youth diversion projects in operation. I am pleased to say that this year my Department is funding 29 such projects at an annual cost of well over £1 million. Garda youth diversion projects play an invaluable role in the context of the Garda Síochána's liaisons with individual communities, in socially reintegrating disadvantaged youths in acutely disadvantaged areas and in making communities safer. The additional £16 million allocated over the life of the national development plan is clear proof of the Government's determination to ensure that the benefits of our national economic success are shared by all sections of the community and that the invaluable but unsung work being done throughout the country by voluntary bodies is recognised in a practical way.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to recently have the opportunity to acknowledge the positive and imaginative way the Kerry diocesan youth service has responded to the changing needs of the county by formally launching the &ldquo;Connect 7&rdquo; project, in respect of which I was glad to make £50,000 funding available earlier this year. I also allocated £250,000 to the Killarney youth centre through the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>

      <P>The Kerry diocesan youth service has established a good working relationship with the Probation and Welfare Service in Kerry. The youth service will provide a place where young people can become involved in constructive activities in an informal atmosphere. The grant for this excellent initiative will contribute to crime prevention, enable alienated young people to play an active part in altering their own conditions and accommodate a variety of programmes concerned with meeting the development needs of young people. The centre will prove to be a worthwhile resource to the local community in Killarney.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the special provision of £350,000 in the budget to support the operations of the transport organisation know as Vantastic. This organisation has provided a door-to-door transport service for people with disabilities in the Dublin area since 1994 as a way of addressing inadequacies in the availability of accessible public transport. It is a form of &ldquo;dial-a-ride&rdquo; for people with disabilities who are registered with the service. These funds will be made available to Vantastic in instalments during 2000, subject to the normal conditions that apply to the allocation of Exchequer funds.</P>
      <P>As I have often indicated, supporting victims of crime is a priority for the Government and in addition to the £655,000 for Victim Support contained in the Abridged Estimates, a further £200,000 is to be allocated to the group. This will allow it to complete its plans to establish a nationwide structure for the delivery of its services. It also provides funding to assist in the training needs of the restorative justice process from a victim's perspective and to explore the potential for co-operative initiatives by the agencies involved in the general area of victim support.</P>
      <P>The position of asylum seekers in Ireland has acquired greater significance with the increase in the number of asylum applications being made. It presented us with a challenge as it focused attention on the procedures and resources in place to process asylum applications. My officials are committed to processing applications for refugee status in accordance with our international obligations and domestic rules and procedures, with a view to providing the best service to all applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to confirm, as I have in the House on several occasions in recent weeks, that the Government is committed to providing and administering an immigration and asylum system which assures protection for refugees, respects and upholds the rights of all immigrants and provides open, fair and effective procedures. In an effort to meet the current demands placed on my Department by the unprecedented number of arrivals in recent months we must be committed <Col N="394" /> to providing the resources to meet them and the care that these people deserve. A cost attaches to providing an effective service, one which will meet the needs of that vulnerable group who seek the protection of the State. The Government has agreed to make an additional 120 staff available to my Department to meet these challenges at a cost of £6.5 million over three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Government for their recognition of and provision for two areas which come under my remit, namely adult education and youth services. The provision for literacy services in the budget means that I will have almost ten times the allocation to adult literacy than when I took office. This will enable me to increase the throughput of people who avail of such services &ndash; it has already doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 per annum; arrange for the provision of services in more humane locations; provide flexible delivery times; continue to work on professionalising the service; establish an adult guidance service; progress work in providing literacy tuition over the airwaves and undertake a number of useful projects which will ensure that the money is well spent and maximum value is obtained for it.</P>
      <P>I wish to put this issue in context. In 1995 the OECD carried out a survey of 15 member countries on the question of adult literacy. It was made available to the previous Government, which neglected to publish it. When I began to read files in my Department on assuming office, I was absolutely gobsmacked to discover that the annual provision for the relief of adult illiteracy was £850,000. I was further dumbstruck when I discovered a number of letters on file to then Minister, Niamh Breathnach, from organisations and various people working in the field, such as the National Adult Literacy Organisation, highlighting the results of the OECD survey and requesting increased funding.</P>
      <P>I was appalled at the tone of the then Minister's reply. She more or less regarded this as a Cinderella area, which was an adjunct to the Department and did not merit proper funding and support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 allocation for adult literacy services was increased by £60,000 over the 1996 figure. This was spread over 38 VEC areas, with approximately £1,700 provided for each. The OECD survey also demonstrated that people with literacy problems tended to be among the most marginalised and at the lower end of the income spectrum. They swelled the ranks of the long-term unemployed and the contribution of a party and a Minister who travelled the country masquerading as socialists before that most disad<Col N="395" /> vantaged and deprived group was an increase of £60,000.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party, who was then Minister for Finance and had it within his power to allocate funding, made disparaging remarks about my record in this regard in the House last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>My record is available for consideration alongside Deputy Quinn's and the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach's in this regard for any objective observer to analyse. I have always been consistent and transparent. I never felt the need to re-invent or transform myself as others have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the leader of the Labour Party has been transformed from Superman to Clark Kent.</P>
      <P>The increased allocation which I secured from the Minister for Finance will enable me to expand the literacy service. Almost £74 million has been allocated to such services in the NDP. This will allow us to put 110,000 people through the system during the lifetime of the plan. This complements the doubling of the number being educated currently. These measures, in addition to those taken by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, will ensure that the number of students leaving primary and secondary levels with literacy and numeracy difficulties is reduced annually. A substantial impact will be made on the adult literacy problem during the lifetime of the plan.</P>
      <P>However, adult education is about more than literacy. If people do not have the necessary literacy and numeracy skills, they will get nowhere. Increased funding for adult education generally will allow us to sweep away many barriers that obstruct people as they re-enter the education system, those who are not sufficiently educated to participate to the fullest extent in the information society. The implementation of an adult guidance system has begun. Specific provision has been made for child care in the education system, apart from the provisions made by the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest barrier for people re-entering the education system is the difficulty of combining education with work or domestic responsibilities. To overcome that problem, we have begun to provide Youthreach courses, VTOS and other schemes through which people traditionally return to the education system on a flexible, part-time basis whereby people can do one or two modules at a time, thus transforming the sector. It will be further transformed with the allocation of more than £74 million in the NDP, from the <Col N="396" /> Cinderella that it traditionally has been into the mainstream education system.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the provision of youth services. The allocation in this area has been increased by 28% over last year. It gives us the opportunity to introduce new schemes, such as the one I initiated which allocates grants directly to youth clubs, and to improve such services in many different, imaginative ways to ensure the best value for money in this sector. The youth services and people involved in adult education can be assured that their future is secure and that their interests will be properly considered under the stewardship of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, this has been a momentous week in the peace process and in the history of our island. Today, the British-Irish Agreement entered into force on the exchange of notifications between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State, confirming that all the necessary requirements had been completed. The North-South Ministerial Council, the Implementation Bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference have, therefore, all now been established.</P>
      <P>The entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement automatically obliged the Government to give effect to the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution which were approved by the people last year. The Government this morning made the necessary declaration.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the British Northern Ireland Act, 1998, at midnight last night an order devolving legislative and executive powers to Northern Ireland took effect. Devolved executive powers will be exercised by the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Séamus Mallon, and the ten Ministers nominated on Monday under the d'Hondt procedure. I understand that the Executive Committee met for the first time this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New British legislation governing the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, as provided for in the Agreement, has also taken effect. In addition, the IRA is today appointing an authorised representative to the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. I believe we are at the beginning of a new era of <Col N="397" /> lasting peace and partnership on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the House will know, none of these developments would have been possible without the success of the Mitchell review. Senator Mitchell's patience, determination and judgment were remarkable and he richly deserves our thanks and those of the people. All the pro-Agreement parties showed courage, vision and leadership. In particular, the UUP and Sinn Féin had to take and stand by difficult decisions and the SDLP provided vital and balanced insight and support.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Mitchell's belief that we will now see the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including decommissioning. The independent commission is the agreed mechanism for taking this forward and it should now be allowed to proceed with its work.</P>
    <P>We are determined to ensure the success of each and all of the institutions and other arrangements. The North-South Ministerial Council met yesterday in shadow form to agree a number of technical and procedural matters. The inaugural plenary meeting of the council will take place in Armagh on Monday, 13 December, when our delegation will be led by the Taoiseach. I expect that this meeting will consider a range of matters, including the council's future work programme and aspects of the Implementation Bodies, including their locations. The British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will have their first meetings shortly afterwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Mitchell's suggestion regarding a visit by the monarch, Queen Elizabeth, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, is meeting the Queen today with the President in London. At this stage of political development in Ireland and given the new relationships which have been put in place between the two islands as outlined by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, in his address to <Col N="398" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas last year, there is no reason such a visit by the monarch should not take place.

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The issue of accountability was to the forefront in the negotiations on Strand Two with the Northern Ireland parties. It was imperative that the bodies would be accountable to the respective parliamentary assemblies. I confirm that the line Ministers, such as those with responsibility for agriculture and transport, who will be involved in discussions with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on a range of co-operation and implementation measures, will at all times be accountable to the House. Similarly, the Ministers engaged in discussions in the North-South Ministerial Council will be accountable to the devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs contributed actively to discussions on this issue at a number of meetings of the EU General Affairs Council and underlined on a number of occasions, most recently at the General Affairs Council of 15 November, that crisis management is a broad spectrum including civilian as well as military dimensions. There is a need for effective and early EU approaches to conflict prevention and early warning, using non-military tools available. Ireland therefore welcomes and supports the Finnish Presidency's emphasis on non-military crisis management which is being pursued in parallel with the work on the Petersberg Tasks of military crisis management.</P>

    <P>At the meeting on 15 November, the Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasised to partners and to Javier Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP, the importance of bringing EU influence to bear at the earliest possible stage of a potential crisis and the positive role which Javier Solana <Col N="399" /> could play in elaboration and implementation of the EU's conflict prevention diplomacy.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Finnish Presidency's work on non-military crisis management, Ireland has actively contributed to an inventory of resources and capabilities within the EU which the Presidency has prepared in relation to non-military crisis management, including conflict prevention, covering such areas as UN and OSCE civil policing, humanitarian assistance and electoral and human rights monitoring. The Presidency has proposed an action plan in regard to non-military crisis management which incorporates a number of practical proposals intended to develop a rapid reaction capability in this field. A non-bureaucratic co-ordination mechanism has been proposed by the Presidency to maintain a database of relevant resources and, depending on the EU's role, to co-ordinate responses to particular crises. The EU's contribution will be in harmony with, and in support of, UN and OSCE efforts. Ireland supports this proposed action plan and we look forward to its submission to the Helsinki European Council.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with Deputy Mitchell's remarks about the successful signing today of the British-Irish Agreement, which replaces the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and the work which has been done recently in bringing the Good Friday Agreement to this point. We can all hope now that the various parties in Northern Ireland will work together to undermine the sectarianism that is still rampant there. It has not gone away and serious work needs to be done to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. My question asked what specific proposals the Government had made in relation to conflict prevention. The Minister of State outlined the steps the Finnish Presidency has taken to put this matter on the agenda. I welcome that move but does the Finnish action plan contain any proposals from the Irish Government? Did the Government put forward any proposals given that Ireland put great emphasis on that aspect of security in Europe and worldwide in the White Paper on foreign policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU, which has access to a broad range of instruments, political, diplomatic, humanitarian and financial, is well placed to contribute to conflict prevention in Europe and further afield. Peacekeeping responses within the framework of the Petersberg Tasks are important, but successful conflict prevention is a more desirable solution than dealing with the aftermath of a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, generally through its foreign policy, is very much to the fore in EU peacekeeping efforts around the world. We are significantly and uniquely placed to argue for a conflict resolution approach as distinct from coming in in the aftermath of a conflict. At every opportunity and at <Col N="400" /> every fora, Irish Ministers put forward this ideology.</P>
    <P>The question of a common strategy on conflict prevention has been under discussion in the EU. It is an idea which the Government supports. Work on such a common strategy is envisaged once the initial EU common strategies on Russia, Ukraine and the Mediterranean are assessed and reviewed. We will support the action plan as I have outlined in my substantive reply.</P>
    <P>There are further questions. Question No. 13 relates to the debate on the common security and defence policy. I will be dealing with that at a later point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State undertake to circulate the action plan to which she refers, which the Finnish Presidency has put forward? In addition, is she concerned, as I am, about the pace of change on the military defence front, that there seems to be a very much greater emphasis and priority being given to military co-ordination within Europe as against the idea of putting in place serious conflict prevention measures, which is more than diplomacy? In that context, does the Minister agree with the idea being promoted by the European Parliament that a civil peace corps should be established which would be a non-military intervention force or unit in situations where conflict has not yet broken out but is on the point of breaking out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to circulate that action plan. There have been concerns expressed that the security debate is developing at too rapid a pace. It is the case that some of our EU partners are more enthusiastic about the development of a common defence and security policy. However, this issue can only proceed on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam and by unanimity within the EU. Ireland is playing a full part in the discussions where our interests coincide closely with those of the other EU neutral partners. The Helsinki European Council will be a staging post in this debate, but will not mark the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      <P>As to the final point Deputy De Rossa makes in relation to a civil peace corps, I would be supportive of that, and I will undertake to get a more detailed note of our formal response to this matter and circulate it to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before turning to the substance of the Deputy's question, it may be useful if I set out for the House how the Helsinki European Council has been prepared. The Council of Ministers has advanced the preparatory work for this European Council in the normal way, namely in Brussels, with all member states participating, <Col N="401" /> under the direction of the Presidency. It remains for the General Affairs Council on 6 December to review the state of the preparations as a whole and to finalise work on issues for which it has particular responsibility. In parallel with this multilateral process, the President of the European Council, Prime Minister Lipponen, has been engaged in pre-Helsinki bilateral consultations with Heads of State or Government in capitals. As the Taoiseach told the Dáil yesterday, Prime Minister Lipponen was in Dublin on Tuesday, 30 November. His tour will be completed tomorrow and the Presidency will then make a final determination as to the issues it will propose for discussion at Helsinki and the manner in which it proposes to handle them. These decisions are the prerogative of the Presidency.</P>
      <P>The main foreign policy issues for discussion at Helsinki will be enlargement, common security and defence policy, the Intergovernmental Conference and the functioning of the Council in the perspective of enlargement, together with a small number of external relations issues, notably Russia, including Chechnya and the western Balkans security pact. I shall touch briefly on the Government's approach to these matters. Heads of State or Government will also consider economic policy co-ordination post-EMU, a proposed package of employment measures, environment issues and possibly taxation questions. A short millennium declaration is expected to be adopted.</P>
      <P>With regard to enlargement, we hope that the Helsinki European Council will provide the impetus to a broadening and deepening of the enlargement process, along the lines recommended by the Commission in its 13 October composite report. The question of whether to confer candidate status on Turkey is also likely to be discussed in this context.</P>
      <P>The Presidency will present a progress report to the Helsinki Council in response to the conclusions of the Cologne European Council on European security and defence matters. It is expected that this progress report will cover all aspects of crisis management, with the aim of enhancing the EU's ability to act at an early stage to prevent and resolve conflict, and to prevent and manage the kinds of crises which we have seen in the Balkans during this decade. The current aim of the EU, as set out at Cologne, is to take the necessary decisions in this area by the end of the year 2000. Discussion in preparation for the Helsinki Council has focused on the question of decision-making structures for Petersberg Tasks. Also of importance is the issue of the EU's ability and capabilities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's priority for the Helsinki Council in this area is that progress should be made in terms of the Amsterdam and Cologne objectives. The focus set out in Cologne is on the Petersberg Tasks, and not on collective defence. Security and defence issues within the EU are intergovernmental matters, subject to the sovereign decision of the member states. It is accepted that participation in the Petersberg Tasks is a vol<Col N="402" /> untary and sovereign decision for member states in each and every case.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Presidency will be submitting a report to the European Council taking stock of options in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference which is due to open early next year. On the basis of that report, Heads of State or Government will seek to confirm the agenda of the conference. Like most member states, Ireland favours a limited agenda which should focus on the institutional questions which need to be addressed before enlargement, notably the three such issues already identified, namely the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council.</P>
    <P>The European Council will also have before it a report from the General Affairs Council containing guidelines and recommendations for reform of the functioning of the Council with a view to ensuring its effectiveness in an enlarged Union. Such practical improvements, which must as appropriate respect existing balances, are important. I also expect Heads of State or Government to have an opportunity to discuss relations with Russia and the conflict in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>Clearly the EU's role in south-eastern Europe will be a priority for the Summit. In this context the Heads of State and Government are likely to discuss the stability pact. Much of the discussion in the framework of the stability pact has been diffuse and lacking in direction. The EU needs to give more direction to the stability pact.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that when I asked the Taoiseach about these matters on 16 November, he told the Dáil that he did not know whether Mr. Solana would have a report ready for the Helsinki Summit, he did not believe that he would, and that the summit would concentrate on enlargement. Will the Minister say how that statement can be reconciled with a statement made on the same day by Mr. Solana in the European Parliament in which he said he would be reporting on these matters to the Helsinki Summit? Does she agree that it is time we put up front the evolution of security, defence policy and defence matters in the European Union and stopped trying to pretend that evolution is not taking place? When are we going to get an up-front statement from the Government telling the people what is actually going on. Much has happened &ndash; the double-hatting of Mr. Solana, the report of the so-called Three Wise Men, the St. Malo Declaration, the Cologne Declaration, and now the Helsinki Summit. In the second half of next year the French Presidency will certainly move these things on. When can we expect the people to be told that this is happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on state<Col N="403" /> ments the Taoiseach made. Unfortunately, I am not aware of those statements. I tried to outline in my reply the various issues which will come up for discussion, and they are on the agenda for the Helsinki EU Summit. Clearly, the Presidency will be submitting a report to the European Council, taking stock of options in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference which is due to open early next year. On the basis of that report, Heads of State or Government will seek to confirm the agenda of the conference. Like most member states, Ireland favours a limited agenda which would focus on the institutional questions which need to be addressed before enlargement, notably, the three such issues already identified, namely, the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the possible extension of qualified majority voting at the Council.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State raise another issue at the Helsinki meeting? This is my concern that the Schengen agreement is being operated in such a way that not only will citizens of the 13 EU member states have free access to the European Union without passports, with the exclusion of Britain and Ireland, but that Norway and Iceland will also have access even though they are not members of the European Union. At the Helsinki meeting, will the Minister of State raise the possibility of Irish citizens travelling throughout the European Union on a lesser document than a passport but one which identifies the bearer as a citizen of the European Union, for example a driving licence? </P>

I will raise the matter and have an official do a note to the Deputy in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 25 years of involvement in development aid, the Irish Government has established a record of note as a donor. From small beginnings in 1974 the aid programme has <Col N="404" /> grown in content and range. It has built on experience, implementing a variety of programmes, projects and interventions best suited to the talents and resources Ireland can supply.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of pride for all of those who contributed to the building of the aid programme in the field and in Ireland that it was deemed earlier this year by the development assistance committee (DAC) of the OECD to be one with a reputation for quality aid. The findings of the DAC validated its work and pointed to the standard which the programme must now maintain.</P>
      <P>That standard is built on a strategy of poverty reduction and good governance. In implementation the programme focuses on partnership with recipient countries and co-operation with other donors and with NGOs. All of this is geared towards sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The aid programme has been growing continuously in range and volume since 1992. The figure for overseas development assistance for 1999 is expected to reach £178 million, estimated at 0.31% of GNP, by far the largest ever allocation for ODA.</P>
      <P>As the DAC report pointed out, this growth has been managed well but the capacity to manage has been severely strained, arising from the unequal rates at which financial resources and management capacity in the Department have grown. As a result of the conclusions of the peer review in this area, specifically those pointing to the need for effective administrative arrangements for a growing programme, management needs analysis of my Department has been carried out in recent months. This will now provide the basis for improved management arrangements which will facilitate effective programme implementation in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £178 million for 1999 was projected as 0.34% of GNP. Because of a new method of calculation of GNP the percentage of ODA to GNP has fallen back. This has been a difficulty over several years and is connected to the very rapid growth of the economy. Last year negotiations between me and the Minister for Finance managed to secure guaranteed cash increases over a three year period, essentially a multi-annual budget. The purpose of that was to make steady progress towards an interim target of 0.45% of GNP. Unfortunately this calculated upward trajectory towards reaching that interim target has been severely thrown off course by this new method of calculating GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the method of calculating GNP to which she refers was known about a year ago so it is not new? Would she agree that the argument I have repeatedly made that development aid should be <Col N="405" /> taken out of the annual Estimates wrangle and that we should legislate to meet the UN target of 0.7% by 2007 is the best way to proceed? Will the Minister of State tell the House how many children will die next year of easily preventable diseases which could be prevented if we and other EU member states were to increase our contribution? Would ten million be the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The new calculation for GNP was, I understand, known in the Department of Finance last year. My Department was not notified formally until September of this year that the figures for 1999 would be affected by the changed calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Or informally. I was not notified that there was a new calculation of GNP until September of this year. I hope the Deputy will accept that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Fine Gael proposal of setting a statutory basis for guaranteeing our upward trajectory to meet the UN target of 0.7%, I have an open mind and I would welcome a debate on that issue. The problem of following a rapid GNP growth affected the last Government and is affecting this Government's capacity to reach our international targets. It may well be that if there is cross-party consensus on a statutory basis for reaching the UN target we could agree to that. The annual wrangle regarding the Estimates is not pleasant and produced deep concern last year. I had thought I had managed to liberate the ODA budget from the annual Estimates wrangle by guaranteeing a three year programme of incremental upward movement towards a particular interim target. However GNP and the new method of calculating it has overtaken that. I am interested in discussing this matter further. I have an open mind on it.</P>
      <P>All our development programmes are focused on poverty reduction in the least developed countries, particularly in Africa. For that reason I am glad there is cross-party agreement that our overseas development budget must continue to grow in line with our international commitment and in solidarity with the poor of the world.</P>

      <P>Ireland assumed the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe at the Council's ministerial session in Strasbourg on 4 November. My colleague, Deputy Andrews, was pleased to be the sixth Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs to assume the position of chairman since Ireland joined the organisation as a founding member in 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his inaugural address to the Committee of Ministers, the Minister for Foreign Affairs set out <Col N="406" /> Ireland's programme and priorities for the chairmanship which will run until May 2000. That programme has been laid before the Oireachtas and is available for the information of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland assumed the chair of the Committee of Ministers our permanent representation to the Council of Europe has been involved in the day to day running of meetings of the Committee of Ministers' Deputies. The priority for the council under Ireland's chairmanship must be to continue to adapt itself to the new political realities of a changing Europe. The council must be able to respond to additional challenges such as those presenting themselves in the Balkans and in the Caucasus, including Chechnya. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear that, as chairman of the Committee of Ministers, he will do everything possible to assist in this.</P>
    <P>The Minister was pleased to host a lunch for the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Lord Russell Johnston, when he visited Dublin last week. Lord Russell Johnston's visit coincided with the release of the publication <i>Ireland and the Council of Europe Today, </i>produced by our permanent mission in Strasbourg in partnership with the Council of Europe and detailing Ireland's relationship with the Council. A separate educational pack on the Council produced through a similar partnership with the Irish chairmanship will be widely circulated in schools in the country. Preparations are ongoing for several events associated with our chairmanship.</P>
    <P>Ireland is organising a human rights seminar in conjunction with the Venice Commission and the Council of Europe Human Rights Directorate, to take place in Dublin in March 2000. A key aim of the seminar is to promote more effective interaction between international organisations in the field of human rights protection. A series of meetings have been held in Dublin and Strasbourg to finalise the agenda and speakers for the seminar, who will include the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson. Papers from this seminar will be published as part of Ireland's contribution to celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is also involved in preparations for the Council of Europe Conference on Social Development, which will take place in Dublin in January 2000 to finalise the Council's contribution to the UN special session on social development in June 2000.</P>

      <P>It would be appreciated if the Minister could find time early in the new year to attend a meeting of the Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights to outline how she is getting on with her work at the Council of Europe. Will the Minister outline how she sees the Council of Europe and the European Union evolving in terms of their mutual roles? For example, the <Col N="407" /> European Union has sought to bring about an observatory on racism and xenophobia. It may well be that this is a job better done by the Council of Europe. What co-operation exists and what will Ireland do to promote co-operation to ensure there is not an increase in overlapping responsibilities and, where it exists, that it is rationalised and done in a mutually co-operative way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be best to avoid any overlapping in dealing with human rights issues. As I understand it, and as outlined in my reply, the plans in place for Ireland's Presidency are along the lines of anticipating what changes will come about in respect of the applications on enlargement of the Union. Enlargement of the Council, based on democratic institutions and human rights, is an essential element for the continued reconstruction of Europe. There is a complementarity there in that the whole point of having a European Union was to assist in peace and stability in the continent of Europe. We agree that enlargement should be inclusive but not unconditional. Ireland hopes that with active assistance from the Council the remaining applicant countries will bring their institutions and legislation in line with this requirement and resolve any conflicts between them so that they may be able to join at the earliest opportunity. There are many challenges facing countries in Europe, such as Bosnia Herzegovina, and issues in Kosovo, Turkey and Chechnya, which are vitally relevant to the Council of Europe. Ireland will use its Presidency to articulate our concerns on human rights particularly in the European context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister did not refer to my suggestion about attending a meeting of the sub-committee and perhaps she will do so when replying again. On this day in Ireland where unity in diversity is being given true recognition, will she agree the Council of Europe can promote a similar principle throughout the whole of Europe where there would be unity in diversity and that the place to start is with young people? It is young people who start name-calling whether it is proddy-woddy or some other term relating to somebody's colour, creed or whatever. Throughout Europe, whether in Germany or in Ireland where there are serious problems, there is a need to educate young people against racist and xenophobic tendencies. Will the Minister confirm that during Ireland's Presidency priority will be given to promoting such youth education programmes thoughout the Council of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is a good one. There are initiatives in place but they need to be strengthened in the context of the challenges presenting in Ireland in terms of xenophobia and the need to encourage diversity and respect for different cultures and minorities. The NCDE is the body which expends funds on behalf <Col N="408" /> of the State in relation to development education and human rights education. I agree more needs to be done particularly in view of the changes in our Constitution which recognise cultural diversity and respect for people of all traditions as is fitting in a true republic, that we should move to counter signs of racism which have demonstrated themselves of late. One of the measures which is being considered by the Government, following a special meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee to deal with the whole immigration issue, is a public awareness programme to deal with promoting tolerance in our society, which starts at school level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9, 33, 83 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the request for details of the amounts committed in the past three years to individual countries, all of the information sought and much more is contained in the annual reports of the Irish aid programme, copies of which I will, for ease of reference, have placed in the Library of the House. Information culled from these <Col N="409" /> sources has been collated in tables for each of the three years and is circulated with this reply.</P>
    <P>These tables show only the funds which can be specifically linked to the countries concerned. Funds expended through NGOs, fellowships, the European Union, United Nations, other multilateral organisations and various trust funds do not easily lend themselves to geographic breakdown and are not included. Neither are figures included for the expenditure of Agency for Personal Service Overseas &ndash; APSO &ndash; which produces its own detailed statistics annually. I am arranging for a copy of the agency's annual report for the last year to be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>Official Development Assistance for 1999 is an estimate. All of the components which make up ODA will not be fully known until well into next year. As with the above information, details on ODA for previous years are contained in the annual reports on the Irish development aid programme. The following is our calculation of the breakdown of the 1999 ODA estimate:</P>

    <P>Multilateral aid comprises: payment by the Department of Finance to the International Development Association of the World Bank; payment by the Department of Finance to multilateral debt relief schemes of the World Bank; payment by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the Global Environment Facility; payment by the Department of <Col N="410" /> Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the World Food Programme, the Food Aid Convention and the various development schemes of the food and agriculture organisation; payment by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the European Development Fund; payment by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, various UN agencies and funds and the element of the Irish contribution to the EU budget used for aid purposes.</P>
    <P>Bilateral aid comprises: the Bilateral Aid Programme; the Agency for Personal Service Overseas; Emergency Humanitarian Assistance and Programme refugees.</P>
    <P>Administration is made up of: the element of the cost of development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is borne on the other Foreign Affairs vote, Vote 38; the amount either paid over or foregone by the Revenue Commissioners arising from contributions to registered Irish charities working in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The issue of the target for IDA was dealt with extensively in my reply to six questions in the House on 2 November. The following is a short reprise of what I said then.</P>
    <P>We accept and are committed to reaching the UN target for all donors of 0.7% of GNP. Our efforts to make progress to this target have been complicated by the high growth in GNP in the last few years and the recent switch to a new system of calculating GNP which increases the base figure. Despite this, the Government is pledged to increasing ODA by significant cash amounts year on year and to making credible progress to the UN target and to the interim target we have set of 0.45% of GNP. The three-year agreement on allocations is evidence of the Government's determination on the matter.</P>

    <P>Proinsias De Rossa: I thank the Minister for a useful reply in terms of the breakdown of Ireland's contributions and the various routes by which money is channelled at European and world level. Will the Minister of State outline the level of aid she expects for 2000? Will it meet the commitments the Minster for Finance made to her last year when she negotiated for the three year period? Is she concerned, as I am, about the current stance of the EU Council of Ministers on which Ireland is represented? It insists that aid to Kosovo be covered by a cut in aid to developing countries. The European Parliament has rejected this approach while the Council of Ministers is maintaining its position. Does she agree that this will lead to a clash between the two bodies? What position is the Government taking in the Council of Ministers?</P>

      <P>The agreement reached with the Minster for Finance last year covered the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. The total package amounted to £400 million. The figure in 1999 was higher than expected at £178 million. I expect an increase of approximately £26 million next year on that part of the budget administered by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to increasingly depend on other Departments to be part of our overall reckoned ODA. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently entered an agreement to pay $1 million to enable Ireland become a founding member of an organisation connected with the WTO to enable the least developed countries to get advice on the negotiations. Similarly, the Department of Finance will be encouraged by me and others to increasingly contribute to debt relief mechanisms, including the HIPC and other World Bank initiatives, to relieve the burden of debt on the least developed countries. In terms of the budget administered by my Department and the subheads over which I have control, I am satisfied I have sufficient money to deal with our planned management and development of that pro<Col N="416" /> gramme over the next three years. Certainly, I would like more money.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulty on aid to Kosovo to which the Deputy referred. The cut in aid is having an unfair impact on the least developed countries. At the last Development Council meeting we were very vocal in expressing our concerns.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State have an estimate of the number of children who will die next year from easily preventable diseases in this area of the developing world? Will it be ten million? We must be specific if we are to get people to support increases in development aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be specific because child mortality rates have improved, especially in the Third World. At the same time, in some countries many of the gains in development over the past decade are now being reversed by the awful spectre of AIDS, which especially affects babies and children, many of whom die before they reach their fifth birthday. Given this, I am sure the Deputy agrees that we need to continually argue for increases in aid in the international community where, regrettably, there has been a decline in donor generosity by some OECD countries. We are tenth in a list of 21 donors, so in terms of our ODA contributions our performance is respectable. It still needs to improve but, unfortunately, there is donor fatigue and constant advocacy is needed to retain solidarity on the issue of helping the poorest in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Our ongoing contacts with the Romanian authorities, which cover a wide range of issues, include discussion of matters arising in the immigration area. In the course of these contacts the Romanian authorities have indicated that they share our concern at the problem of <Col N="417" /> illegal immigration and are anxious to contribute to its resolution, consistent, of course, with our respective international obligations. While there does not, therefore, appear to be any basis for representations of the kind indicated by the Deputy, we will continue to keep all aspects of this matter under review.</P>
      <P>The factors which contribute to the current increase in immigration, which is not confined to any single country or region of origin and is shared by almost all our European Union partners, are complex and require an appropriately comprehensive response. This is the basis on which the Government is currently undertaking a full-scale review of all aspects of asylum and immigration policy. This is designed to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place with respect to asylum seekers, refugees and economic immigrants. This is essential to ensure that Ireland continues to discharge fully its international obligations, while at the same time realising the many advantages, economic and social, of Ireland's development as a diverse and multi-cultural society.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that many of those fleeing Romania are termed gypsies and are under persecution, but that this refers only to a small number of Romanians and that many people fleeing Romania are not under the kind of persecution experienced by that minority? Does she also agree that Romania is a potentially wealthy country and that it has the capacity, in terms of mineral wealth, to develop? Given this, Does she agree that as part of an overall immigration policy, which is clearly needed, investment by Ireland and other EU states in these countries to help them to develop and use their potential would contribute to a partial resolution of these difficulties? Does she also agree that this is another reason why a major step forward is required in the area of overseas development aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Romania is a democratic country and is scheduled to join the EU. I agree it would appear that many of those fleeing the country and seeking asylum here will be found to be economic migrants rather than asylum seekers. The most recent figures on asylum seekers indicate that Romania currently comprises the single largest group by country of origin. The official Romanian position is that there are no grounds for a person to flee the country to seek asylum. However, in line with our international obligations we must make such a determination, in due course of law as provided for by the Oireachtas, if a person applies for asylum.</P>
      <P>Ireland may make readmission agreements with other countries of origin, such as Romania, to provide for the civilised return of their citizens if, under the convention, they are found not to be refugees but economic migrants. In this regard preliminary discussions with the Romanian authorities are ongoing.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to praise the stance taken by the Minster of State on the issue of migration, refugees and asylum seekers. It compares well with the stance taken by some of the backbenchers of the party with which she is in Government. Does she agree that, as a phenomenon, migration is as old as the human race and that this island would be empty, populated only by bears and wolves, but for the fact that many centuries ago tribes chose to traverse the European Continent and arrive here? Does she also agree that if we go back far enough we are all migrants? Recognising that reality and also recognising that no matter how well developed other economies may be, does she agree that people will continue to want to migrate? On that basis, would she agree that it is incumbent on the Government to produce at least a discussion document on a immigration policy for the State? I proposed this some time ago in this House. There has not been any response of which I am aware other than a piecemeal approach by the Department on regulation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on Monday, 29 November, the Taoiseach convened a meeting of Ministers and Secretaries General of various Departments to initiate a comprehensive review of the area of immigration to take a multi-dimensional approach to the issue of economic migrants, illegal immigration and asylum seekers because in the past it had been dealt with in a single-faceted way. It is high time that Ireland, as a modern civilised country with a fast-growing economy, put in place a comprehensive set of policy initiatives and procedures to deal with this phenomenon.</P>
      <P>It is not a new phenomenon but it is fairly new for this country. The mass movement of peoples fleeing economic deprivation, famine and conflicts, particularly in the Third World, is now a feature of all European states. Last year 450,000 people applied for asylum in 29 industrialised countries. Ireland received approximately 4,000 of those people seeking asylum.</P>

      <P>The plight of those who have been forced to leave their homes areas as a result of paramilitary threats or intimidation, and also of their families, is a cause of serious concern to the Government. We fully endorse the right of those concerned to have the threats against them lifted and to return home.</P>
      <P>The Government, in its communications with parties with influence on paramilitary groups, has called on them to do everything possible to help resolve this unacceptable situation. In this regard, we have emphasised that the Good Friday Agreement, in its section on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, recognises &ldquo;the right to freely choose one's place of residence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issue is also raised regularly with the British Government through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. In the most recent discussions on the issue, the British authorities again indicated that statistics specifically relating to expulsions are not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret, despite the fact that this question was raised a month ago, and has been raised consistently over a long period, that the Government has not yet produced any statistics on, or even a guesstimate of, the numbers involved. We all know that there are young people being maimed and threatened with being killed unless they leave Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Was the issue specifically raised within the context of the negotiations which have recently concluded as part of arriving at the current situation, say, on decommissioning, etc., in that this is a necessary step also for the normalisation of society in Northern Ireland? Will the Minister of State indicate if she considers that it is necessary to move speedily on the issue of policing, now that the consultation process on the Patten report has concluded, and the reform of the RUC in order to deal with this issue also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be clear where the Government stands on all acts of violence and intimidation, including punishment beatings, active intimidations, threats and the continuing sectarian attacks in some areas of Northern Ireland. We condemn them absolutely and unequivocally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The politics and the political agreement which has now been copperfastened by institutions and the reform of policing, offer the best guarantee <Col N="420" /> that violence will be put behind us for good. The progress of recent weeks has brought us a further step closer to that goal.</P>
    <P>On the difficulty in getting statistics for the number of expulsions, as they are called, given the nature of the problem, neither the groups involved in making the threats nor those who receive them are likely to make information on numbers available. In recent consultations with the British authorities on the matter it was confirmed that figures are not maintained on the numbers of people forced to leave Northern Ireland and it is not feasible to try and collate such figures.</P>
    <P>The Victims' Commissioner, Mr. John Wilson, noted in his report that a number of those affected by paramilitary exiling are residing in this jurisdiction and the Government is currently examining measures aimed at alleviating their plight. This is being carried out in the context of the Government's consideration of the report of the Victims' Commission, which addressed the issue of the exiled in detail. The Victims' Commissioner has made a number of concrete recommendations to assist those exiled, including possible arrangements to facilitate those who wish to return home to Northern Ireland. These recommendations, together with&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be a valid issue to raise with the newly appointed Ministers of the new Northern Ireland Executive. Certainly these are some of the issues which we will hope to deal with in the context of a bedding down of the peace. The new institutions which have been established this week are the bedrock on which the permanent peace, which includes an end to all of these paramilitary style activities, will be built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the earlier question because the Minister of State did not have a chance to reply to it, that is, the question of policing. Given that the consultation period on the Patten report has now concluded, would she consider that moving speedily on the issue of reform of the RUC would be a significant element of solving this problem also because clearly the acceptability of a police force in a community will lead to the community being unwilling to accept this kind of paramilitary activity in its area?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we need to accelerate the implementation of the recommendations of the Patten Commission. Clearly those recommendations offer an opportunity for a fresh start to policing to build a police service in Northern Ireland which has the support and allegiance of all of the community. It is extremely important that young nationalists and young Catholics join the newly reformed police service. Every effort should be made to implement the comprehensive recommendations of Chris Patten and to insist that there should not be cherry-picking of the various recommendations. Now that the consultation process has been brought to an end, the Government will press for the fast-forwarding of the recommendations as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Does she agree that favourable consideration should be given to the valid requests from various interests, including elected public representatives and statutory bodies, in Counties Cavan and Monaghan to have such headquarters located in that region. As the Minister of State is aware, that region has suffered immeasurable damage economically, politically and socially over a period of 30 years.

No decisions have been taken and since these options have yet to be reviewed and agreed at political level, in fairness to the new Ministers in Northern Ireland, it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the decisions or express a preference for locating any of the implementation bodies. These matters will be discussed at the earliest opportunity at the inaugural meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which is scheduled for 13 December in Armagh.</P>

It suffers from a lack of regional and economic development in the same way as the west of Ireland does. The Minister should favourably consider valid requests from less developed regions for decisions at North-South Ministerial Council level to achieve the required regional economic development. That is the policy option outlined in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the Good Friday Agreement. I am sure that members of the new Executive in the North will be working towards that particular programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has expressed its total opposition to the use of the death penalty on a number of occasions over the past number of years, most recently in the House on 29 September last, and in the Seanad on 17 February. The Government has stressed its commitment to avail of every suitable opportunity to press for the abolition of capital punishment. The Government's view is that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. The EU has continued to focus on promoting the universal abolition of the death penalty. As a step in this direction, in June 1998, EU Foreign Ministers agreed guidelines stating that where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In the case of Turkey, since 1984 the Justice committee of the Turkish parliament has not referred death penalty cases for a plenary parliamentary vote, and no death sentence has been carried out in Turkey in that period. There has thus been a virtual moratorium on the death penalty in Turkey in recent years. Our views were communicated directly to the then speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly during his visit to Dublin last March and he responded positively to my concerns. Our strong views are regularly put to the Turkish authorities, both bi-laterally and on the occasion of EU-Turkey contacts.</P>
      <P>The decision by Turkey's appeals court, on 25 November, to uphold the death sentence against Mr. Abdullah Ocalan led to widespread international appeals, including by the European Union, to spare Mr. Ocalan's life. Ireland strongly supports the appeal to Turkey not to execute Mr. Ocalan. I will continue to follow proceedings in this case with the closest attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State raised the Ocalan case with the Turkish Ambassador and, if so, what response did she receive? Like the Minister of State, I also raised the matter with the speaker of the Turkish parliament when he was in Dublin with his deputation. If Turkey is serious about its application for EU membership, has it given an undertaking that the death penalty will be abolished? It is not consist<Col N="424" /> ent with membership of the European Union. As the EU is taking Turkey's application for membership more seriously, one could reasonably expect Turkey to take its own application more seriously. Has our ambassador in Turkey raised the matter with the authorities there? Will we be raising this matter with Turkey during our presidency of the Council of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply, this matter has been raised with the Turkish authorities on several occasions. I have not met personally with the Turkish ambassador to discuss his country's stance on the death penalty. However, the Turkish authorities have been made aware of our concerns over several years of contacts with Irish Ministers and officials. I agree that the situation does have a detrimental effect on the prospects for Turkey's candidacy for EU membership. The EU has continued to focus on promoting the universal abolition of the death penalty. It has pointed out to Turkey that the execution of Mr. Ocalan would delay its recognition as a candidate for EU accession for a very long time. Together with its EU partners, Ireland considers adherence to the Copenhagen criteria, including recognition of minorities and respect for their rights, to be an essential political qualification for EU accession. As an application has now been made by Mr. Ocalan's lawyers to the European Court of Human Rights, the matter is <i>sub judice</i>. However, Ireland will use every opportunity provided by its chairmanship of the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe to further the total abolition of the death penalty, which is a core value and principle of the Council of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I made clear in my reply that if Turkey proceeds with the execution of Mr. Ocalan it will seriously jeopardise the country's status as a candidate for EU accession. If a state retains the death penalty on its statute book, it is clearly a very significant aspect of accession to the EU.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree with the Greek Prime Minister that establishing proper human rights norms in Turkey should not be considered as concessions? These are not negotiating positions. It is a <i>sine qua non</i> that human rights norms should be established in any state that seeks to become a member of the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of good governance and compliance with international human rights norms is one of the significant criteria which is considered in relation to the status of countries who wish to become members of the European <Col N="425" /> Union. This is not unique to Turkey. Other states are anxious to join the European Union but they will have to live up to and comply with normal human rights standards in civilised states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 44 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council on 15 November reviewed progress since the Cologne Summit on how the EU, acting on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam, can have a more effective role in the conduct of Petersberg Tasks, and also in non-military aspects of crisis management. The Finnish Presidency intends to draw up a progress report for the Helsinki European Council, comprised of two subsidiary reports on military and non-military aspects, respectively.</P>
      <P>In the context of the EU discussions on Petersberg Tasks, in the light of the Amsterdam Treaty and the conclusions of the Cologne European Council, particular consideration is being given to questions of decision-making procedures and crisis management capabilities. The Cologne conclusions underlined the importance of UN principles in this connection.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of capabilities, a British proposal for a capability target of 40,000, which is about the size of KFOR in Kosovo, is one of the ideas that has been put forward and is being studied carefully. It is important to emphasise that participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis, and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case. There is no question of a European Army being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the most recent General Affairs Council on 15 November, Defence Ministers of the 15 member states were invited by the Finnish Presidency to participate in the discussions, particularly with reference to the question of military capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, contrib<Col N="426" /> uted to this discussion, emphasising the strong and long-standing tradition in UN peacekeeping and crisis management which we are bringing to the EU table. The focus of the debate has been on voluntarily agreed goals which should enable a better practical focus on peacekeeping and crisis management. The EU discussions are not concerned with collective defence.</P>
    <P>The other main issue discussed has been decision making, so that the EU can take effective and informed decisions on Petersberg Tasks when necessary. Final decisions are not foreseen until the end of the year 2000. In the meantime, there may be a need for interim structures in Brussels, which would be geared to ensure effective implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty's provisions on Petersberg Tasks &ndash; a political and security committee has been proposed, as has a committee with military expertise which would advise the political and security committee, as appropriate. The need for access to sound military expertise and advice is clear from the experience in UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>One sensitive area is the issue of consultation procedures with non-EU countries which are following this debate carefully and, in some cases, with a degree of concern. I would hope to see appropriate consultation procedures set up.</P>
    <P>The question of EU contacts with NATO has also been discussed, in view of the reality that the EU and Western European Union, which do not wish to duplicate the resources existing within NATO, are likely to be dependent on NATO resources for peacekeeping activities. As I said in response to a priority question today from Deputy De Rossa, in parallel with this work, the Presidency has been seeking to improve the EU's non-military crisis management capabilities. I see this work as very important.</P>
    <P>Javier Solana has an important role to play in relation to Petersberg Tasks. With the retirement of the current Western European Union Secretary General, the Western European Union members see a need for closer working links with the EU on Petersberg Tasks. The EU neutral states, including Ireland, came to the conclusion that Mr. Solana's second job does not affect our neutrality. At the insistence of the neutral partners, the EU has made clear that the decision does not affect the position of the Treaty of Amsterdam, nor the Cologne conclusions which define the EU's role in relation to the Petersberg Tasks, and that it will have no implications arising out of the Western European Union's Article V clause.</P>
    <P>The GAC of 15 November also noted the inconclusive work on armaments co-operation which has been under way for several years now. Ireland does not manufacture arms. Our priority is to ensure effective restraints on arms exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already dealt with this, to some extent, under Priority Questions. However, I want to pursue a number of aspects. Why is the Government opposed to col<Col N="427" /> lective security of the European Union? What is the Government's attitude to the clear drive towards creating a single, modernised arms industry, with a view to making a contribution to a European defence arrangement, whatever that might be?</P>
      <P>Is Ireland making its voice heard in the current debates within the European Union on nuclear deterrence? What is the Government's position on that? Given the Government's current stance, are we likely to end up, having not engaged in the debate, with a European defence arrangement which includes nuclear deterrence? We can stand back and say our hands are clean, but we will have nuclear deterrence in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the reason the Government is reluctant to get involved in the discussion on a common security and defence policy is our neutrality. I know that causes difficulties and that there are different views in Ireland on this matter. The confused debate on our membership of PfP is a manifestation of that.</P>
      <P>The PfP plays an important role in co-operation and planning for the Petersberg Tasks. The Minister for Foreign Affairs signed Irish membership of PfP yesterday. He made it clear there was no question of Ireland joining NATO, now or in the future. Ireland, with our capacity and experience in UN peacekeeping, would far rather focus on conflict prevention than on military crisis management. We dealt with this early during Priority Questions.</P>
      <P>Ireland takes a positive view of the outcome of the Cologne Summit, which clearly reflected the views of the four neutral EU member states. The Cologne declaration meets our key concerns in a number of areas. It is clearly situated in the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty. The issue is cleared defined as the Petersberg Tasks, and not mutual defence commitments which are appropriate to alliances. Most importantly, the declaration does not contain prejudicial references to the integration of the Western European Union as an institution into the EU. We can look at including Western European Union's peacekeeping and crisis management functions into the EU, but not the Western European Union's Article V clause. This is a mutual defence commitment which binds Western European Union members. The principles of the UN charter are highlighted and the rights of the EU neutrals in participation in the Petersberg Tasks are clearly registered.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's question about why we are not in favour of a common security and defence policy, it is very much related to our reluctance to become involved in heavy-handed security policy, which some other EU member states are more in favour of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest we are now in a circular argument &ndash; we are against collective security because we are neutral, and we are neu<Col N="428" /> tral because we are against collective security. That is not an answer to the question. There are all kinds of definitions of neutrality. The latest one is a quote in <i>The Irish Times</i> from the Minister, Deputy Andrews, who said Ireland would maintain &ldquo;moral neutrality&rdquo;. I am not sure whether he means we will be morally neutral or our neutrality will be moral. What exactly does he mean?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably appropriate because my question is along the same lines as that of Deputy De Rossa. I interpreted the Minister of State as saying that we are neutral because we are neutral. On this day, when the matters in Northern Ireland have moved along in a fantastic way, we must recall that the only basis for not joining NATO in 1949 was partition. I accept that situation has moved on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should let me make my point. I accept the situation has moved on and that many other matters have happened in relation to NATO. However, why, in terms of European Union security, are we keeping our heads down, letting others make the running and reacting to what they are saying? Why have we not got a handle on this ourselves? Why are we not managing it proactively? Why have we not got a view on what European Union security architecture should be? Why are we not one of the architects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, perhaps, a need for a modern definition of what neutrality means in the context of our membership of the European Union. Clearly, Ireland would be anxious to participate in peacekeeping, conflict prevention and other humanitarian endeavours. We are contributing to KFOR and SFOR in Bosnia. However, in common with other neutral states, we are carefully watching and participating in this debate. <Col N="429" /> We have to be mindful that any change in our neutrality or proposed membership of a military alliance would have to be put directly to the people. If that is to be the case then let the debate begin. Membership of PfP gave rise to some confusion as to how Ireland views its role in the world in terms of being&mdash;</P>

      <b>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development </b>
    </P>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): I commend the Minister for Finance on the radical and innovative budget he introduced yesterday. Managing a successful economy is in many ways as challenging as managing economic difficulties. However, this budget strikes the right balance between sustaining economic growth, lessening the tax burden and promoting social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The extent of our success is striking by any standards in the management of the general economy. For example, during the 1990s the economy has grown by over 7% per annum and by over 9% per annum since 1993. Ireland is set to top the OECD league in 1999 for the fifth year in a row, with growth almost three times the OECD average. The economy's performance has seen huge increases in employment, and unemployment has fallen from 15% in 1993 to about 5% in 1999. Ireland has managed to combine strong growth with low inflation. Falling interest rates have also helped to support competitiveness.</P>
    <P>At the same time, Government debt has been reduced dramatically. Debt as a percentage of GDP is forecast to drop to about 47% by the end of 1999, an almost unimaginable figure when one recalls that it stood at 120% of GNP in 1988. Therefore, this budget has to be seen in the context whereby people have better living standards, better job opportunities and a better economic environment than at any time in our history. The budgets introduced by this Government, together with the National Development Plan, will lay the foundation for sustainable economic prosperity over the next decade and further into the future.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to agricultural incomes. The general economic situation has also benefited farm families. In particular, lower interest rates directly benefit farmers. Interest payments now account for around 11% of farm income compared to almost 30% in the early 1980s. It is easy to forget that some of the most serious difficulties which confronted farm families were due to high interest rates. Over the 1990s, average farm incomes in real terms have out-performed most other EU members states. There has been a real increase of 21% in Ireland compared with 12% in the EU as a whole in the period 1990 to 1998. There have been acute farm income difficulties in the last three years. Last year was an extremely difficult year because we also had fodder problems. This year the sheep and pig industries in particular are going through a difficult time. I am making every effort to alleviate the difficulties faced by these farmers.</P>
    <P>When talking about farm incomes, we must remember that only half of farm household income now derives from farming activities. There has been a huge increase in the number of farm holders and their spouses availing of the increased off-farm employment opportunities now thankfully available in many rural areas. On 44% of farms, either the holder or spouse has an off-farm job. I welcome the development of part-time farming as a means of maintaining farm <Col N="431" /> household viability. This area requires more research and I would like Teagasc surveys to provide me with more detailed information as we need to know about our clients when making policy. There are about 150,000 farm families and we need to know about them. While we have very valuable information on farm incomes from the CSO and Teagasc, information on total household income is scarce.</P>
    <P>I would like to place the specific measures provided for the agri-food sector in this budget in the wider policy context. EU and international developments probably have a greater influence on this sector than on any other. At a national level there has been a recognition of the importance of wider rural development issues. There can be no doubting the significance of agriculture to the Irish economy and of the importance of the favourable outcome achieved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations. We also had the White Paper on Rural Development and the National Development Plan which put substance and finance to the aspirations in those plans. In keeping with the Government's commitment in the White Paper on Rural Development, £6.7 billion has been earmarked for agriculture and rural development, including infrastructural expenditure which includes £3.7 billion for measures specific to my Department. The latter amount represents a 50% increase on the previous period and I would now like to briefly outline the main areas of expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>We are at present preparing a CAP rural development plan which covers four major measures: the continuation of the REPS agri-environment measure, early retirement, headage and forestry planting. The latter is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. This plan involves overall public expenditure of £3.4 billion, of which £1.7 billion will be provided by the EU from the guarantee fund.</P>
    <P>As regards Structural Funds, I am also happy to announce substantial funding for on-farm capital investment schemes, such as the control of farmyard pollution, installation aid and the dairy hygiene schemes, and necessary funding for the Teagasc advisory, research and training facilities. These measures will be implemented through the new productive investment and employment inter-regional programmes and funding allocated amounts to £389 million. In line with the emphasis on achieving balanced regional development in the coming period, the remaining funding of £172 million will be allocated to new rural development type measures as well as farm diversification measures. An additional £35 million will be provided by the EU for a new specialised Leader programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the main points of the budget. There are significant improvements for farmers and rural areas. This year I sought measures that would aid land mobility, improve the competitiveness of the agri-food industry and <Col N="432" /> enhance our environmental policy. This budget has come through in each of those areas. Young farmers are the key to the future of the agriculture industry. They are likely to be better motivated, more energetic and more willing to innovate. For this reason Government policy favours the early transfer of farms to the next generation. The raising of the thresholds for capital acquisitions tax, in particular the Class 1 threshold applying to parents, will have a major impact on the transfer of agricultural assets to young farmers. When taken in combination with the 90% agricultural relief, this means that virtually all family farm transfers will be exempt from capital acquisitions tax. For example, a qualifying farmer may inherit a farm worth up to £3 million from a parent without the transferee becoming liable for CAT.</P>
    <P>The two-thirds stamp duty relief for young trained farmers was to expire on 31 December 1999 but will now be continued for three years to 31 December 2002. In addition, there are a range of incentives aimed at encouraging the early transfer of farms, the continuation of installation aid, the early retirement scheme and the 100% stock relief. Farmers over 55 years who lease out their land on a long-term basis are exempt from income tax on the rental income arising, up to a limit of £4,000.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Finance Act provided for a 30% reduction in the market value of agricultural property when computing probate tax and this budget increased the exemption threshold for estates from £11,250 to £40,000. The budget also sees an increase in the threshold for retirement relief on capital gains tax. This is a relief allowed to individuals aged 55 years or more on the disposal of business assets owned for ten or more years and has been increased from £250,000 to £375,000, an increase of 50%. A 20% rate of capital gains tax will apply to the disposal of assets which were still liable to the 40% rate &ndash; a 50% reduction &ndash; that is, the disposal of non-residential development land and the disposal of residential development land to connect persons. This is one of the measures that farming organisations requested be included in the budget.</P>
    <P>Farmers will particularly benefit from the increase in the flat rate VAT addition. The rate has been increased from 4% to 4.2% with effect from 1 March 2000. This will be worth £3.6 million in 2000 and £5.3 million in a full year. Agri-business will benefit from the general reduction in corporation tax. As regards environmental matters, it will benefit from the increase from £30,000 to £40,000 for pollution control measures. On longer term taxation issues, I recently introduced significant changes in the milk quota regime and experts from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of Finance will examine the tax implications. I intend to ensure the measures are helpful to farming families.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the <Col N="433" /> impact of the new tax rules on farming couples where both partners work on the farm. This concern is misplaced and I hope that will be clarified by farming organisations and others in the next few days. The position is that only those farmers with a family farm income of over £28,000, where the spouse does not work off the farm, will be affected. There is a relatively small number of farms in this position and where the spouse genuinely works on the farm, they will be entitled to the wider £34,000 standard rate band, the same as private businesses, publicans, etc. Spokespersons for the farming industry are raising concerns unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Social welfare increases of almost £400 million will be helpful to farmers, especially the schemes helping rural areas, including the farm assist. Other rural groups at risk of poverty include the elderly and those with young children. The elderly will benefit from increases in the old age pension, improvements in the carer's allowance and increased medical card eligibility. Parents will benefit from increases in child benefit and a significant child care package.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the range of policies which I outlined, including the very positive result of Agenda 2000, the strategies set out in the White Paper on Rural Development, the significant funding for agriculture, food and rural development in the National Development Plan together with the expenditure and tax concessions in yesterday's budget will provide a sound foundation for the development of the agri-food sector into the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this budget. I was interested in the Minister's remarks on farm families. I presumed the socially discriminatory changes as regards housewives would impact on spouses of farmers who work on the farm. However, the Minister said the farm will be regarded as a business and those measures will not affect them. I will wait and see what happens. Like many of my colleagues, I participated in radio programmes on the budget today. They focused on the social discrimination against housewives in the budget. I received an e-mail this morning which encapsulates the response to the budget:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled that the Government has initiated a three year programme which discriminates against women working in the home. I am the earner of a one-earner family and my family have grown up. I have no problem with increasing the children's allowance or any assistance the Government wants to give to families where the mother is forced or wishes to work. I have no problem with capital assistance towards crèches to provide extra <Col N="434" /> child care facilities. I would gladly forsake any improvement in my tax situation if improvements in those areas needed to be addressed. I am amazed that Charlie McCreevy has gone down this path and even more amazed that Bertie Ahern has sanctioned it.</P>
    <P>It continues in stronger terms. The budget was heralded as the biggest giveaway in years. We heard it would give away £6 billion, that it would be a tax bonanza and a dream budget for the Minister for Finance. However, it was unsatisfactory. The Minister's first budget discriminated against the lower paid, which he tried to redress in his second budget. This third budget will impact more on middle income earners &ndash; although there is nothing wrong with that &ndash; and the well off.</P>
    <P>All today's newspapers have highlighted the tax brackets of £30,000 or £35,000 for single earners and double income couples. The figures speak for themselves. There is a difference between those and the discriminatory measures implemented in order to introduce what was described by the Minister as individualised tax assessment. The Minister is taking a dangerous route in the next three years. Many Fianna Fáil backbenchers last night told me of their concerns about the Government's approach. One of the founding tenets of Fianna Fáil was its pro-family stance. It did not demonstrate that in this budget but instead has shown it is anti-family. This theme will be returned to. The Minister and the Taoiseach are probably already hearing backbenchers' concerns about the approach they are taking. I would not be surprised if the situation is redressed in the next budget and the Minister decides not to pursue this course in the next three years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions made for intellectual disability, although they did not go far enough. About 3,300 mentally handicapped people are seeking respite or residential places. It would have resolved many of these difficulties if the Minister had earmarked £78 million to £80 million in the budget. I wonder about the social conscience of the Government. Given the amount of money the Minister had, this was an excellent chance to address the problem. Admittedly, the extra £28 million will help create extra residential places and respite care next year. The Minister has projected expenditure of another £40 million in 2001 and £10 million in 2002. Over three years, he hopes to address the provision of residential places and respite care.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £28 million although I would have liked the Minister to have gone further. However, we must be thankful for small mercies. The budget also caters for people with physical and sensory difficulties but the Minister had an excellent opportunity to send a positive signal to the mentally handicapped. We all hear heart rending stories from parents who are trying to look after their children and cannot get residential places or respite care. Often a much older person is looking after an elderly per<Col N="435" /> son who should be in full-time residential care. This issue should have been addressed.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the fuel allowance remains at £5, yet the £5 travel tax has been abolished. Many of those who receive the fuel allowance do not get a chance to travel. The airline companies may have put pressure on the Minister to remove this tax. He said an increase in travel tax would probably have been objected to in the European Court. However, it is regrettable the fuel allowance was not increased given that it has remained the same for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Under the budget proposals, the allowance for a widow under the age of 65 with four children will increase from £145 to £149, an increase of £4. This works out at approximately 26p per day. Given the increase in the cost of a packet of cigarettes, if she buys ten cigarettes her allowance will diminish in one week. An increase of £4 is derisory. Recently, people received a reduced widow's pension as a result of receiving a UK pension and the difference between the IR£1 and the £1 sterling. Social welfare officers assessed 850 people and reduced their allowance by £24 or £25. This was mean minded of the Department. Some widows were extremely distressed by this. I know the Department will say that the allowance is means tested but many of these widows said that no one assessed them when the IR£1 was stronger than the £1 sterling and the differential was in the other direction. It is not the fault of these people if there is such a difference between the currencies. Reducing these payments was a punitive measure.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 50p increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes, we are all aware of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking. We all welcome the fact that the revenue of £132 million a year collected as a result of this measure will be directed to cardiovascular and cancer treatments. I am pleased the money has been ringfenced for use in this direction. We must not forget that cigarette sales raise in the region of £800 million for the State. Approximately three-quarters of the price of a packet of cigarettes is taken by the State in taxation. It is important to ringfence the extra money collected as a result of the 50p increase because our cancer treatment policy is lagging behind and needs a large injection of cash.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the marine industry which is my brief. There was so little in the budget for this industry that I backed away from commenting to the newspapers. If one looks at the marine sector, the national development plan and the regions which received Objective One status, it is obvious that young people are leaving peripheral rural communities along our coastline. Young people are drifting to better paid jobs in urban areas. There is now a problem finding people to work on fishing vessels. The Minister recently set up a task force to deal with seafarer training. There will be a decline in the numbers of young people working in the fishing industry unless they are <Col N="436" /> given some incentives. Consideration should have been given in the budget to proposals the Minister received from one of the fishermen's organisations, which has a great deal of merit. At present someone working on a seagoing ship and at sea for at least 169 days receives £5,000 seafarers allowance. There would be some merit in extending this to the trawlers and fishing communities. The Department could accumulate sufficient evidence to make their calculations because these men would have to reveal log books and quantify the number of days spent at sea. Another option would be to credit people for the number of days spent at sea. I will seek concessions in this regard during the debate on the Finance Bill. If there are no concessions in this area the decline in the fishing industry will be accelerated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the area of apprenticeship training and other training skills. I believe the Minister referred to an employers' levy of 0.7% generating approximately £120 million per year. This could be directed into retraining and the skills programme. The FÁS-type levy scheme is due to cease next year. This was a carrot and stick type of approach whereby one paid the levy and received grants for various forms of training, including apprenticeship training. I worked with AnCO in the past and I am aware the levy grant scheme has been in existence for a long time. The mechanism being introduced by the Minister will probably be a similar to what operated in the past.</P>
    <P>In relation to the domiciliary care allowance, I welcome the fact that the anomaly in relation to children under two years of age is being removed. This was an anomaly whereby one had to prove eligibility for domiciliary care on the basis of defined medical criteria and one had to be more than two years of age before this could be clarified. Often the medical condition of a young child was known before the age of two. I ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to consider the anomaly in this area. People who were recently eligible for domiciliary care allowance are now eligible for carer's allowance. A carer of a child eligible for the domiciliary care allowance is entitled to free travel. However, as a result of the child's medical condition, he or she is not entitled to free travel with the carer or parent. This is a silly anomaly in the system which was recently brought to my attention by a woman who finds herself in this situation.</P>
    <P>There is very little in the budget for farmers. It is disappointing that only £3.8 million has been earmarked for the farming community. However, I welcome the continuation of incentives for the control of farmyard pollution over the next three years. It is important to continue this scheme because the quality of our water is of great importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third time in the life of this Government the Minister for Finance has failed to use the unprecedented <Col N="437" /> resources at his disposal to fight inequality and poverty in society. Instead this budget deepens the divisions between rich and poor at a time when, with the peace process having made such progress, we should be moving towards the creation of real equality and social justice. This has been the most divisive budget in years. The wealthy have been rewarded once more. The higher paid have benefited disproportionately from the tax changes. The lower paid and those dependent on social welfare have been left with the crumbs from the table. They may well be bigger crumbs but they are still crumbs. The disadvantaged are not welcome at Deputy McCreevy's millennium banquet for the better off. To use a term close to the Minister's heart, they are not at the races.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance informed us that he was setting a new vision and a new strategy for the future. The measures he announced yesterday certainly belie that claim. Given the size of the massive budget surplus in his coffers, there was a distinct lack of vision and a lack of strategy to use that wealth to build a more equitable society. The budget is undoubtedly a bitter disappointment to those who believed the Government would use the opportunity it presented to create fundamental and lasting change and move from inequality to equality in society.</P>
      <P>This was the call Sinn Féin made in its pre-budget submission. We pointed out that we have an economy which is warped by structural inequalities. The improved conditions for many sections of our society and the conspicuous luxury enjoyed by a minority contrasts sharply with the plight of those who have not been allowed to benefit. The Minister for Finance has created more space for luxury and left the disadvantaged with an insulting pittance. We urged the Government to shift its policy from merely modifying the excesses of the market to becoming the main driving force leading to a new society on our island. This budget moves in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>The centrepiece of the Minister's budget is his claim to be the most radical tax reformer of all time. I acknowledge that there are some welcome moves to reform the system, but the thrust of the tax changes are to give the bulk of the benefits to the better off. As stated in its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin believes that the vast majority of citizens are glad to see their taxes used for progressive public spending, improving services for all and assisting the least well off. We refused to join the simplistic chorus which calls for giveaway tax cuts and which thereby spurns the opportunity offered by the current economic climate to make real social progress. What we need is taxation justice, not simple taxation reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the Minister for Finance given us? Instead of the scales of justice, we have the scales on the eyes of a Minister and a Government who wilfully ignore low pay poverty and unashamedly reward the wealthy who least need relief in the tax system. The simple statistic tells the tale. A <Col N="438" /> single PAYE worker on £14,000 per annum will be better off by £5 a week, while a single worker on £50,000 will be better off by £32 per week. That is a stark and clear indication of the nature of this budget.</P>
    <P>There is outrage throughout this country today at the blatant discrimination in the budget against parents, primarily women but increasingly men, who choose to care for their children in the home. Like other Deputies, I have received representations this morning from outraged citizens from different parts of this State. A couple in Dublin sent me a copy &ndash; I presume it was received by other Deputies &ndash; of their open letter to the Minister in which they state &ldquo;You are now telling me that my wife is a non-productive person in our society until she goes out to work and that you intend to penalise us for minding our children at home.&rdquo; Those sentiments are being echoed throughout the length and breadth of this land.</P>
    <P>These disastrous measures will undoubtedly deepen the child care crisis. In its budget submission, Sinn Féin stated that we need to put children back at the centre of the child care debate. The priority of all must be the provision of the best care at all times for all children. That includes care by parents in the home, care by other family members, paid care by child care workers in the home, early childhood education, cre±ches and other facilities provided by the community or voluntary sector or by private concerns.</P>
    <P>The first choice of most couples remains to give their children the best care possible and that is full-time care by a parent or parents in the home. The budget is an insult to them and, on this issue alone, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will pay a heavy political price and rightly so. Perhaps they should pay that price now.</P>
    <P>While the funds to increase child care places are welcome, a key measure needed &ndash; a really substantial increase in child benefit &ndash; has not happened. An increase of at least £20 per child per month, as sought by Sinn Féin in its pre-budget submission, would have provided a worthwhile level of assistance to parents struggling to meet their child care needs. Having made much of bringing social welfare increases forward to May 2000, it is disgraceful that child benefit increases will not come into effect until September 2000. The increase is less than 26p per day per child and people must wait until just before the next budget to see it.</P>
    <P>The Minister cited the national anti-poverty strategy in relation to his social welfare increases. The NAPS says that welfare &ldquo;must provide sufficient income for all those concerned to move out of poverty and to live in a manner compatible with human dignity&rdquo;. The budget once again fails to meet this criterion. A budget of vision would have linked welfare payments to average incomes. Sinn Féin was among those who argued that social welfare payments should be set at 50% of average incomes. The £4 per week increases are, therefore, totally inadequate and insulting, given the massive resources available. The allo<Col N="439" /> cation of £4 per week for welfare recipients and £5 per week for low paid workers, while capital gains tax and corporation tax are slashed to benefit the most prosperous in this society, is a travesty of justice.</P>
    <P>One of the most glaring omissions in this budget is its failure to address the housing crisis. There are not any imaginative tax measures to free up housing, such as the capital gains tax increases proposed by Sinn Féin to curb property speculation. Instead we have the continuation of piecemeal measures with local authorities starved of the funding to accommodate people on our massive waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The budget is very disappointing for people with disabilities. A paltry £5.35 million is included under the heading of social inclusion. The welcome funding of the Vantastic service in Dublin underlines the lack of such provision elsewhere. There is nothing whatever towards the provision of personal assistants for people with disabilities. A budget of vision would have established an independent living fund. I have, with colleagues, contacted Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox, Gildea and Blaney on this issue and I will watch with interest their reaction to the absence of this and many other necessary measures from the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to provide the necessary substantial increase in the carer's allowance and the new measures announced offer meagre redress. Those who provide full-time care have not been shown the real appreciation that is their due. Once again, and at a time when no excuses can be made, a Minister for Finance has failed to take any appreciable step towards balancing the books between carer and State. The State is heavily in the debt of carers who daily relieve this exchequer of much of its responsibilities towards our aged and infirm citizens. The Minister's thanks are not enough. Carers deserve and must expect proper recognition for the not just important but essential role they play.</P>
    <P>There is little in the budget to benefit the most hard pressed in the farming sector. I point in particular to the failure to provide any special measure to assist pig producers in the Border region. Unless immediate action is taken, many more of them will be driven from the industry altogether. In his 11 page address to the House this afternoon, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development failed to mention the plight of the Border pig farmers.</P>
    <P>His colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in response to questions from me and other Members would not indicate how much membership of NATO's Partnership for Peace will cost the taxpayer. We got the first taste of this in the budget with £1.5 million in PfP entry costs, a sum that could and should be spent on any number of necessary measures. We await with interest the magnification of this sum in coming budgets, a burden imposed on taxpayers who were denied by the Government their right to decide on membership of PfP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> In conclusion, I approached the budget, as I indicated to the Minister in my covering text to our pre-budget submission, with an open mind and a real expectation that the deep deficiencies in the last two budgets &ndash; certainly very much in evidence in the first presentation &ndash; would be rectified on this occasion. I was deeply disappointed and, therefore, regrettably I must record my opposition to what I can only describe as a &ldquo;budget for inequality&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Work&rdquo; is the word which expresses the theme and character of the budget. Yesterday afternoon the Minister for Finance announced a working budget for an economy that works. Furthermore, this year's budget and the Minister's two previous ones have dealt decisively and effectively with one of the most frustrating problems that has dogged the economy for many years &ndash; the unsustainable burden of taxation through which the Exchequer carried out as a matter of course each week a smash and grab raid on every worker's pay packet.</P>
      <P>The single greatest anomaly of our taxation system over the years has been that our average industrial wage is subject to the top rate of taxation. For years workers have endured a situation in which they moved on to the higher rate of tax at an absurdly low threshold. On paper an individual might appear to have a reasonably decent wage but in reality his or her take home pay was an emaciated skeleton of the perceived wage. By widening the band for a single person to £17,000 per annum this year the Minister is moving towards a position where only 17% of taxpayers will be subject to the top rate of tax. This has a vital bearing on the whole concept of national wage negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is creating an environment in which these negotiations will be about real money and unions will know that the result of their bargaining will make a real difference to their members' pay packets. The social partnership model, in conjunction with a succession of national agreements, has been the cornerstone of the prosperity Ireland enjoys today. That system is envied even among many of our fellow members of the European Union. It has proved to be an essential recipe for economic progress. The budget ensures that we can continue on that path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our adversarial parliamentary system it is, unfortunately, inevitable that the budget will be criticised &ndash; that is the nature of the game. However, the Opposition critics are well aware that it is impossible to solve all economic and social problems in one budget. The most pressing <Col N="441" /> and outstanding difficulties must be identified and then one adopts the &ldquo;bulls eye&rdquo; principle and targets them, choosing a particular problem and making that the immediate priority. That has been done in the budget and that is why the Minister for Finance is focusing so much effort on such a determined and radical overhaul of the tax system.</P>

      <P>I admire their nerve. It takes a hard neck for people who almost marched the country over the precipice of bankruptcy in the mid 1980s to lecture us about good Government.

      <P>It is amusing to listen to lectures from proven non-achievers. However, while choosing tax reform as his prime target the Minister has, in line with Fianna Fáil tradition, given old age pensioners a substantial rise of £7 a week. Indeed, the budget asserts the Government's continuing commitment to social inclusion with the biggest social welfare package in history.</P>
      <P>Before turning to my own immediate concerns regarding tourism and sport, I applaud one highly significant development which was signalled in the budget &ndash; decentralisation. The principle of decentralisation was an enlightened initiative introduced by Fianna Fáil in the 1980s, which was put on the back burner by our opponents when they came into office. Yet, the arrival of sections of Government Departments into numerous urban centres brought new life into those communities. I am glad that this concept is to be revived. It will take some of the pressure off our congested capital city and bring a new vitality to other towns along with the opportunity of a better lifestyle for the personnel involved. In my native county, Donegal, one can enjoy a higher standard of living and an improved quality of life, even more so following the historic events of this week. One could buy a mansion in Donegal for what one would pay for a matchbox in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past ten years, Ireland has climbed to the top of the international tourism performance league with the number of visitors and, more importantly, foreign revenue earnings from tour<Col N="442" /> ism increasing annually. In 1999, this trend continued and tourism is poised to become Ireland's largest industry. All the indications are that our 1999 growth targets of 7% in visitor numbers and 9% in total foreign revenue will be achieved. A significant feature of our tourism marketing and promotion efforts in recent years has been our success in attracting a number of major international sporting events to Ireland. Events such as the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race, the Tour de France and numerous golfing tournaments have successfully attracted enormous international publicity, while enhancing our status and reputation as a world class destination. Similarly, future events already secured, such as the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003 and the Ryder Cup in 2005, will ensure that invaluable media attention will remain firmly focused on Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I asked Bord Fáilte to consider the establishment of a dedicated unit with the specific task of exploring opportunities to promote Ireland as a venue for international sporting events and to develop strategies for attracting them here. The budget provided for £2.5 million to be allocated annually over the next three years to support efforts to attract major sporting events with tourism potential to Ireland and will allow such strategies to be put in place. I intend that my Department and Bord Fáilte will work out the final details over the coming weeks with a view to putting in action this exciting new area as early as possible in the New Year. It offers exciting opportunities for the future and will allow us to exploit a great new potential for increasing tourism earnings.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, one of the Government's top priorities has been to ensure that a significant fund would be put in place for marketing Ireland overseas as a top tourist destination in the new millennium. This objective has now been achieved with the provision made in the national development plan for Ireland's first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund. The main purpose of the fund, which has been allocated £150 million over the period 2000 to 2006, or £20 million per year, is to finance the promotion and marketing internationally of Ireland as a world class tourist location and the specific marketing of activity based holidays with a view to regional development.</P>
    <P>One of the major and immediate outcomes of the legislation passed this year was the establishment of the Sports Council. Ireland now has, again for the first time, a national programme to combat doping in sport. The first test was carried out on 21 November 1999. Only 15% or 30 of the 200 countries who compete in international sports have their own national anti-doping programme and Ireland is now in that group.</P>
    <P>Allocations of more than £18 million have been made in 1999 to some 400 local community based projects and to a number of national and regional projects throughout the country. Fingal County <Col N="443" /> Council recently completed a feasibility study on the provision of an indoor athletics training facility adjacent to the existing athletics facility at Morton Stadium, which is prioritised in the recently published review of the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, financial assistance amounting to £85 million will be available over the seven years of the plan to support the development of sport and recreational facilities by local authorities, particularly in areas which lack them. Under schemes now operating under the Sports Council, the national governing bodies of the Olympic sports were allocated £2.5 million towards their activities this year. A further £1 million has been allocated to their elite athletes and players under the international carding scheme which comprises individual grants as well as access to medical support, sports science services and career counselling.</P>
    <P>I was delighted yesterday with the announcement by the Minister for Finance that an additional £1 million has been made available in this year's budget to the Sports Council towards the costs associated with the preparation and participation of the Irish Olympic and Paralympic teams in the 2000 Sydney games. In view of this substantial investment by the Government in Olympic sports and across the whole spectrum of sport and the special place of sport in Irish life, I am grievously disappointed once again to hear of another unseemly public disagreement involving the Olympic Council of Ireland and Irish athletics. The Sports Council is endeavouring to assist in reaching a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Is it not time these difficulties were sorted out in a reasonable and constructive way? All concerned should face up to their responsibilities in the interest of sport. The energies of sports administrators would be better utilised in attempting to ensure Ireland's success at the Olympic Games, which is what every Irish person longs for. On the issue which is the cause of the current dispute, it was at my instigation and following many years of consultations between the athletics bodies that the new Athletics Association of Ireland was formed. We brought the two athletics bodies together, although some commentators said it would be impossible. BLE and NACA have come together and athletics and athletes can only benefit as a result. In this context, it is a source of surprise to me that what is a major step forward for Irish athletics would appear to create difficulties for the Olympic Council if allowed. Let commonsense prevail so that this dispute can be settled now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally recognised by the medical profession that influenza can have a serious and sometimes fatal effect on vulnerable <Col N="444" /> groups, particularly the elderly. A decision was made a number of years ago to issue a free 'flu vaccine to general practitioners which could be administered to GMS patients. There was some controversy earlier this year about whether the scheme would continue after the doctors' organisation said they would have difficulty continuing it unless it was put on a particular footing.</P>
      <P>I received an inquiry some time ago from an elderly gentleman about this matter. He and his wife are in bad health; she is regularly admitted to hospital. He contacted me to tell me that when he went to get the flu vaccine, he was informed by his GP that it would not be administered unless he paid £15. This was in spite of the fact that the man and his wife are elderly and have medical cards.</P>
      <P>I subsequently wrote to the Minister for Health and Children, asking him for the up to date position regarding the scheme, and I was informed by letter some time later that agreement had been reached between the Irish Medical Organisation and the Department of Health and Children and the 'flu vaccine would be administered to all GMS patients free of charge. I was delighted to receive the reply and I forwarded it to my constituent. He then made another trip to his GP only to be told that he would not be given the flu vaccine unless he paid £15. The elderly gentleman telephoned me and said he had received my reply, but it was incorrect. His GP told him it was not free and that he would be charged £15.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clarify the matter, I telephoned the GP concerned. In fairness to him, he was not trying to rip off patients or claim an additional fee for services. The opposite was the case. In a conversation with me, he told me that as a matter of principle he would not administer the scheme. I have a copy of a letter the GP, Dr. Leonard Condren who practises in Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, submitted to <i>Forum</i>, which I understand is the magazine for general practitioners. It states:</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the current debacle regarding influenza vaccination. As a matter of principle I am returning my free supply of vaccines to the Eastern Health Board and will purchase replacement stock from an appropriate supplier.</P>
      <P>I intend to administer the vaccine to all my at risk patients who present for it. A discounted inclusive fee will be equally applied to GMS and private patients. Those GMS patients unable to afford the fee will be advised to immediately attend the surgery for a prescription of Relenza should they develop symptoms of influenza.</P>
      <P>This policy will ensure that inability to pay will not block my patients from receiving the care they are entitled to. It also ensures that I am not compromised by using vaccine stocks from a health board which is not committed to prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> From my conversation with Dr. Condren, I understand he is one of only a few doctors in my constituency who are not participating in the scheme. If there are others, I am not aware of them. I am concerned that action by an individual doctor or a number of GPs would leave patients, and particularly elderly people, at risk during the winter of contracting influenza with all its associated risks and problems.</P>
    <P>The GP concerned told me that, as far as he is concerned, a proper structure has not been put in place to administer the scheme and there is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement whereby GPs will give the flu vaccination to patients for an out of hours fee. He believes the scheme is not being administered correctly and he will not participate in it. In the meantime my constituents are at risk and I want the Minister to tell me if the Department and GPs in the GMS have agreed a scheme. In the meantime my constituents are at risk. I want the Minister to let me know if there is an agreed scheme between the Department and the general practitioners in the GMS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGennis for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like first to set out the general background to this issue. Each year the health boards purchase a quantity of influenza vaccine for provision to at-risk persons in the GMS population. In 1998 the quantity purchased was increased by 50% to approximately 300,000 doses, and a similar quantity has been purchased this year. The at-risk group includes all persons over 65.</P>
      <P>This vaccine has for many years been given to GMS patients by their general practitioners as part of the service covered by the capitation payment they receive for medical card patients. However, this year the Irish Medical Organisation sought a specific payment for providing the vaccine to GMS patients. The health boards' position is that they are not agreeable to a charge for a service which was previously provided without charge.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the issue have been held at the Health Service Employers' Agency. At a meeting on 7 October the Health Service Employers' Agency, recognising that there are issues between the parties regarding administration of the influenza vaccine, and in order to resolve this dispute without delay, proposed that the issues be referred to an independent third party for adjudication. This would have included consideration of the question of whether GPs should receive a separate payment for giving the flu vaccine. However, this offer was declined by the Irish Medical Organisation. Subsequently, the IMO advised its members to ensure that all at-risk medical card holders were vaccinated free of charge and the Minister and I welcome the fact that, notwithstanding the dispute regarding its administration, medical card holders have therefore been able to receive the influenza vaccine as in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> In relation to the particular case cited by the Deputy, the Department has been informed by the Eastern Health Board that a general practitioner returned to the board the stocks of influenza vaccine supplied to him. The board understood that the doctor in question proposed to obtain future supplies of the vaccine from the pharmacist.</P>
    <P>The Minister remains hopeful that it will be possible to reach agreement on this issue and that the Irish Medical Organisation will reconsider the offer made by the health service employers of referral of the issue in dispute to an independent third party.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has said, there are a number of issues here. Most general practitioners have given the vaccine and are awaiting an outcome on the arbitration. Unfortunately that has not taken place yet. Other doctors gave the vaccine on the basis of after hours service or fee per item of service. That is how things stand at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have called this debate because I wish to clarify what is the state of play with regard to providing a residential drug addiction treatment service in the Cork area for adolescents. Twelve months ago I made my first contribution to a debate in this House on this very subject. I thought at the time, in my innocence, that I and others were being successful in putting pressure on the Minister to provide funding in this area. Over the past year a number of promises and announcements have been made indicating that funding for adolescent drug treatment residential care would be provided, by supporting a programme run by Matt Talbot Services in Cork. However, no funding has yet appeared.</P>
      <P>The Minister is more than aware of the battle against drug addiction that we face, particularly in the case of young people.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this fight. The first is to try to cut off supply by tackling drug traffickers and dealers, with which we have had some success. The second is to try to encourage people to move away from drug use, whether they be addicts or simply youngsters experimenting.</P>
      <P>Treatment of young addicts is an area that has been neglected desperately. We have an intolerable situation in Cork at present where a residential drug treatment programme that has been recognised as a success, has been closed for nearly two years, due to lack of funding. Let me remind the Minister how the programme works. Three centres in County Cork make up a model of treatment that is appropriate to address the needs of young drug abusers. The first is Garryvoe in east Cork, which is phase 1 of the programme. It is a ten bed residential facility that deals with children immediately after they have been taken off harmful drugs. Garryvoe also deals with trying to re-educate children. This building is now closed awaiting funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is Ahiohill in west Cork which is <Col N="447" /> phase 2 of the programme. It takes adolescents who have been weaned off a drug and prepares them for the outside world again, prepares them for getting a job and a career, and gives them a direction. Again, this building is closed, awaiting promised funding.</P>
    <P>The third centre is Trabeg, Douglas in Cork which is the final phase 3 of the programme. This is an eight bed facility, but it also has offices and day care facilities which monitor and support children and young adults as they re-enter society and develop a decent life without the effects of drugs and crime. This building and phase 3 is only partially open, again waiting for promised funding.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this model of treatment is a proven success that allows children who desperately need it to be taken out of the surroundings that led them astray. It builds up and educates children on how to re-enter society in a positive way, and it helps to maintain and support adolescents when they have re-entered society and are trying to cope.</P>
    <P>I assume I do not have to spend time in this debate trying to convince the Minister of the need for residential drug treatment facilities for adolescents. Everyone accepts, and we have studies to prove it, that drug use is on the increase among young people.</P>
    <P>During the summer, I got a letter from Matt Talbot Services thanking me for my contribution in securing the funding they required to re-open their services. Everybody involved in drug treatment and prevention that I know in Cork was pleased to hear that Matt Talbot Services would be re-opened &ndash; the Garda, addicts, local councillors, the Southern Health Board, and any drug counsellors to whom I spoke. Apparently everything was in place until the funding was looked for. A sum of £250,000 was to come from the Department of Health and Children through the Southern Health Board; £250,000 was to come from the Department of Education and Science, as promised and £250,000 was to be made available by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That commitment took a bit longer to get, but we got it also.</P>
    <P>The question I want answered is simple, and I want a straight answer because we are dealing with young people's lives here, and promises that have already been made. Is the funding available as promised? If so, when will we see it put into action?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I missed something in the budget documentation, but I have seen no reference to funding for Matt Talbot Services. Adolescent children who need it should not have to wait any longer for residential drug treatment. There is nowhere for them to receive treatment at present in the south. As a result they have to travel long distances, sometimes even abroad, for treatment, or they receive no treatment. I cannot accept this at a time when our Government has so much money at its disposal, particularly when the facili<Col N="448" /> ties and expertise are already in place in Cork, but closed because of lack of funding that was promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for raising this very important matter. As the Deputy will be aware, the Southern Health Board has statutory responsibility for the provision of alcohol and drug treatment services for adolescents in its area. The board provides a range of services, mainly through its out-patient facility at Arbour House in Cork and its outreach and counselling services throughout Cork and Kerry. The board also has an arrangement whereby it refers adolescents to Aislinn Treatment Centre in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, for the treatment of substance misuse.</P>
      <P>Matt Talbot Adolescent Services provides residential treatment for male adolescents. In this regard I would point out that the Southern Health Board is agreeable in principle to the provision of funding to the Matt Talbot Services in respect of the services to be provided there. Matt Talbot Services has been allocated £30,000 by the board in 1999 to assist with the development of its services. In addition, it has been allocated the sum of £50,000 from the youth services development fund, under the aegis of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation towards the work of Matt Talbot Services whenever services commence there.</P>
      <P>The services available at Matt Talbot, however, cover a number of areas as well as alcohol and drug misuse. These include child care areas such as services for early school leavers and justice and probation services and consequently the proposal falls into the remit of a number of agencies and Departments. These key agencies and Departments are working to agree on a level of service which is appropriate for Matt Talbot Adolescent Services and this, in turn, would have an impact on the level of funding required.</P>
      <P>I understand that discussions are in progress between the agencies involved in an effort to advance the situation. A meeting has been arranged for next week between officials of my Department, officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and officials from the Department of Education and Science, together with other agencies involved such as the Southern Health Board and Cork VEC, to discuss the issue of services and funding.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these discussions will be concluded at an early date and that they will culminate in agreement on the level of services and funding to be provided at Matt Talbot Adolescent Services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Social inclusion is the buzz word used by all Ministers and the Minister for Finance was no exception as he read the Budget Statement yesterday. I raise the issue of Charleville <Col N="449" /> Community Care and Garden Services. This organisation's request for funding which would facilitate social inclusion has been refused and their project is in danger of lapsing because of the failure of the Department to provide the necessary funding.</P>
      <P>Charleville Community Care and Garden Services Ltd. is a limited company with charitable status whose main objective is family support for persons requiring rehabilitiation with ongoing counselling and personal development. The people in question are recovering from alcoholism, from various addictions, from social and psychological insecurities and other disabilities. To ensure a safe environment for them the Charleville community care committee with some support from FÁS built workshops, tunnels and a marketing area so that the work they are involved in would be socially meaningful and productive for them and their families. They employ two section managers to run the business and they, in turn, must generate their own salaries from sales.</P>
      <P>The company fundraises significantly locally, which because of its good work it does very successfully. Current outgoings are approximately £50,000 and the company receives sigificant funding from the local credit union. They urgently need funding to pay the necessary bills arising from the establishment of the workshops, the purchase of essential equipment and ongoing counselling which is provided for those suffering from alcoholism, other addictions and various psychological problems.</P>
      <P>I fail to comprehend how any Government would answer such a needy cause with a negative response. It is scandalous that an affluent economy would disregard the weakest &ndash; the socially and mentally frail. These people cannot cope with open pressurised work systems. Charleville care services labours night and day to keep the service afloat and rejection has been the response from Government. This is not just treatment when the Exchequer is awash with money. These people employed by the company have gifts, needs and talents and deserve social inclusion and the right to participate in meaningful sheltered work rather than be subjected to the public house, betting offices or pawn shops.</P>
      <P>This is a real test of the Government's commitment to social inclusion. Neither the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the health board nor any other arm of the State could carry out the sort of voluntary work which is being done throughout the country by organisations similar to Charleville Community Care. For the little money the organisation requests we would get a return which is multiplied in value many times. No State authority could either carry out or buy such service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The request for funding and the uncertainty which follows its refusal has been going on far too long. The lack of recognition by the Department of the work being done is very disheartening for the people involved and is a serious threat to the service they provide to the weakest section of our <Col N="450" /> society. The amount of money required is about £35,000. This is very little and I hope the Minister will announce funding for this project this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for raising this issue. Tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion are the cornerstones of the Government's economic and social policies. Building an inclusive society is one of the seven key concerns of the Government's action programme. Social exclusion involves a lack of resources but it goes beyond that. People who are socially excluded are not only deprived of a reasonable quality of life, they are also deprived of a significant influence in controlling the processes that give rise to these inequalities.</P>
      <P>The Government's social inclusion strategy entails more than simply providing resources for disadvantaged groups. It has ensured that disadvantaged people can participate more effectively in all aspects of life. It is important that sufficient resources are put in place to support and develop the inherent capacities of communities to realise their own unique potential. My Department supports local self-help and community development initiatives. This support is made available through a range of grant schemes and core funding under both the family and community services resource centre programme and the community development programme.</P>
      <P>The community development programme (CDP) was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage. The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having strategic importance. At present there are 130 projects participating in the programme or in the process of being set up.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the valuable work being done by community development projects on the ground. Support for community development continues to be an integral part of the Government's overall social and economic development strategy. Community development is the means by which the capacity of disadvantaged local communities to participate in mainstream development is increased. In recognition of the importance of this work, in this year's budget package I have provided an additional £1.268 million towards community initiatives. I hope Opposition Deputies will at least welcome that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The community development programme is a part of the overall framework of support for community development and family support groups provided by my Department. Sup<Col N="451" /> port under these schemes ranges from small once-off grants to three-year renewable funding commitments under three main community development support programmes. The aim of a family and community services resource centre is to help to combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families. In this year's budget I secured an additional £5 million for community based groups to develop community out-of-school child care services.</P>
      <P>My Department received an application under the 1999 scheme of grants to voluntary organisations from Charleville Community Care and Garden Services Ltd. seeking funding of £25,000 towards the cost of equipment required to set up sheltered work training and experience services for unemployed men recovering from mental illnesses or having borderline social skills. The application was examined at both regional and central level but was found not to come within the scope of the Department's grant schemes. The funding of projects of this nature is primarily the responsibility of the local health board and FÁS. I understand that both the Southern Health Board and FÁS have provided financial support in this case and that a community employment scheme is in operation in Charleville Community Care and Garden Services. Grants are not generally made available from my Department in respect of services which are the responsibility of other statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The target group may be eligible for assistance towards the cost of pre-employment training under my Department's employment support services scheme. I have asked my officials to contact Charleville Community Care and Garden Services to establish if the work being carried out would be eligible for assistance under the ESS scheme.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that many clients currently benefiting from the association with Charleville Community Care and Garden Services are also persons with broader family needs which are being addressed. Therefore, as I understand that the service includes provision of family and bereavement counselling, I am arranging to have the request for funding examined under my Department's scheme of grants for marriage, child and bereavement counselling services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for making representations in this case. I have received representations from many people, including the Taoiseach and the Deputy's two colleagues. Recently I spoke with Sr. Celestine about this matter and explained the difficulties in respect of the grant schemes. Perhaps under the employment support services scheme and the scheme of grants for marriage, child and bereavement counselling services &ndash; for which increased funding of £1.5 million has been <Col N="452" /> provided in the budget &ndash; the Charleville scheme might be eligible for assistance. I suggest the Deputy continue to lobby the Southern Health Board in respect of funding for the scheme.</P>

      <P>While the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs mentioned the additional funds needed to fund the previous project, the project which Deputy Penrose and I wish to speak on does not require funds. We would be pleased to get approval for a particular idea which has been put.</P>
      <P>Ballymore is a scenic village in the centre of County Westmeath. This village boasts a beautiful location on the shores of Lough Sunderlin and has the usual amenities of a church, school, a thriving GAA club, a Garda station, an array of shops and pubs and a magnificent community centre. This community centre was built by the local community and is a credit to all concerned. The village has an active and enthusiastic tidy towns committee and the village continues to climb the competitive tidy towns league table.</P>
      <P>The one blot on the landscape in Ballymore is the Garda station and the adjoining Garda residence. Strategically situated across the road from the Church of the Holy Redeemer, it commands an important position in the village. This building is run down, shabby, has broken windows and the surrounds are overgrown. It surely must be an embarrassment for the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as for the taxpayer. It certainly is embarrassing to the local community in Ballymore that a publicly owned property, housing the local Garda station, should be so run down and dilapidated.</P>
      <P>A local builder submitted a proposal to the Garda authorities to take over the existing building and site and in return he would provide a new Garda station to the specification required by the Office of Public Works, with no cost to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While I am not privy to the small print of this proposal, nonetheless it seems a reasonable proposition. Unfortunately, this proposal has moved very slowly through the bureaucratic chain and a decision does not seem to be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Office of Public Works to review immediately the situation at Ballymore Garda station and either upgrade it and the adjoining <Col N="453" /> residence to a reasonable standard at public expense or consider the proposal put to it. It is a shame on the Office of Public Works that this building, which I believe is structurally sound, should remain almost derelict in this lovely village while so many people voluntarily strive to maintain the standards of the environment in this locality.</P>
    <P>As a native of Ballymore and since my late father was the local garda for 25 years, I am familiar with this building even though my family never resided there. It is a shame it should lie derelict when one notes the proposals put to the Department. I hope the Minister will take the matter on board and have it reviewed urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy McGrath, who is a native of Ballymore and whose late father was the local garda for a long time, for sharing his time with me. We are seeking a new Garda station at Ballymore, County Westmeath or the upgrading and refurbishing of the existing station. I avail of this opportunity to reflect the anger of the people of Ballymore and the surrounding areas at the failure to honour commitments to proceed with the much needed construction of a proper Garda station, which is essential for the convenience and comfort of all who work therein and for members of the public who rightly expect decent facilities to be provided when they have recourse to the local station for help and advice.</P>
      <P>The condition of the current station has sharply deteriorated. It is only a small box room, 19 feet by 12 feet, with a flat roof. It is situated at the rear of the two storey residence which has been unoccupied since 1983.</P>
      <P>The house itself is in poor condition with windows, doors, chimney etc. in a dilapidated condition. The condition of the station is also very unsatisfactory considering that two members have to work there. It is damp and dark, with the result that on the best days of summer the light has to be turned on. The size of the station is totally inadequate, with no room for basic necessities such as personal lockers. There is no room in which to cook. Why should members of the Garda have to work in such cramped conditions when the resources are bountiful and the Minister for Finance is in a position to bank almost £1.6 billion?</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is well aware of the conditions of the station. It agreed almost three years ago that a new building should be constructed on the site. As Deputy McGrath said, the people of Ballymore make a conscious effort at tidy towns level to effect continuous improvements and have made tremendous efforts in this regard. The current dilapidated date of the old Garda residence and the adjoining station has not been helpful to the strong co-ordinated efforts of all involved in the tidy town efforts and it is a shame that a State-owned building is hampering them in their worthy efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, Ballymore is No. 14 on the &ldquo;basic <Col N="454" /> unit&rdquo; list and it is a bone of contention that this station has slipped down the priority list. If the Minister does not have the money, both Deputy McGrath and myself have the solution. As I understand it, a local developer has offered to construct a new basic unit with all the necessary facilities on the site beside the station. This would obviously be subject to agreement between the Office of Public Works and other details to which I am not privy. Both the Minister's Department and the Office of Public Works are aware of this proposal. What is the reason for the delay? If the Minister is not happy with the proposal he should say so. Why not seek a better deal if that is the essence of the hold-up? Why not meet with the developer to thrash out the matter? Is not this the type of public private partnership the Government is supposed to be promoting?</P>
    <P>The people who live in the picturesque village of Ballymore have waited long enough and their patience is exhausted. Those who use the station and the gardaí who work there deserve proper facilities and the provision of a modern Garda station is fully warranted by any objective standard. We look forward to the Minister giving us good news on the matter this evening.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Ballymore Garda station, in the Longford-Westmeath Garda division, is a sub-district station with a party of two members of garda rank. While the premises is in a prominent location in the town and has all the facilities necessary for Garda requirements at this location, it is recognised, nevertheless, that the building itself and the associated official accommodation are in a less than optimal state of repair.</P>
      <P>This fact was confirmed by an inspection of the premises which was conducted by the Garda housing officer in January 1999. The condition of the Garda station and official accommodation is such that the refurbishment of the existing structure is not considered to be economically advantageous and would not constitute the best use of available resources.</P>
      <P>As a consequence and being mindful of his duty to ensure the most effective use of funds, the Minister is please to state that a new, purpose-built basic unit type Garda station is to be provided at Ballymore. This decision was made following a feasibility study conducted by the Office of Public Works, which confirmed that it is possible to develop a basic unit station on the grounds adjoining the existing station, with only comparatively minor works required to the sewerage system in consequence.</P>
      <P>When constructed, the new basic unit station will provide all the facilities necessary for the performance of Garda duties in the locality to a very high standard. In this regard, basic unit type accommodation is specifically designed to provide reception, public office, storage, radio equipment and toilet facilities for the station party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> In the interim, some required refurbishment of the existing Garda station was recently undertaken. Specifically, in September last, works were completed to various parts of the station, the entrance way to the station, a front window and the eaves around the entire building.</P>
    <P>With regard to progress on the more substantive matter of building a new station, it will be appreciated that all such major developments must proceed according to the priorities of the Garda building programme. This programme seeks to ensure the ordered, timely and economically efficient construction or major refurbishment of Garda stations, as policing requirements dictate and overall resources allow.</P>
    <P>There are a number of building projects which require attention before work may proceed at Ballymore. I cannot, therefore, indicate when precisely construction work will commence. However, the Minister assures the House he is determined to see the project proceed and there will be no avoidable delay in providing new accommodation at this location. In this regard it is important to point out that the current stock of <Col N="456" /> Garda accommodation numbers 703 Garda stations, offices and complexes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of police services to the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. Consequently all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure that it meets the operational requirements of the Force. Where it does not, the necessary works will be prioritised and completed with alacrity. This year, for example, it is expected that approximately £3.5 million will be spent on maintenance work to Garda stations and £6.5 million has been provided in the current year in the Office of Public Works Vote for major new construction or refurbishment projects. I look forward to continuing progress with the Garda building programme and, as an element of this, anticipate the new Garda station will be provided at Ballymore, having regard to the overall priorities and availability of financial and other resources.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 December 1999.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, given by the EU General Affairs Council to debt relief for highly indebted poor countries.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25493/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1999, at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF, the EU Presidency said that the EU was prepared to use funds in the framework of the European Development Fund to make a substantial contribution towards relieving the debt burden on African, Caribbean and Pacific states. The presidency indicated that this initiative would include an EU contribution for debt cancellation of the order of one billion euros.</P>
      <P>In November 1999 the commission presented a proposal on the EU contribution to debt relief to the General Affairs Council. The principal elements in the proposal are a contribution of 320 million euros to help write off debt service obligations to the community of the ACP countries which qualify under the highly indebted poor countries initiative; a contribution of 626 million euros to the highly indebted poor countries trust fund managed by the World Bank. This will be earmarked for ACP countries.</P>
      <P>These contributions will come from unallocated resources in the European development fund. The African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, for whose benefit the EDF was established, have agreed to the use of the unallocated funds for debt relief.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above contributions, the EU will also separately allocate 54 million euros to the heavily indebted poor countries trust fund which will be unearmarked and can be used for debt relief for non ACP countries.</P>
      <P>At the request of the ACP countries, the commission has also proposed using 250 million euros to assist structural adjustment in ACP countries who wish to qualify for debt relief. Taken together, all of these contributions amount to 1.25 billion euros &ndash; 1 billion in direct debt relief and 250 million euros in structural adjustment assistance.</P>
      <P>The commission proposal is at present under discussion in the Council framework. It is possible that the package will be agreed at the General Affairs Council on 6 December. It should then be presented to the next ACP-EU ministerial meeting on 7-8 December for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has strongly supported a generous EU contribution to debt relief. We have long argued that the financial resources available under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative were not sufficient to cut debt levels significantly. This proposed EU contribution gives the EU a leading role in the funding of debt relief which should <Col N="458" /> encourage other major donors to assume their fair share of the burden of financing debt relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is following the situation in East and West Timor closely. I am pleased to be able to report that the situation is stabilising and conditions are improving. Almost all the country has now been rendered secure by INTERFET with only the border areas remaining on high alert, particularly the south-west where the Irish Defence Forces contingent is operational.</P>
      <P>The deployment of INTERFET created the security conditions needed to allow the return to their homes of East Timorese displaced in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia, and within East Timor itself. While it is still proving difficult to get accurate figures on the numbers of displaced people, latest reports suggest that approximately 150,000 people are being accommodated in camps in West Timor. There is a steady flow of returns from the camps in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia and the UN reports that there has been a total of 107,700 returns to date. In addition those who had taken refuge in the territory's mountains and forests are now returning to their towns and villages.</P>
      <P>East Timor remains very much in the immediate post-emergency phase of the crisis and at present international efforts are focused on meeting basic needs. The main priority is shelter with the monsoon season about to start and 85,000 homes damaged or destroyed. The arrival of the monsoon season has also increased health risks and efforts are being made to rehabilitate hospitals and health centres throughout the region. The rains have also signalled the arrival of the planting season, which creates an urgent need for seeds. In the longer term, structures will have to be put in place in order to ensure as smooth a transition to the reconstruction phase as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to assisting in the humanitarian relief operation in both East and West Timor. We have approved a grant package of £1 million pounds to meet the humanitarian and rehabilitation needs of the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people. The assistance will meet immediate humanitarian needs such as food, water and medical supplies and will help with initial reconstruction. All assistance is being co-ordinated with other donors to ensure an efficient and effective response to those most in need. An initial allocation of £400,000 was made to UN agencies currently on the ground in the region. A further £250,000 was <Col N="459" /> allocated last week in response to the UN consolidated appeal.</P>
    <P>An assessment team from the Department of Foreign Affairs and APSO, has just returned from the region and further funding will be considered based on their report. Areas identified as needing support include education and human resource development, including capacity building, the justice sector and help in developing a regulatory framework.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also contributing to the relief effort through our membership of the EU. The European community humanitarian office has disbursed three million euros in response to the crisis. This is in addition to two million euros disbursed prior to the conflict. A further ten million euros is in the process of being allocated for food and medicines for the Timorese people. Commissioner Nielson is currently heading a mission to the region to assess the situation with regard to providing further assistance for reconstruction.</P>
    <P>The long-term aim of international assistance to the people of East Timor is to help them in setting up the administrative structures to allow them to prepare for full independence. The departure of the Indonesian officials and military, who governed the region for decades, resulted in the collapse of the administrative structures. Although the multinational forces have been <Col N="460" /> deployed in East Timor to provide security in the region, Government organs, such as administrative offices, police and a judiciary system are not yet in place.</P>
    <P>An international donors conference focusing on aiding recovery in East Timor is scheduled to take place on 17 December in Tokyo.</P>

      <P>Ireland is owed approximately IR£8.3 million for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. Since 1 January 1999, the UN has repaid arrears of approximately £5.4 million to Ireland, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover from the United Nations the monies owed. The Department, through the permanent mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations headquarters in this regard. During the UN Secretary General's visit <Col N="461" /> to Ireland last January, I raised the issue of UN arrears in respect of our participation in UN peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day to day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
    <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears situation would ease the situation considerably. During my visit to the UN General Assembly in September, I joined my EU colleagues in raising the matter with Secretary of State Albright. The United States administration has very recently put forward a plan agreed with Congress to deal with the arrears problem. While the repayment amount proposed in the plan is substantially less than the total arrears owed by the US, negotiations on the matter are under way at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We hope that efforts to resolve the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries. Ireland's permanent mission to the UN in New York will continue to pursue this issue actively.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to visits to Ireland of Ministers for Foreign Affairs or related visits, for example, by senior members of international organisations.</P>
      <P>It is usual international practice for a Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a number of visits abroad each year and to invite ministerial and organisational counterparts to visit Ireland. The pattern of such visits takes account of developments in bilateral relations, current international issues and the diary commitments of both host and visitor.</P>
      <P>In the context of the European Union, we would expect foreign ministerial or related visits from Portugal and France, who will each hold the presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2000.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the current accession process was launched by the 15 EU member states, the ten central and eastern European states and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. The following day actual negotiations were inaugurated with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus. These countries are often referred to as the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; or &ldquo;5+1&rdquo;. Negotiations have continued with these countries since then on a policy chapter basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a preparatory process for negotiations has continued with the other original applicants, the so-called &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&ndash; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. Malta, joined this group in 1999.</P>
      <P>The recent composite report of the Commission recommends that the Helsinki European Council extend negotiations to the pre-ins group in the new year. Thus the negotiation process would be extended to 12 countries. Ireland supports that recommendation. We also support the commission proposal that the negotiation process be modified somewhat to allow for differentiation. This would take account of each candidate's progress in preparing for membership when deciding which negotiation chapters would be opened and proceeded with by each country.</P>
      <P>As regards timeframe, we agree with the view that primary importance must be attached to the negotiation process. The success of that process will dictate the timing of accessions. However, it would be reasonable, as the Commission suggests, that the EU commit itself to being able to decide from 2002 on the accession of candidate countries which fulfil all the necessary criteria.</P>

      <P>The statute of the international criminal court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 90 states have signed the statute and, of these, five have ratified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Indeed, Ireland was <Col N="463" /> anxious to sign the statute at an early date in order to signal our strong political support for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
    <P>A time lapse is normal between signature and ratification. The purpose of this time lapse is to allow each signatory state to consider what measures need to be taken in their domestic legal systems prior to ratification. The measures required prior to ratification and the timeframe involved will vary from state to state.</P>
    <P>At the international level, this is one of the issues being discussed by delegations at the preparatory commission established after the Rome conference to address matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force. The preparatory commission is currently meeting in New York. The aim of these discussions is to ensure that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. A careful and detailed examination of the statute by my Department, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary in order to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>Ireland and all other member states of the European Union have committed themselves to take whatever measures are required within their respective domestic legal systems to enable them to ratify the statute expeditiously. Of the EU member states, Italy is the only one to have ratified the statute to date, but most other states aim to ratify by the end of 2000. In addition, the member states of the EU have called on all states to sign and ratify the statute as a matter of priority so that its entry into force can be secured at an early date. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I can assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Since the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which authorised the deployment of KFOR and the setting up of the United Nations interim administration mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, the situation in the province has radically changed. KFOR has taken over much of the responsibility for security in Kosovo, in conjunction with the international police force, which is directly under UN control. Alongside UNMIK several international organisations have moved into Kosovo. These include the UNHCR to deal with returning refugees, the OSCE, which has been charged with institution building, the Council of Europe which is providing experts in fields such as law, human rights and local democracy, and the EU reconstruction agency. Non-governmental organisations active in Kosovo include Concern and GOAL.</P>
      <P>The major immediate concerns for both KFOR and UNMIK have been to stabilise the security situation and to ensure that the Kosovar population are provided with adequate shelter for the coming winter.</P>
      <P>Attacks by returning Kosovo Albanian refugees have been mainly directed at the Serbian and Roma communities. These have forced virtually all non-Albanians either to leave Kosovo or to gather in ethnic centres, which are effectively ghettoes. The UNHCR estimates that there are now over 150,000 Kosovo Serbs in Serbia and Montenegro. Recently KFOR has been able to reduce the number of these attacks and there are indications that small numbers of Serbs are returning but relations between ethnic groups are still tense. The main Kosovar Albanian political leaders seem to be conscious of the dangers as they have disassociated themselves from attacks against non-Albanians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the difficult security situation, UNMIK and KFOR, together with the other <Col N="465" /> agencies, are working to increase participation by the local communities in governing themselves. A transition council has been set up, and it is intended to turn this into an executive council.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made by the OSCE in setting up so-called political centres with the aim of providing resources to all democratic political parties in Kosovo. A police force is now being trained, and the reform of the legal system is under way with the assistance of the Council of Europe. A start is being made in registering people for elections which are tentatively planned for next year.</P>
    <P>The priority in the area of humanitarian assistance is to provide a minimum degree of shelter for the many thousands of Kosovars whose homes were destroyed or seriously damaged during the conflict. A winterization programme is currently being implemented by the UNHCR in co-operation with a number of NGOs the aim of which is to ensure that at least one heated room is available for each family. Communal shelters to accommodate those whose houses were totally destroyed are also being set up.</P>
    <P>Although UNMIK and all involved in Kosovo have approached their tasks with imagination, there are many difficulties ahead. First, UNMIK is short of resources to pay the salaries of local functionaries, such as teachers, municipal employees and civil servants. Second, there is a major problem of organised crime. Some of it is being perpetrated by Albanian based gangs specialising in human trafficking, drug smuggling and money laundering. Third, there have been reports of violence between supporters of different political parties within the Albanian community.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, given the very difficult situation which UNMIK and KFOR faced when they first arrived in Kosovo in July last I believe that both can be commended for the progress made to date, but it is also clear that the continued support of the international community for their efforts in terms of both finance and personnel will be required for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the Council of Europe is playing an important role in the recovery of Kosovo and in my capacity as chairman of the committee of Ministers of the Council, I intend to visit Kosovo early in the new year to see for myself the situation on the ground there.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in the Dublin Declaration of 9 June 1998, I launched an initiative to achieve a nuclear weapon-free world, together with my colleagues, the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> The new agenda proposes that the nuclear weapon states undertake a new and unequivocal commitment to the speedy and total elimination of their nuclear arsenals. Having made such a commitment, they are called upon to proceed without delay to an accelerated process of negotiations with a view to achieving nuclear disarmament at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>At the 1998 session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Ireland tabled a resolution on behalf of the new agenda delegations and 25 additional co-sponsors, which secured the support of 114 delegations, with 38 abstentions and 18 negative votes.</P>
    <P>At the third preparatory committee meeting of the states parties to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, held in April this year, the new agenda once again tabled a proposal for the approach to the 2000 NPT review conference, with a co-sponsorship which had by then increased to 44 delegations.</P>
    <P>Yesterday at the plenary of the General Assembly in New York, the second new agenda resolution which included 59 co-sponsoring delegations, was adopted with 111 votes in favour, 39 abstentions and 13 votes against.</P>
    <P>In the coming year the new agenda coalition will focus on the 2000 NPT review conference with a view to securing from the nuclear weapon states the agreement of the states parties to the commitments and the agenda set out in the new agenda.</P>
    <P>The 2000 NPT review conference is scheduled for next April. It will be a particularly important gathering of the states parties. Recent developments, including nuclear testing by India and Pakistan, and non-compliance by Iraq and North Korea, weigh heavily on the international community.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as the initiator of the NPT, has a particular role and responsibility in upholding this cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. The Government is committed to work for the full achievement of the goals of the treaty.</P>

      <Quest>the complaints, if any, regarding racism received by his Department or the embassy in London from Irish nationals in Britain; the complaints, if any, regarding harassment by police officers and immigration officials at ports and airports; the statistics covering these occurrences over the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaints of racist treatment and/or harassment by public authorities such as police, prison and immigration officers are occasionally received from Irish people residing in or visiting Britain. Precise statistics are not kept but the incidence of such complaints has diminished in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> In June 1997 the Commission for Racial Equality in Britain published a report on discrimination and the Irish community in Britain which concluded that there was an extremely strong resistance to recognition of the distinctiveness of Irish experience in Britain which results in a lack of acknowledgement of Irish needs and rights but at the same time there was a widespread, and almost completely unquestioned, acceptance of anti-Irish racism in British society. This was the first major report to be commissioned by an official British agency on the Irish in Britain. The report drew attention to discrimination in a number of areas and contained recommendations to Government agencies, statutory bodies, voluntary agencies and private companies about addressing this situation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is, of course, concerned about any expression of prejudice or discrimination against our community in Britain and, through the Embassy in London, we are encouraging action by British Government bodies and voluntary Irish organisations to follow through on the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The Embassy brings individual complaints of anti-Irish behaviour to the attention of the public bodies involved and complainants are reminded of the legal redress options available to them under the Race Relations Act.</P>
    <P>Complaints arising from the experiences of Irish passengers at British ports and airports mostly relate to the operation within Britain of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>The Government has frequently expressed to the British authorities our concerns regarding the operation of provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, such as the powers relating to port and border controls, the application of which has a disproportionate impact on persons travelling between the two islands. Complaints made to us about specific instances of the use of these powers are also raised with the British authorities through the embassy in London.</P>

      <P>Following the unleashing of violence and destruction in East Timor after the announcement of the result of the referendum on independence, the General Affairs Council, at its meeting on 13 September, adopted a number of measures against Indonesia. It agreed for a period of four months on an embargo on the export of arms, munitions and military equipment, a ban on the supply of equipment which might be used for internal repression or terrorism, and a suspension of bilateral military co-operation.</P>
      <P>I made clear at that time that I had sought to have these measures adopted for an indefinite period, but I also indicated that it was not possible to get agreement for an initial period longer than four months. The council in January will decide, in the light of the situation then prevailing, on a possible further suspension, for a period to be determined.</P>
      <P>The council has monitored developments in Indonesia closely since September, and has noted the many challenges facing the new, democratic administration of President Wahid, as well as the new opportunities that exist. In that context the council agreed on 15 November that human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and a well-functioning judiciary as well as good governance are cornerstones in Indonesia's further development. It further stressed that reforms in the military and police should continue and that their roles in society be adjusted accordingly. When the embargo is reviewed by the council in January, I shall expect EU partners to take account of these principles as well as developments on the ground, including in relation to East Timor.</P>

There has been no change in the status of these two measures since I gave that reply.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 54, 60 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the continuing loss of civilian life in Chechnya and the plight of the refugees fleeing from the conflict zone. Russia has been bombing alleged rebel bases in Chechnya since 5 September, has occupied up to half of Chechnya, and has almost encircled the Chechen capital, Grozny. An estimated 350,000 Chechens have been displaced, some 233,000 of whom are now in the neighbouring Russian republic of Ingushetia</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's concerns have been made clear to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions, most recently by the Taoiseach in his meeting with President Yeltsin in the margins of the OSCE <Col N="470" /> summit in Istanbul on 18 November. In his address to the summit, the Taoiseach called for an immediate halt to the military campaign. The Government welcomed Russia's agreement at the Istanbul Summit that a political solution is essential and that the assistance of the OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal. The Government also welcomed Russia's agreement to a visit by the chairman-in-office of the OSCE, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, to the region. We are, however, concerned that it did not prove possible to agree dates for a visit to Chechnya when Foreign Minister Vollebaek went to Moscow on Monday, 29 November, to discuss his Caucasus trip with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov. We are also concerned at Russia's reported rejection of OSCE mediation aimed at resolving the Chechnya conflict, despite its apparent openness in Istanbul to an OSCE role.</P>
    <P>On 15 November at the last meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, my colleagues and I condemned all disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya. We called for dialogue between Russia and the elected leaders of the North Caucasus, including Chechnya, and reminded all parties to the conflict of the necessity to observe international humanitarian law. We stated that we were holding the Russian Government to its word that it was not seeking a military solution in Chechnya, which would turn out to be a major political mistake.</P>
    <P>There have been several reports of Russian attacks on refugee convoys. Ireland and its European Union partners have made clear to the Russian authorities on several occasions, and at the highest level, their view that attacks on civilians and refugees are totally unacceptable. As regards comparisons with the &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo; perpetrated in Kosovo, Russia has claimed that the purpose of its action in Chechnya is not to drive Chechens out of Chechnya, but to prevent any further incursions by Chechen guerillas into other parts of Russia and they state that it is for this reason they closed the border with Ingushetia temporarily some weeks ago, preventing Chechens from leaving the area. More recently, Russia has been resettling Chechens in the area north of the Terek river controlled by it.</P>
    <P>The Government's concerns regarding reports of attacks on civilians have been made known directly to the Russian authorities, and we will continue to press our view, both directly and through EU contacts, that there can be no military solution to the Chechnya conflict. The question of economic sanctions against the Russian Federation is one which requires very careful consideration. The Government is not convinced at this stage that economic sanctions against Russia would be effective in relation to the objectives of the international community concerning Chechnya. We believe that our efforts should rather be directed towards helping Russia see that only a political solution, arrived at by dialogue, has a long-term prospect of bringing lasting peace to the region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> Ireland assumed the chairmanship of the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe at the council's ministerial session in Strasbourg on 4 November. I believe that the council must be able to respond to challenges such as those presenting themselves in the Caucasus including Chechnya. There are a number of possible areas where the expertise provided by the Council of Europe, could contribute to a long-term political settlement to the problems in Chechnya. In particular these concern the areas of democratisation, the rule of law and protection of human rights. A first step would be for the council to assess the situation from the humanitarian and human rights point of view. The present visit by the new Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Alvaro Gil-Robles, to the Northern Caucasus offers an opportunity for both dialogue and proposals for possible follow-up action.</P>
    <P>The council has made known to the Russian authorities its readiness to provide support for a peaceful, political settlement in Chechnya. I have made very clear, as chairman of the committee of Ministers, that I will do everything possible to assist in this, including the possibility of a visit to the region. All that is required is the consent and request of the Russian authorities.</P>

After considerable research, the claim together with a substantial number of exhibits was prepared in my Department in June 1995 and sent to the Irish Embassy in Bonn for onward transmission to the German authorities. In October 1995 an informal response indicated that the German authorities were not prepared to accept responsibility. The Irish Embassy understood that the door was being left open in that informal response for further representations. A draft communication in reply was prepared by my Department and sent to our embassy in Bonn for onward transmission to the German authorities.

      <P>The Cologne European Council in June confirmed its intention to convene an Intergovernmental Conference early in 2000. It stipulated that the conference should address three issues: the size and composition of the Commission; the weighting of votes in the council; and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the council. However, it left open the precise scope of the agenda as it recognised that a limited number of other necessary treaty amendments could also be discussed.</P>
      <P>In September, in his capacity as President designate of the Commission, Mr Prodi, appointed a group chaired by former Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, to advise the Commission, as one of the participants in the Intergovernmental Conference, on the institutional implications of enlargement.</P>
      <P>The Dehaene report was submitted to the Commission and published on 18 October. It does not bind the council or the member states in any way. On 10 November, the Commission published its own first contribution to the preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference which reflected several of the ideas in the Dehaene report.</P>
      <P>The Finnish Presidency, at the invitation of the Cologne European Council, is drawing up, on its own responsibility, for the European Council meeting in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December a report taking stock of options. The presidency will, of course, be taking into account the views of the Commission as well as those of member states. In finalising its report, the presidency will take account of initial discussions in Brussels as well as of bilateral contacts with the member states, including the views expressed to Prime Minister Lipponen in his pre-European Council tour of capitals. The scope of the Intergovernmental Conference is expected to be determined by the Heads of State or Government when they meet in Helsinki.</P>
      <P>The Government can agree with a number of elements in the Dehaene report. It agrees, for example, on the importance of concluding the Intergovernmental Conference by the end of next year so as not to delay the enlargement process and of avoiding constant revisions of the treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the scope of the Intergovernmental <Col N="473" /> Conference, the Dehaene report also identifies a number of institutional issues, closely related to those identified at Cologne, which could appropriately be addressed by the conference. These include an extension of the co-decision procedure with the European Parliament, the individual responsibility of commissioners within the commission and amendments relating the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>However, in common with most member states, we tend to favour a relatively limited agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference and consequently do not favour the Dehaene report's suggestion that the agenda should be expanded to embrace issues such as flexibility or a reorganisation of the present treaties in such a way that a majority of the provisions could be amended in future without recourse to an Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>As regards defence, work should proceed on the basis of the agreed and carefully balanced modalities laid down at Cologne which entrusted follow-up work to the Finnish Presidency which is due to present a progress report to Helsinki. We do not wish to prejudge the outcome of that separate process and do not, therefore, accept any implication in the Dehaene report that defence matters should feature in the next Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>In view of the intergovernmental nature of the Intergovernmental Conference process, there appears to have been very little support for the Dehaene report's procedural suggestion that the Commission should be mandated to submit a draft treaty at the outset of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As regards the substance of the issues to be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference, Ireland is prepared to look at some reweighting of votes in the council if and only the larger member states are prepared to accept the principle of one commissioner per member state and to forego their right to nominate a second member of the Commission. The necessary linkage in this regard is not brought out as clearly as we would wish in the Dehaene report.</P>
    <P>We can consider some further extension of qualified majority voting for normal community business. However, the suggestion in the Dehaene report that QMV should be the rule would be regarded by most member states as unrealistic. Unanimity should be retained in a number of sensitive areas including in particular, as far as we are concerned, the taxation area.</P>

      <P>The devastating earthquakes that struck the Marmara region of Turkey in August and again in November of this year, have resulted in great human suffering. Thousands were killed with many more left injured. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless.</P>
      <P>The first earthquake to hit the region on 17 August measured 7.4 on the Richter scale and resulted in the devastation of lives and homes. The Turkish authorities immediately requested international assistance. The response to the request was timely and substantial with help coming from EU member states and many other countries such as the USA, Japan and Israel. The official death toll from that earthquake now stands at over 17,000 and the number of reported injured stands at almost 44,000. Three hundred thousand homes were destroyed and there are currently 130,000 people are living in tent cities with a further 80,000 living in <i>ad hoc</i> settlements.</P>
      <P>Aftershocks have continued in the region since 17 August. On 12 November a second major earthquake struck Duzce, a populated area just 100 kilometres from Izmit, the centre of the August earthquake. Building on their earlier experience, the Government response was quick and effective. Once again international search and rescue teams arrived at the site within hours. Latest Turkish Government figures put the death toll from this most recent quake at over 500, with over 3,000 injured.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government has been to the forefront in providing humanitarian aid to the victims of these disasters. We co-ordinated our response with the aid flowing in from other countries and concentrated on meeting the priority needs of the thousands of wounded and homeless.</P>
      <P>In the days following the first earthquake an initial grant of IR£200,000 was made to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent to enable them to purchase essential supplies such as food, water and any available medicines locally.</P>
      <P>A further £200,000 was allocated to the United Nations relief agencies operating in the region. This was divided between the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, and UNICEF. A sum of £50,000 was granted to OCHA to assist the Turkish Government in co-ordinating the relief effort. The remaining £150,000 was allocated to UNICEF to address essential needs by providing water and sanitation and supplying humanitarian goods such as bedding, fuel and medicines.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Turkish Government, £190,000 was used to purchase medical supplies and water purification tablets in Ireland, which were unavailable in Turkey. Over four metric tonnes of these goods were transported to Istanbul, at no cost, by Aer Lingus and Turkish Airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the second earthquake that struck Duzce at the beginning of this month, a further £150,000 was allocated for the relief of <Col N="475" /> those affected. This money was divided between UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP. UNDP has a shelter programme addressing the needs of those left homeless by both earthquakes. UNICEF is addressing the nutritional needs of children and pregnant mothers living in shelters and is providing materials for tent schools. Both UNICEF and UNDP are also providing tents, sleeping bags, generators and stoves to the homeless. This recent allocation brings Ireland's humanitarian assistance to the victims of the earthquakes to almost three quarters of a million pounds.</P>
    <P>The European Union, on behalf of the member states has also responded generously. The European Commission <i>via</i> the European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; announced initial grants totalling four 4 million in emergency humanitarian assistance in response to the first earthquake. Following the most recent earthquake, an allocation of 3 million was made to ECHO NGO partners currently in the field, for the provision of immediate temporary shelter and emergency medicines. These grants are part of a planned 30 million package of humanitarian assistance. The remaining 23 million will be allocated in the coming weeks. This further funding will focus on addressing the needs of the persons made homeless by the disaster, providing weather resistant shelter and ensuring basic medical care. An ECHO technical assistant has been posted to Istanbul in order to facilitate further assessments and programming.</P>
    <P>While the emergency response to the needs of the survivors of both quakes was quick and comprehensive, the Turkish Government now faces the formidable task of rebuilding the Marmara region. They are being supported in this by the international community. The immediate and long-term reconstruction effort in Turkey is being funded on a multilateral basis. The European Commission is proceeding with plans for new and substantial assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction. It is proposed that loans of up to 600 million be provided to Turkey to assist in the reconstruction process. In addition, 150 million earmarked as regional aid for Turkey, will be allocated to assist in the reconstruction effort. Substantial assistance is also being provided by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, among others.</P>
    <P>While the scale of these disasters has stretched available resources to their limits, fortunately Turkey is a developed country which has considerable resources with which to respond to the earthquakes. Turkey's large modern armed forces can be mobilised to assist relief efforts. The economy can support much of the relief and reconstruction efforts. Therefore, the role of the international community is to assist and facilitate the Turkish Government and people in their own efforts to deal with their current problems.</P>

      <P>The situation and treatment of children in Pakistani prisons is a matter of serious concern. A report on this subject by Human Rights Watch bears out findings previously reported by Amnesty International. Apart from concern arising from the details of the many individual cases documented, the systematic violations of Pakistani law which also occur, and the resulting failure of Pakistan to honour its obligations and commitments under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which it is a party, are matters which must be addressed by the Pakistani authorities.</P>
      <P>While the report deals with the period preceding the recent military coup, I am not aware of any subsequent improvement in the situation.</P>
      <P>General Musharraf has stated his intention to improve and reform Pakistan and to respect fully basic human rights and civil liberties. We are still awaiting details of the intended programme of his administration, but I believe that issue of child prisoners should be included in it.</P>

      <P>Turkey's application for EU membership was tabled in 1987. In its recent report the commission proposes that the time may now be right for the EU to formally endorse this candidature. Ireland broadly supports the position put forward by the Commission. However, no formal negotiations will begin with Turkey until that country fulfils the requirements of the Copenhagen criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 June, Prime Minister Ecevit promised that his Government would undertake legal reform to improve observance of human rights in Turkey. He explained that the Government's priority is to develop democracy, improve human rights, expand freedom of thought and ensure an effective judicial system. The strengthening of Turkey's links with the European Union depends on Turkey's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and respect for and protection of minorities. The Commission has reiterated the necessity of Turkey meeting both the political and economic criteria, as set out in the Copenhagen criteria and has called for enhanced political dialogue, with particular reference to the issue of human rights. The EU has also pointed out to Turkey that the execution of Abdullah Ocalan would delay the recognition of <Col N="478" /> Turkey as a candidate for EU accession for a very long time. Together with EU partners, Ireland considers adherence to the Copenhagen criteria, including recognition of minorities and respect for their rights, to be an essential political qualification for EU accession.</P>

      <P>The matter of whether Switzerland should become a member of the European Union is in the first instance one for the Swiss Government and people, whose decision to date has been not to pursue membership of the Union. Should the position in this regard change in the coming years, the Union would, I am confident, be ready to discuss the conditions which would govern Swiss accession. In the meantime, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any possible timetable.</P>
      <P>The European Union recently negotiated seven sectoral agreements with Switzerland and these were signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999, in the margins of the meeting of the General Affairs Council. The agreements cover the free movement of persons, air transport, rail and road transport, public procurement, scientific and technological co-operation, agriculture and mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment. The last mentioned is intended to eliminate technical barriers to trade. Each of the agreements is free standing but forms a package to be applied in parallel for an initial period of seven years. In the event that any of the agreements were not extended or were rejected by either party, all seven agreements would fall automatically, unless the other party could accept a re-balanced package.</P>
      <P>Of the seven agreements signed, six fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union, while the seventh, the agreement on the free movement of persons, is a mixed competence agreement, which means that the individual member states of the EU, must also become parties to it. This agreement was also signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland on 21 June 1999. The relevant Government Departments are now reviewing the agreement to see if our domestic legislation and administrative arrangements need to be changed before the State could formally ratify it. As it is expected that the agreement could involve a charge on public funds, the approval of Dáil Éireann will be required for ratification in accordance with article 29.5.2º of the Constitution. The appropriate motion will be put before the Dáil when the review mentioned has been completed.</P>

      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In the recent review of the action programme, the Government committed itself to support the strengthening of the capacity of the international community, in particular through the UN and the renewal process that will follow the millennium assembly, to make effective humanitarian interventions to halt conflict and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government. I raised it most recently in my address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September. While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, the overall pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We very much hope that the millennium summit and assembly in 2000 will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action-oriented outcome which will <Col N="480" /> strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>
    <P>In March 1997, the Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The Track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN development assistance framework under which UN agencies involved in development assistance will co-operate more closely at country level in an effort to avoid duplication. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office.</P>
    <P>The Track II reform proposals, on which progress has been made, include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the Secretary General and the creation of a new post of deputy secretary general with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998. A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    <P>In my speech to the General Assembly on 25 September, I expressed my full support for the UN Secretary General in his efforts to bring about a renewed, reformed and more vigorous UN. This is essential to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of security council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the security council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the security council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the security council and other matters related to the council. The issues involved are enlargement of security council membership, the council's working methods and its decision making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the council for 2001-02.</P>
    <P>On security council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that the working group has not yet been unable to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The situation in the successor states to the former Yugoslavia differs considerably from country to country.</P>
      <P>In the case of Slovenia which, with Croatia, was first to break away from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, considerable progress has been made. Slovenia is stable internally with a strong democratic basis. It is the wealthiest, most developed and industrialised of the former Yugoslav republics and has a per capita GDP level close to the lower EU levels. Slovenia is expected to become an EU member state with the completion of the first round of accession negotiations in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Croatia too has made progress since the ending of its conflict with Serbia in 1995. However, concerns remain over its electoral laws and the excessive Government control of the media. The Croatian Government has also been criticised by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for its lack of co-operation with the tribunal particularly in relation to possible war crimes committed during <Col N="482" /> operations Flash and Storm in 1995. These issues have recently been the subject of a high level demarche by the EU in Zagreb.</P>
    <P>Another issue causing concern is that of refugee return. Most of the returnees are ethnic Serbs from Eastern Slavonia and the Krajina region. Croatia has verbally committed itself to implement a programme of refugee return, but the results have not met the expectations of the international community. There are continual reports that in spite of the commitments of the Croatian authorities, it is difficult to get restitution of property and in some cases there is open harassment of ethnic Serb returnees.</P>
    <P>President Tudjman is reported to be very seriously ill. Last week the Croatian National Assembly passed new emergency legislation providing for the speaker of the assembly to become acting president in the event of the incapacity of the president. One of the first decisions of the acting president was to schedule elections to the National Assembly for 3 January. That date is a matter of concern since its proximity to both Christmas and the millennium celebrations will restrict the possibility of proper monitoring of the election campaign by international monitors.</P>
    <P>The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a matter of international concern. The last elections were held in September 1998. While they produced gains for the hardline nationalists the international community took comfort from the fact that there were some signs of a move towards more moderate less ethnically based parties. There was particular concern about the situation in Republika Srpska &ndash; RS &ndash; where the hardline Serb nationalist candidate Nikola Poplasen won the Presidency, although moderates were able to hold a majority in the National Assembly elections.</P>
    <P>Throughout 1999 both the Federation Government and the overall Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency have continued to function. In RS, however, the high representative has been obliged to use his powers to remove Mr. Poplasen from the presidency, owing to his attempts to circumvent the Dayton agreement. He has been replaced by his vice-president, Mirko Sarovic. Politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina concern the position of the ethnic communities in relation to each other and specifically the implementation of refugee return.</P>
    <P>A draft election law for Bosnia and Herzegovina is under discussion in the Bosnian National Assembly and it is envisaged that it will be in force for elections to take place next year. Although the law cannot solve all the problems of the divided society, it is regarded as important in facilitating the selection of officials promoting compromise.</P>
    <P>The prosecution of war criminals from the Bosnian war by the International Criminal Tribunal &ndash; ICTY &ndash; in the Hague is another priority for the international community. In this regard, the fact that Radivan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic remain at large is a matter for concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> Like most of the former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia Herzegovina has a long-term aim of integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures. As a first step, Bosnia Herzegovina applied for membership of the Council of Europe earlier this year. Following a report from the team of rapporteurs sent by the council it was decided that Bosnia was not yet ready to become a member. This is an issue which is likely to be considered further during Ireland's current chairmanship of the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>In the case of Serbia there are, unfortunately, no indications that Milosevic's hold on power is in any way diminished and demonstrations organised on various occasions in the autumn have petered out without any visible impact on the regime. The EU, the US and associated countries have been attempting to encourage greater unity in the opposition forces, but so far with limited success. The economy of the country is collapsing as a result of ten years of more or less continuous conflict and the more recent bombing campaign and economic sanctions. The Serbian people are facing into a difficult winter with shortages of energy for heating and questionable food supplies, especially in the remoter regions.</P>
    <P>The main issue currently exercising the international community is how to maintain the pressure on Milosevic without at the same time punishing the ordinary people of Serbia. I have dealt with the issue of economic sanctions against Serbia in some detail in my reply to Question No. 124 from Deputy Bruton of 9 November.</P>
    <P>So far as Kosovo is concerned, I refer the Deputy to my replies to separate questions on that issue in the House today.</P>
    <P>The situation in Montenegro, the remaining republic within the Yugoslav Federation, is also very worrying. The democratically elected Government of that country is seeking to enhance its relationship with the EU and other democratic countries in the face of hostility from the Milosevic regime. As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 119 of 23 November from Deputy Bruton, the EU is in consultation with the Montenegran Government on a practical assistance programme for that country and the main economic sanctions against the FRY were recently lifted in the case of Montenegro.</P>
    <P>The main recent development in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &ndash; FYROM &ndash; was the election for the presidency of the country. The Supreme Court in FYROM decided over the weekend that the elections should be repeated in 199 polling stations predominately in the western part of the country and areas close to Skopje on the basis that there were irregularities in those regions. The state election commission announced that the partial rerun of voting will take place on 5 December and, taking into account their earlier rulings, the rerun will cover a total of 230 polling stations. The EU recently appealed to all political forces to continue to show moderation in their democratic compe<Col N="484" /> tition, to support a fair and timely conclusion to the electoral process, and to respect the final result of the elections.</P>
    <P>Support for the process of peace, democratisation and economic development in the countries of the western Balkans is the aim of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe, an initiative of the EU, which was agreed in Cologne in June 1999, and was formally launched at the summit meeting of Heads of Government in Sarajevo at the end of July last. It represents the collective effort of the European Union, the G-8 countries, the countries of the region and the key international organisations to address the challenges of the region in a co-ordinated and strategic manner. There are currently more than 40 participants in the pact, including most European countries and such international organisations as the OSCE, OECD, international financial institutions, Council of Europe and the UN and its various humanitarian agencies. The US is a full participant and Japan and Canada have observer status. There is provision to welcome the FRY as a full participant when democratic conditions are restored to that country.</P>

      <P>Ireland warmly welcomed the return to democratically elected civilian rule in Nigeria in May of this year.

      <P>I visited Kenya from 21 to 23 November. During the visit I met with a number of Irish missionaries and non-governmental organisations and Government leaders, and visited a variety of projects including those funded or supported by Irish aid.</P>
      <P>In Nairobi I met with representatives of Concern and Trócaire at their headquarters, as well as representatives of GOAL, Gorta and Irish missionaries who outlined their work in Kenya and the region, including in Somalia. We discussed a number of issues, including the current humanitarian and security situation in Somalia, and prospects for the Intergovernmental Authority on Development &ndash; IGAD &ndash; peace process. I availed of the opportunity to confirm Ireland's support, together with our European Union partners, towards the achievement of a peaceful resolution of these problems.</P>
      <P>Throughout my visit I was briefed on a number of issues, including operational concerns on the part of some of the NGOs.

      <P>The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is one of the cornerstones of the nuclear disarma<Col N="486" /> ment process. It is essential that its entry into force be assured at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The treaty cannot enter into force without the ratification of 44 listed states including the US. Ireland and our EU partners have on several occasions, including at the Tampere European Council, expressed our deep regret at the decision of the US Senate not to ratify the treaty.

      <P>I urge all of those 44 states which have yet to do so to sign and ratify the treaty .</P>
      <P>A conference of states party to the CTBT was held in Vienna from 6 to 8 October this year, shortly before the vote in the US Senate. That conference issued a declaration which called upon all states, and especially those states whose ratification is required to permit entry into force, to sign and ratify the treaty as soon as possible. Ireland participated actively in the conference itself and in the preparation of the declaration.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparations for entry into force, work on implementing the international monitoring system which will verify compliance with the treaty, and which must be operational when it enters into force, is continuing and is expected to accelerate over the coming period.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the &ldquo;Western Europe and Others&rdquo; group of states for the two year term 2001-02. The election will take place in October 2000. The election is being contested by three other candidates: Norway, Turkey and Italy. Successful candidates will require the support of two thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 125 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions. In the past 14 months, he has personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with the For<Col N="487" /> eign Ministers or Prime Ministers of approximately 100 member states of the United Nations. In September, he attended the 54th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York where, in addition to participating in the general debate, he had bilateral contact with a large number of Foreign Ministers or Prime Ministers. Since then, the Minister has raised the matter with a number of other Governments, including some in East Africa which he recently visited.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government, as well as a number of Ministers of State, have also promoted the Irish candidacy in their contacts with other administrations, where this was appropriate.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated previously, this is a strongly contested election. He is reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. Let me say simply that the Government is gratified by the broad support our candidacy has attracted.</P>

The advice is about the possibility that in some countries computer systems may be affected by the &ldquo;millennium bug&rdquo; and that essential services such as transport, telecommunications, financial, medical, police, electricity or water supply services may be disrupted or break down, at least temporarily. It is not possible to accurately predict what will happen but the potential for disruption of travel plans should be recognised.</P>
      <P>Irish citizens planning to be abroad in the first week or so of January 2000 are being alerted to the possibility of disruption of some services and advised to make contingency plans to cope with the difficulties that would ensue.

      <P>Although the situation in Algeria remains difficult, there are signs that it is starting to emerge from the years of violence and to make progress towards national reconciliation and reconstruction.</P>
      <P>In June, the Islamic Salvation Army &ndash; AIS &ndash; confirmed that its campaign of violence had ended. The Islamic Salvation Front &ndash; FIS &ndash; while still outlawed, endorsed this announcement. This renunciation of violence continues despite the murder last week, by opponents of the reconciliation process, of one of the Islamic Salvation Front's leading advocates of dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Assembly has enacted legislation, which President Bouteflika introduced as part of a new civil concord, granting an amnesty to the <Col N="489" /> AIS militants and their supporters who renounce violence. On 5 July the 37th anniversary of Algerian independence, the first stage of the amnesty, which is expected to lead to the release of 5,000 detainees, was put into effect.</P>
    <P>On 16 September, an overwhelming majority approved the referendum on the President's proposals which are aimed at achieving peace and civil concord.

      <P>The agreement signed at Sharm-el-Sheik on 4 September reflected the commitment of the new Israeli Government to move forward with negotiations on all outstanding issues. In bilateral meetings which I had with a number of Foreign Ministers in New York attending the UN General Assembly in late September, I stressed the full support of the Government for this process.</P>
      <P>I have also supported fully the involvement of the European Union. The Union affords political and economic support for a negotiated settlement in the Middle East, to reflect the principle of &ldquo;land for peace&rdquo; and to ensure the security, both collective and individual, of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. It does so on the political level through the work of its special envoy, its meetings with leaders of the various parties involved in the peace process, and its activities in relevant international organisations, in particular the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Union is exploring with parties in and outside the region how, against the background of progress on the Palestinian track, early progress <Col N="490" /> can be achieved on the multilateral, the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks.</P>
    <P>On the economic level, the European Union also provides significant financial and technical support. The union and its member states are the largest donors of international aid to the region in support of the peace process. The Union also provides technical assistance in critically important areas such as water and refugees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most serious challenges facing the international community is that of the debt burden on developing countries, especially the poorest. Debt repayments required of many heavily indebted poor countries or HIPC's are greatly in excess of development assistance flows. The efforts of many of the most impoverished countries to achieve sustainable development are frustrated by their level of indebtedness. This is unacceptable and calls for a positive and comprehensive response by the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the debt burden in the developing world is one in which I have long taken a keen interest. The Government is very conscious of the extent of public support for the Jubilee 2000 Campaign which is calling for debt cancellation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his address to the 54th General Assembly of the United Nations, recognised the strength of international concern about the debt of poor countries including the urgent demands for debt forgiveness. He informed the General Assembly of the Irish Government's decision last year to direct resources to both bilateral and multilateral debt <Col N="491" /> relief, and also to make it integral to Ireland's overall development co-operation strategy.</P>
    <P>While recognised as well-intentioned, the HIPC debt initiative launched by the Bretton Woods institutions in 1996 failed to make a significant impact in the majority of the heavily indebted poor countries. There have, however, been positive developments on the debt front over the course of recent months.</P>
    <P>The annual general meeting of the World Bank and IMF in Washington in September agreed an enhanced HIPC initiative which is a significant advance on its predecessor. By relaxing the criteria for eligibility, the new initiative is expected to double the amount of debt relief available under the initiative and to increase the number of recipient countries from 29 to 36. The enhanced initiative strengthens the relationship between debt relief and poverty alleviation. In this respect, it reflects one of the central points raised in our own national submission to the HIPC review. As part of the new initiative, each recipient country will produce a &ldquo;poverty reduction strategy paper&rdquo;, designed to ensure that the resources freed by debt relief will be of direct benefit to those in the greatest need.</P>
    <P>If it is to make a real difference, the enhanced HIPC must receive the funding it requires as soon as possible. In that connection, Ireland is advocating that the most generous possible EU support be made available to the enhanced HIPC initiative. The General Affairs Council is close to agreement on a package which would provide an EU contribution of 1 billion to debt relief and a further 250 million for structural adjustment.</P>
    <P>Many heavily indebted poor countries have undertaken major structural reforms to their economies in order to qualify for debt relief. Under the enhanced initiative, debt repayments by these countries should fall to a level which is sustainable and which do not deflect scarce resources from important social sectors such as health and education. The impact in recipient countries will be extremely positive.</P>
    <P>The total cancellation of debt in developing countries raises a number of difficult and complex questions. Debt alleviation cannot be considered in isolation. Issues such as internal conflict, corruption, poor governance and human rights abuses can sometimes play a part. It is natural that creditor governments, who will be expected to pay very substantial moneys in support of debt relief, will want assurances that resources are directed to the alleviation of poverty.</P>
    <P>Although not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries, Ireland strongly welcomes measures, be they through debt relief or debt cancellation, which serve to ease the burden. At a national level, we have mobilised IR£31 million to help relive the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries. We have contributed IR£9.5 mill<Col N="492" /> ion to debt relief in Tanzania and Mozambique, both of which are priority countries for Irish aid. Funds amounting to IR£22 million have been channelled through the World Bank and the IMF to finance the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>Apart from its strong support for reform of the HIPC initiative, the Government continues to argue for a generous and flexible approach to heavily indebted poor countries by creditor nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies. Ireland will continue to press for a vigorous and intensified programme to tackle this major obstacle to development.</P>

      <Quest>the input, if any, his Department has had into the preparation of the Irish position for the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle, having regard to the serious implications of issues being addressed for the developing countries; his views on the necessity for core labour standards and food security in developing countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's preparations for participation in the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, which is being held in Seattle this week, the Department of Foreign Affairs has been closely involved in these preparations.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 11 October 1999 reached agreement on conclusions for the EU's approach to the conference in Seattle and these conclusions were formally adopted on 26 October 1999. The conclusions propose a broad-based comprehensive round of trade negotiations, to be concluded within a period of three years. Such a comprehensive round offers the opportunity of achieving a broad range of objectives of benefit to all WTO members in terms of further liberalisation and expansion of trade, increased transparency and predictability and equal opportunities for all WTO members to obtain results on the basis of balanced negotiations. Ireland fully supports this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusions adopted last month attach special importance to ensuring that the new round responds to the particular interests and concerns of developing countries. It further holds that a development agenda be reflected in all areas of negotiation. In this context, agriculture in general and food security in particular will be key issues for developing countries. Together with many developed countries, we have been concerned about the effect of the Uruguay Round agreement on agriculture on net food <Col N="493" /> importing developing countries, particularly as regards basic cereal import bills. Since both food aid and subsidies declined substantially in the mid-1990s NFIDC s have faced higher food import bills. Their reliance on food imports means that they are by definition highly vulnerable in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the fact that these food security concerns were addressed in the WTO Marrakesh agreement, which provides mechanisms for periodically monitoring the levels of food aid, the adoption of guidelines to ensure a sufficient level of food aid in full grant form and for full consideration in donors' aid programmes of requests for the provision of technical and financial assistance to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure in least developed countries and net food importing developing countries. While advances have been made on the first two issues greater progress on the question of technical and financial assistance will be an important issue in the future round of negotiations.</P>
    <P>The review of the agreement on agriculture will provide an opportunity to address the concerns of developing countries taking into account the review of the operation of the agreement with regard to food security. I welcome the opportunity to deal with this important issue which is of crucial importance to many developing countries. Ireland will be encouraging a sympathetic response to the food security issues identified by developing countries during the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
    <P>In general agriculture will be among the most sensitive issues in the new round. This is a particularly sensitive matter for Ireland. Developing countries and Cairns group countries &ndash; major agricultural exporters, including Australia and New Zealand &ndash; have singled out the EU's agricultural policies as a key issue to be dealt with. It is essential for Ireland that the agreements reached in the framework of Agenda 2000 should not be tampered with in any way and we expect the support of the Commission and other member states on this.</P>
    <P>With regard to labour standards, the Council conclusions state that the WTO, in co-operation with other relevant international organisations, should encourage positive incentives to promote the observance of core labour rights. We recognise that this matter is highly sensitive for developing countries. The EU has proposed that a joint ILO-WTO standing working forum on trade, globalisation and labour issues be established to promote a better understanding of the issues involved through a substantive dialogue between all interested parties. In our view this is the most appropriate way to take this issue forward.</P>
    <P>One of the most important challenges in the new round will be to ensure that technical assistance is made available to developing countries to <Col N="494" /> such an extent that they are enabled to participate fully in whatever new arrangements emerge from the negotiations which have been launched this week in Seattle. As evidence of our seriousness in this regard the Department of Foreign Affairs has co-operated with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to assist, together with a number of other countries, in the establishment of an advisory centre in Geneva on WTO law for developing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be a founder member of the centre and we will contribute $2.25 million over five years to the centre. The centre will provide invaluable advice and assistance for developing countries &ndash; in particular the least developed &ndash;  in defending their trade rights and availing of the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO. In supporting this project we have underlined in a practical way our view that the millennium trade round should reflect closely the needs and interests of the developing world and should facilitate the integration of developing countries into the world trade system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to questions on East Timor on 2 November, the final withdrawal of Indonesian forces was completed at the end of October. Since then the security situation has improved further throughout the territory, including in the enclave of Oecussi, which is surrounded by West Timor. The INTERFET force continued to be built up and the total now numbers approximately 9,500. The Irish contingent with INTERFET is actively involved in the Suai area, which is close to the border with West Timor, and their performance has been recognised and is highly appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> While it would be premature to say that the threat from pro-integrationist militias has entirely disappeared, there has been a significant reduction in their activities in East Timor. The policy of the new Government of President Wahid in Jakarta is also taking effect in West Timor, with the result that there has a been a withdrawal of support by local Indonesian forces for the militias there. Some &ndash; but not all &ndash; of the militia leaders have called for the laying down of weapons and this has happened in a number of cases. Some militia members, and this probably concerns those who were reluctantly pressed into service, have indicated that they wish to return to East Timor. Such persons are subject to a special vetting process by INTERFET before being allowed to enter East Timor.</P>
    <P>There are, however, still hardline elements among the militias, particularly in West Timor. It remains unclear if they will join with other pro-integrationist leaders who are now debating on how they can be reconciled with Mr. Gusmao and his allies, or whether they will remain unreconciled. The situation may be clarified if the pro-integrationist elements succeed in organising a meeting to address all of these matters.</P>
    <P>The fate of refugees in West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia has been linked to the level of militia intimidation and interference. As a result of the reduced levels of militia activity, the flow of refugee returns has increased. While the process is not free of problems, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees calculates that close to 110,000 refugees have now returned, which according to its estimates would be approximately 70% of the total. The UNHCR signed a further agreement in late November with the Indonesian authorities to expedite the process. A visit by Vice-President Megawati to camps in West Timor last week is further seen as being helpful, although pressure will have to be maintained on the Indonesian government to ensure that its instructions are fully carried out at local level. In addition, some of the remaining refugees may have voted against independence, and they will no doubt require sufficient reassurances before making any decision about returning. Thus, even when the process is completed, there may be a residual number who will have opted to remain in Indonesia.</P>
    <P>Returning refugees are being given medical aid, food and other supplies to enable them to reconstruct their lives and homes. This work is taking place in the larger context of providing humanitarian assistance throughout the country, which still faces enormous tasks of reconstruction and rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The World Bank, accompanied by the European Commission, has also just made a study of requirements over the middle to longer term, and initial estimates indicated that $250 to $300 mill<Col N="496" /> ion will be required. A donors conference to address these findings and solicit pledges of assistance will take place in Japan later this month. For our part we will be examining the results of our own assessment mission to East Timor in order to see what best contribution we can make bilaterally to the reconstruction programme which is now under way.</P>
    <P>The UN Transitional Administration in East Timor &ndash; UNTAET &ndash; is also now in place and will be further developed, in accordance with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1272 of 25 October 1999. The mission of UNTAET will be to provide security, help with reconstruction and develop the capacity of the East Timorese for self-government and independence.</P>
    <P>The peacekeeping element of UNTAET will replace INTERFET, and this changeover is expected to take place around the end of January. Consultations are currently taking place with the UN on Ireland's contribution to the peacekeeping force.</P>
    <P>UNTAET is now recruiting personnel for the civil administration. While initially this will involve international personnel, the intention is to train East Timorese as quickly as possible. Whereas prior to the referendum on independence practically all senior positions in the administration were held by Indonesians, and these have now left, a large number of lesser positions were filled by East Timorese. UNTAET is now actively working to identify such persons, some of whom have been found among the refugees, and to persuade them to return to their positions.</P>
    <P>Another key component of UNTAET's work will be the installation and training of a police force and judicial system, since those which existed previously have entirely disappeared. In the interim, police work, the administration of justice and the safeguarding of human rights will be the responsibility of UNTAET.</P>
    <P>The wide-scale violations of human rights which took place both before and after the referendum are a matter for investigation by the commission established by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at the request of the UN Secretary General. This commission is to report to the Secretary General by the end of December. As part of its work, the commission recently visited East Timor. I understand that the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights has also been active in investigating such matters.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gusmao made clear when he visited Dublin that he is prepared to be reconciled with former adversaries, but that this had to take place on the basis of their acknowledgment of guilt and responsibility. These sentiments have also been expressed by Bishop Belo. I hope that the work of the UN special commission will make a positive contribution in this regard.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gusmao also indicated that he was prepared to work constructively with Indonesia, and <Col N="497" /> in that regard I am pleased to note that he visited Jakarta on 30 November and according to reports had a cordial meeting with President Wahid.</P>
    <P>While East Timor still faces many challenges, progress can be noted in a number of areas. UNTAET must now receive adequate support from the international community to achieve its goals. UNTAET must develop self-capacity on the part of the East Timorese people, and avoid the pitfalls which have arisen elsewhere of creating a dependency culture. East Timorese leaders must work for reconciliation among all the sectors of society and co-operate constructively with the international community. This should pave the way for elections to take place in East Timor at the earliest possible date, and East Timor's final progression towards independence. We look forward to the day when it will be possible to recognise East Timor as an independent country.</P>

      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned at the failure to resolve the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and at the continued delay in implementation of the OAU framework agreement, approved by the OAU summit in Algiers in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> The Government has conveyed its views about the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities under OAU mediation to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities on every possible occasion. I again raised our concerns about the situation during my recent meetings with Ugandan and Kenyan leaders in Kampala and in Nairobi last month. With our EU partners, we continue to urge Ethiopia and Eritrea to end all hostilities, proceed to the signature of a ceasefire agreement, subscribe immediately to the modalities, and fully implement the OAU framework agreement.</P>
    <P>We will continue to support all international efforts, notably those of the OAU and UN, vigorously to pursue the peace process and to achieve a comprehensive settlement to this futile conflict, the political and economic costs of which neither country can afford. The current situation is destabilising for both countries and for the wider region of East Africa and is having an unacceptable impact on civilian populations in human rights, humanitarian and social terms.</P>
    <P>We have also underlined our readiness to support the UN and the OAU in the implementation of the peace agreement. The UN has commenced the deployment of military liaison officers in the region and work is ongoing in New York in preparation for a UN peacekeeping force to assist the parties in implementing the agreement.</P>
    <P>With our partners, we have stressed the necessity of ensuring peaceful and permanent disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the militia groups currently operating in the region, with a view to promoting justice, national reconciliation and respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to support the work of the EU special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who is actively pursuing the Union's objectives through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures. We believe that the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region will help ensure lasting stability.</P>

      <P>No reliable figures are available regarding the numbers of Irish who may be living and or working in the United States without proper authorisation. Very rough estimates based on CSO calculations suggest that 3,000 to 4,000 of the Irish people who went to the US in each of the years 1994-95 and 1996-97 remained there illegally. However, the numbers of undocumented Irish people have fallen dramatically since the late 1980s and early 1990s because of the Morrison and Donnelly visa programmes which effectively solved the problem of the undocumented Irish in the US at that time.</P>
      <P>While anecdotal evidence from the voluntary Irish organisations suggests a small flow of new undocumented arrivals, similarly there are indications that more people, both legal and undocumented, are returning to Ireland as a result of the economic success that the country is experiencing. CSO migration estimates confirm that, for each of the three years to April 1999, the numbers of immigrants from the US were greater than the numbers of emigrants to the US.</P>

      <P>Ireland was represented at the summit in Istanbul by the Taoiseach. A total of 54 states participated in the summit, including almost all the European States , as well as the US and Canada.</P>
      <P>An important feature of the OSCE is that its decisions are achieved by consensus among its participating states. On this basis the summit agreed the Istanbul summit declaration and adopted the OSCE Charter for European Security. Copies of the Summit Declaration and the Charter for European Security have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The summit reviewed the OSCE's role in a range of conflict or potential conflict areas. In relation to Chechnya, Russia agreed that a political solution is essential and that the assistance of the OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal. Russia also agreed to a visit by the OSCE chairman in office to the region and joined with other delegations in reaffirming the mandate of the OSCE assistance group in Chechnya. However, I am deeply disappointed that, in the aftermath of the summit, Russia has not availed of OSCE assistance to try to resolve the conflict. I understand that the OSCE chairman in office, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, had to leave Moscow on Monday, 29 November without being able to fix a date for an OSCE mission to the region. Ireland would like to see an OSCE mission in Chechnya at the earliest possible date and we will continue to work closely with EU partners and within the OSCE towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Istanbul summit also reviewed the OSCE's role in the western Balkans and south-east Europe. The summit noted that the OSCE Mission in Kosovo is an essential part of the broader UN Mission and is playing a vital role in the process of rebuilding a multi-ethnic society. The summit pledged continuation of the OSCE's work for a democratic multi-ethnic Croatia and Bosnia and <Col N="502" /> Herzegovina and renewed its commitment to assist Albania in its social, political and economic reform process.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the OSCE Charter for European Security was an important outcome of the summit. The purpose of the new OSCE charter for European Security is to further develop the basic principles of the OSCE; to allow for the formal commitment to these principles by the successor states of the Soviet Union; and to strengthen the operational role of the OSCE as a regional security organisation under the United Nations charter. The charter also sets out a vision of how the OSCE can cooperate with other international organisations and institutions in promoting security and co-operation in Europe. Ireland made a significant contribution to reaching agreement in this area.</P>
    <P>The summit was also the occasion for the signing of the adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, known as the CFE Treaty. The original CFE Treaty in 1990 was a very significant arms limitation treaty, signed by the members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In Istanbul the same signatories recommitted themselves to limiting conventional weapons, taking into account the very wide changes in European security architecture since 1990. Like other neutral countries in Europe, Ireland is not a signatory of this Treaty.</P>

      <P>The combination of the two cyclones which hit the Indian State of Orissa in less than two weeks resulted in severe damage. In particular, the super cyclone of 29 October was ravaging in its duration and intensity. Winds reaching up to 260 kph and 20 foot tidal waves flattened buildings, trees and utility poles, causing massive destruction and washing away the mud homes of hundreds of thousands. Current estimates put the death toll at over 9,800 with over 3,000 people injured. The devastation caused by the cyclones has affected the lives of millions. Not only have thousands been left homeless but their livelihoods have also been affected. Over 1.7 million hectares of crops were destroyed and some 400,000 livestock perished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial relief effort was hampered by the communications breakdown, making even preliminary information concerning damage and casualties difficult to obtain. The situation has improved dramatically in the last few weeks. The waters have receded and all major routes are now accessible, allowing for assessments and recovery operations to proceed. The Government of India and the state of Orissa, UN agencies and NGOs are now co-ordinating efforts to assist the cyclone <Col N="504" /> affected populations. The Indian Government is allocating thousands of tonnes of rice to both affected families and those NGOs operating free kitchens. It is also supplying non-food items such as plastic sheeting, blankets, and clothes. The health situation is, at present, considered to be under control, but is being monitored constantly. Additional medical staff have been deployed to the area. The UN have reported that there are, at present, adequate stocks of medicines in Orissa.</P>
    <P>In the days following the cyclone, Ireland provided IR£200,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance. This money was channelled through the UN and through Irish NGOs operational on the ground. The money is being used to supply and deliver relief packs containing food, cooking utensils and temporary shelter items as well as providing cooked meals to the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The European Union, on behalf of the member states has also responded generously. The European Commission, via the European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; has provided grants totalling two million euros for emergency shelter, ready-to-eat food, essential medicines and water purification equipment.</P>
    <P>The people of Orissa now face the formidable task of reconstruction. Assessments continue, but recent information indicates that at least 1 million houses have been destroyed, and this number could increase to 1.7 million. Communications and electricity systems in most areas are completely destroyed, and will take many months to repair. The federal Government of India has promised all possible assistance to Orissa to help rebuild it and State officials are already working on plans for the repair of roads and the building of houses. The UN has been operational in the area for some time now and is now increasing their operations in response to this latest crisis. Additional resources are being ploughed into existing programmes in order to meet rehabilitation and reconstruction needs.</P>

      <P>Community Employment &ndash; CE &ndash; is a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. The primary focus of the programme is the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the open labour market. Participants on the programme take up part-time employment with a sponsor for a period of one to three years without losing their secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance &ndash; BTWA &ndash; is available to persons who have completed their CE programme and to other unemployed persons and lone parents who are in a position to take up employment or self-employment. Both CE and BTWA are schemes designed to prepare individuals for work in the open labour market. It would not be appropriate to combine use of these schemes in a manner which would reduce the incentives available to work in the open labour market and thereby impede the transition to work by the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>BTWA participants are paid 75% of their existing social welfare payment for the first year, 50% for the second year and 25% for the third year along with their earnings. In addition, they retain their secondary benefits. In this way individuals can retain their secondary benefits for a period of up to six years and BTWA acts as an incentive to take up employment and is furthering the aims of the CE programme.</P>

The mission is the OSCE's largest and when fully deployed will have between six and seven hundred personnel, including both local employees and international staff stationed in various centres throughout Kosovo. The mission is headed by a Dutch national, Ambassador Daan Everts, who was previously Head of the OSCE Presence in Albania.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of November the mission had 460 personnel deployed. As its operation expands it will gradually take on more staff until it reaches full deployment. Currently Ireland has eight staff with the mission. Four are members of the Defence Forces and the others are civilians either on secondment by the Government or specialists on contract to the mission. As the mission gets larger more personnel will be required and it is my intention to continue to respond positively to requests for seconded staff from the OSCE.</P>

      <P>The Government, in co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world. A steady flow of information is available from many sources including local embassies, United Nations rapporteurs and working groups, the Commission on Human Rights and non-governmental organisations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it takes consistent and painstaking effort to bring about improvements in human rights situations. I have provided detailed information to the House in my replies to other questions on specific cases of human rights violations. There are signs of progress in some areas, and I have to say that we would like to see more.</P>
      <P>A particular mechanism which the European Union is pursuing is human rights dialogue with a number of countries. The dialogue between the EU and China has been continuing for some time and the most recent meeting took place on 19 October 1999. The Chinese authorities have taken some positive steps over the past two years which have given rise to hopes of a tangible improvement in the human rights situation there. These have included China's increased co-operation with UN human rights mechanisms &ndash; for example the signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the visits by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Through the human rights dialogue, China now regularly discusses issues of serious human rights concern, including individual cases, the death penalty, conditions of detention and Tibet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A most recent notable development has been the arrival last Thursday of a five-person UN human rights team in Dili to begin its investigation into human rights violations committed in East Timor. The question of returning refugees from West Timor is a crucial issue which involves approximately 230,000 people. The UNHCR has requested increased access to these refugees and the Indonesian Government should be encour<Col N="509" /> aged to speed up repatriation of East Timorese wishing to return to East Timor. I also understand that the Indonesian Human Rights Commission has begun its own investigation into the events in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The human rights situations in several individual countries were raised by the EU at the recent session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which deals with social and human rights issues. The EU introduced resolutions on the human rights situations in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Iraq and Iran which were all adopted during the 54th session which ended on the 22 November last.</P>

      <P>The financial crisis which has affected the United Nations for a number of years now is primarily the result of the failure of certain member states, notably the United States, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time in accordance with their obligations under the charter. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
      <P>The US is the major debtor, owing roughly two-thirds of the total arrears due to the United Nations and any improvement in its arrears situation would ease the situation considerably. During my visit to the UN General Assembly in September, I joined my EU colleagues in raising the matter with Secretary of State Albright. The United States administration has very recently put forward a plan agreed with Congress to deal with the arrears problem. While the repayment amount proposed in the plan is substantially less than the total arrears owed by the US, negotiations on the matter are under way at the United Nations.</P>

      <Quest>if her Department has completed its research into the pension arrangements of former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; if, further to Parliamentary Question 87 of 30 June 1999, she will examine the circumstances of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11, and others in similar circumstances, given that he has suffered less favourable pension arrangements after the establishment of Telecom Éireann in 1983; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As stated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 87 of 30 June 1999, policy administration in relation to superannuation arrangements of former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who transferred to Telecom Éireann on vesting day is essentially a matter for the company.</P>
      <P>I am advised that it is the current policy of Eircom that pensions are linked to increases granted to appropriate serving staff. I understand that the case referred to by the Deputy arises from a grade restructuring which took place in May 1987. The person referred to had retired in September 1986 and feels that he did not receive an increase in his pension entitlement because of the grade restructuring. My Department had, following representations from the Deputy, taken this matter up with the company some time ago. A response is still awaited but I have arranged to have the matter raised with the company again. I will let the Deputy have a response in due course.</P>

    <P>Newly commissioned officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are not obliged to sign a contract on commissioning. They may retire or resign their commissions without expense unless they have signed an undertaking to refund the <Col N="513" /> cost of courses completed outside Defence Forces establishments or in respect of pilot training in the case of Air Corps officers. Officers who are assigned to attend third level courses on full pay are required to sign undertakings that they will refund the cost of the course, including their remuneration while a full time student. Undertakings run from the date of completion of a course and officers who retire or resign with the permission of the Minister before the expiration of an undertaking are required to make the appropriate refunds to the Department in respect of the cost to the State of their participation in such educational courses or training.</P>
    <P>The scales of payment for the &ldquo;discharge by purchase&rdquo; of non-commissioned officers and privates are as prescribed in Defence Forces Regulations A10 which are on view in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Broadly similar criteria apply to non-commissioned officers and privates, as to officers, in relation to undertakings in respect of educational and training courses.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): The payment of additional levy for excess supply of milk or milk equivalent is provided for under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92. Article 2.1 of that regulation states, <i>inter alia</i>, that additional levy shall be shared between the producers who contributed to the overrun. The adjustment of delivery levels to cater for butterfat content is set down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 536/93, as amended.</P>
    <P>The totals of actual and fat adjusted milk deliveries are compared at the end of each milk quota year and the levy liability is calculated on the greater of the two figures provided that that quantity is also greater than the national quota.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the EU regulations on the quota regime under which super levy penalties may be paid by national Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> An analysis carried out by my Department shows that prices paid to sheep producers in Ireland tends to be among the lowest in the EU. It is also clear that a single EU wide premium fails to reflect the disparity in prices and therefore, even allowing for differences between production systems and meat yields in member states, does not support the income of producers in an equitable manner throughout the Union.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions pointed out to the EU Commission both within the Council of Ministers and in bilateral discussions the deficiencies in the sheepmeat regime in this respect raised the matter most recently at the November Agriculture Council. I have outlined the serious income situation facing sheep producers and the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers because of the lack of convergence of prices across the European Union. In particular, I have requested the Commissioner to take urgent action to address these issues, including by way of the temporary suspension of the stabiliser or through the payment of a supplementary premium in member states where prices are significantly below the EU average. Apart from the United Kingdom, there is no support from other member states. As far as the extensification premium is concerned, I have also raised this matter with the Commission on a number of occasions in recent years.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler has indicated that he intends to review the current sheepmeat regime next year. The direction and focus of that review will be highly significant.</P>
    <P>Finally I wish to point out that a total of £130 million will be paid to Irish sheep producers in EU premia and headage payments in 1999.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to the proposed allocation of 20.5 million gallons of milk under Agenda 2000, young farmers will be considered as eligible recipients of extra milk quotas even if they were not personally in production in the relevant production years on dairy family farms where land and milk quotas are transferred before the termination of the early retirement scheme in 1999; if it is the case that potential eligible participants in the early retirement scheme should defer their application in order to obtain additional milk quota under the proposed allocation; if due consideration will be given to these types of cases in view of the fact the current early retirement scheme is due to terminate in December 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of the 20 million gallons negotiated under the Agenda 2000 Agreement is split between the general 15 <Col N="517" /> million gallons available to producers who satisfy certain criteria and five million gallons aimed specifically at younger farmers.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for an additional allocation from the five million gallons directed towards younger dairy farmers already in milk production, an applicant must have taken over the holding by 13 October 1999, the date of my announcement on the distribution of the additional quota.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an allocation from the 15 million gallons, one requirement is that eligible producers must be active suppliers during the current milk quota year. If the holding is transferred to another person, the entitlement to the additional quota allocation will be transferred to the transferee unless that person is already entitled to an allocation from the 15 million gallons reserve.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for a total of 60.54 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area of 60.06 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.48 hectares or 0.8% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore in this case no penalty is applied and consequently any payments due will issue based on the determined area of 60.06h.</P>

      <P>The person named amended his 1999 area aid application on 5 May 1999 to include two new plots. While he was permitted to add the plots in order to bring his area aid application into line with his REPS plan it was not permissible under the EU regulations concerned to add them to his forage area for 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, however, necessary to enter the two new plots on the Departments electronic database to facilitate cross-checking with the area claimed in <Col N="518" /> his REPS plan. This process has now been completed.</P>
    <P>The application from the person concerned is a complex one involving eleven different land parcels, five of which are commonage shares. The total forage area determined in this case is 24.52 hectares made up of eight eligible parcels. One of the five commonage shares claimed &ndash; 0.68 hectares &ndash; was excluded because proof of entitlement was not submitted. When that proof is submitted by the person concerned the determined area can then be adjusted. However, since the parcel concerned represents less than 3% of the eligible area no penalty is involved and the payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the issues referred to by the Deputy relate, among other matters, to an underpayment of PAYE arising from an over allowance of mortgage interest relief for the years 1997-98 and 1998-99. The inspector of taxes had decided to collect the underpayments by restricting the taxpayers' tax-free allowances for the year 1999-00. The taxpayers in question wrote to the Revenue's customer services policy unit in April 1999 outlining their concerns regarding the issues now raised by the Deputy. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners issued a comprehensive response to the taxpayers on these issues in June 1999, and also invited the taxpayers to contact them for further clarification, if required. Until the receipt of the correspondence enclosed with the Depu<Col N="519" /> ty's question, the commissioners were not aware that the taxpayers were still dissatisfied with their response. The issues are now being re-examined in detail by Revenue's director of customer services who will issue a further response and will also be available to meet with the taxpayers to discuss their concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer to whom the Deputy refers was prosecuted in his local District Court on 28 July 1999 and was fined a total of £3,000 for failure to submit income tax returns for the years 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95 during which he was self-employed. Prior to the prosecution, Revenue had written to the taxpayer twice each year and had made personal calls on three occasions to attempt to contact him with regard to outstanding returns. Although the prosecution was for failure to deliver income tax returns beginning with the tax year 1992-93, the taxpayer has not delivered income tax returns since 1989-90 and has also failed to deliver VAT returns for a number of years prior to the time he ceased trading. The taxpayer finally contacted Revenue by telephone on 9 February 1999 and undertook to contact his accountant to arrange delivery of all outstanding returns. None of the returns has been delivered to date.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by Revenue that, on imposing the fines, the District Court judge directed that the taxpayer be given two months in which to pay and imposed a five day jail sentence in default of payment.</P>
      <P>The collection of the fines or the enforcement of a jail sentence is not a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. The Deputy will be aware in this context that it is the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are involved in this process.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners may in their discretion mitigate a fine by up to 50% in certain circumstances. No request for mitigation has been received. However, even if full mitigation was granted in this case, fines totalling £1,500 would still have to be paid by the taxpayer to avoid the jail sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards outstanding liabilities the taxpayer continues to owe tax for the years prior to 1989-<Col N="520" /> 90 and was making some payments up to early 1995. When he ceased trading he obtained employment locally and his tax free allowances in respect of that employment have been restricted to collect £750 per annum of the outstanding tax.</P>
    <P>The only suggestion I can make to the Deputy at this stage is that if the taxpayer requests mitigation of the fine it will be looked at sympathetically. At the same time, if he contacts his local inspector of taxes to finally establish the extent of his liabilities, the inspector may be able to assist in determining an appropriate schedule of payments.</P>

      <P>The paediatric dermatology service at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, includes the provision of care for children affected by epidermolysis bullosa &ndash; EB. The hospital has identified a need for the further development of its dermatology service which includes the provision of continued support services for children affected by epidermolysis bullosa with particular emphasis on the role of the EB nurse specialist. It has submitted a proposal to my Department in this regard.</P>
      <P>This proposal, which is linked to a proposal from St. James's Hospital for the development of its dermatology service in terms of joint consultant appointments, is under consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am providing Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children with funding for the development of its dermatology services in 2000. The Deputy will appreciate however, that it is a matter for the agency concerned to determine its staffing requirements in terms of its service priorities.</P>

      <Quest>the number of new residential places, respite places and day places being created in view of the announcement made in the 1999 budget regarding additional places for people with learning disabilities; where the new places were created; the agencies by which the new places were created; and the total cost of the new places.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million  in 2000, for the development of services to persons with an intellectual disability. In addition to the new residential, respite and day services, this funding has also enabled the health related support services for children with autism to be enhanced, the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements to be continued, and additional specialist and other support services to be provided. This funding was in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
      <P>The eight regional health boards were notified of the additional funding for new services in their determination of health expenditure for 1999 which issued from my Department in December 1998. The details of the precise services to be put in place in the health board regions were agreed with the regional intellectual disability co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for the health board regions.</P>
      <P>Details of the proposed number of new places and their locations are included in the following table. My Department has now requested confirmation from the boards as to the exact number of places which have been put in place this year. They have also been asked to give details of the agencies providing these services and their location. I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major element of the additional funding made available to my Department in the budget for 2000 relates to the capital and revenue investment necessary to accelerate the process of putting in place the new services required to meet the identified needs of this population group.</P>

      <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families. I am pleased to say that the <Col N="525" /> Government has decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one-third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical claims being made on behalf of products containing St John's Wort, <i>hypericum perforatum</i> require that, in this country, in common with other countries in the European Union, they be regarded as a medicinal products. Such <Col N="526" /> products therefore need product authorisations in order that they may be lawfully placed on the market.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland and under Directive 65/65/EEC it is required to establish proof of quality, safety and efficacy before granting access to the market for medicinal products. Following an application for a product authorisation earlier this year, and having carried out a medical assessment, the medicines board has recently formed the opinion that products containing St John's Wort should be subject to prescription-only control and a recommendation in that regard was made to my Department. The criteria on which such decisions are based are included in EU Council Directive 92/26/EEC concerning the classifications for supply of medicinal products for human use and in forming its opinion, the board would have had regard to those criteria. A number of reasons has been given by the board for its recommendation. These include the fact that the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs. These products must therefore be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients therefore may be at risk from hypertension, increased blood pressure, if these products were to be taken with certain other antidepressants, over-the-counter cough mixtures, sympathomimetics, and with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. Furthermore, the board has expressed concern at the possible treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self diagnosis and self medication are inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the placing of any medicinal product under prescription-only control is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice. While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns regarding costs, public health considerations must take precedence. From 1 January 2000, medicinal products containing St. John's Wort will be available from the usual outlets for prescription-only medicines.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a person (details supplied) in County Meath who is completing a diploma in 2000 and wishes to pur sue the optional fourth year degree programme in nursing; if he will provide the necessary funding through the health boards by way of grant for these students; his views on the suggestion that, if this type of funding is not made available, these and other prospective nursing students will not join the profession; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the one-year full-time degree course which the National University of Ireland, Galway is offering to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programmes.</P>
      <P>The position is that successful completion by a student of the three-year nursing registration/ diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse. Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification. A student who successfully completes the three-year diploma programme and who wishes to undertake a fourth year of full-time study leading to the award of a degree in nursing would, therefore, be responsible for making his or her own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. I am not in a position to provide funding for such a course.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a recommendation made by the Commission on Nursing, I have established a nursing education forum to prepare a strategy for moving pre-registration nursing education to a four-year degree programme in time for the intake of student nurses in the year 2002. The commission makes it clear in its report that &ldquo;No third-level institute or discipline should commence the programme prior to the agreed date.&rdquo;  In making this point, the commission was concerned that for a third-level institute or discipline to do otherwise &ldquo;would result in a recurrence of many of the difficulties encountered in the transition to the registration-diploma programme&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a highly successful outcome to this year's competitions for training places on the nursing-registration diploma programmes. A total of 1,215 training places were filled: 812 in general nursing, 254 in psychiatric nursing and 149 in mental handicap nursing. This is the largest number of direct entrants to nurse training for several years and proves that there continues to be considerable interest among young people and others in nursing as a career. I provided funding of almost £400,000 for both national and local recruitment campaigns and I regard it as money well spent. It is especially pleasing that the promotional campaigns have raised the profile of both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. <Col N="528" /> This year we succeeded in filling a record 254 training places in psychiatric nursing compared with only 92 places last year, and a record 149 places in mental handicap nursing compared with 117 in 1998. Funding for some 100 extra training places in general and psychiatric nursing was also made available this year. In view of the success of this year's recruitment campaign, I am allocating further funding totalling £360,000 to the various schools of nursing to enable them to undertake similar promotional work in advance of next year's competition.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local government fund was established on 1 January, 1999. In accordance with the Local Government Act, 1998, it is financed by an exchequer contribution and motor tax receipts <Col N="529" /> and driver licensing fees and is to be used solely for local government and local government related expenditure purposes. The fund was established to provide local authorities with increased resources for general discretionary expenditure and non-national road spending. The projected increase in revenue from motor taxation and driver licensing fees, net of running costs, from 1998 to 1999 is £48 million, 15.6%. The recently announced allocations to local authorities for general expenditure during 2000 consist of a standard increase of 4% on 1999 allocations together with a further provision in respect of specific demands faced by local authorities. These allocations of £339.3 million are 4.8% higher than the corresponding 1999 allocations. A further allocation to local authorities from the local government fund in respect of non-national roads during 2000 will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Currently, allocations from the local government fund broadly reflect the existing and historic patterns of local authority expenditure. A major step towards a more equitable system of financial allocations to local authorities will be taken during the coming year with the introduction of a distribution model based on a comprehensive analysis of local authority needs and resources. This initial model will be further refined over time and will provide the basis for future allocations from the local government fund.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the NDP provides the strategic framework, and the funding, to ensure the development of a high quality road network in the Border area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NDP provides for a total investment of £4.7 billion in national road improvement and maintenance over the period 2000-06, a threefold increase on the 1994-99 period. The NDP also sets out a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the coming seven years. This framework provides for major improvements on a number of national primary routes, N2, N3, N13-N15, N16, which <Col N="530" /> serve the Border area and which are also major cross-Border routes.</P>
    <P>The NDP also provides for improvements on key national secondary routes which are of particular importance for economic and regional development; and the evaluation over the period 2000-06 of the need for the development of new routes to augment these mentioned in the NDP. Where the need for a new route is established, funding will be provided for the advance planning and design of the route in the plan period, with a view to bringing the project to construction within an appropriate timeframe.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter for the NRA, within the framework of the NDP, to promote a more detailed programming of the work required on the national road network and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
    <P>The improvement of cross-Border road links is also a priority of the non-national road programme. Over the period 1994-99 a total of £983 million will have been invested in the non-national road network. The NDP provides for £1.6 billion to be invested in non-national roads, of which in the order of £702 million is expected to be invested in the Border, midland and western region.</P>
    <P>The key objectives of non-national roads expenditure in the Border Midland and Western region in this period will be to complete the restoration programme to restore all non-national roads in county council areas by the end of 2005 and to assist all roads authorities to improve the non-national network, including cross-border and border roads, through the provision of grants under various categories, in a manner which supports the economic and social development of the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>This Government has signalled its commitment to the development of sport and recreational facilities by increasing the funding for capital expenditure for this purpose, by more than 350%, from £8.5 million in 1997 to £39.4 million in the Estimates for the year 2000. This increase includes provision for a trebling in funding for the sports capital programme from £5 million in 1997 to £15 million in 2000; a fourfold increase in the provision for the swimming pool programme from £3.5 million in 1997 to £15 million in 2000; almost £6 million towards the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool and £20 million support towards the development of Croke Park, the final £6 million of which is due for payment in 2000.</P>
      <P>Following an application process earlier this year under the sports capital programme, allocations totalling some £18 millions have been made in 1999 to some 400 local community based projects and to a number of national and regional projects throughout the country. Provision is being made in the multi-annual estimates for the continuation of the programme at 1999 levels in 2000 and 2001. I have also secured an increase in funding of £36 million over the next three years for the swimming pool programme &ndash; from £3 million in 1999 to £15 million per annum for the next three years.</P>
      <P>Fingal County Council has recently completed a feasibility study on the provision of an indoor athletics training facility adjacent to the existing athletics facilities at Morton stadium, which is prioritised in the recently published review of the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan announced last week, financial assistance amounting to £85 million will be available over the seven years of the plan to support the development of sport and recreational facilities by local authorities, particularly in areas which lack them and for voluntary groups developing multi-sport and recreational facilities where no such facilities currently exist.</P>
      <P>Schemes now operating since 1 July under the aegis of the Sports Council and the national governing bodies of the olympic sports were allocated over £2.5 million towards their activities this year, and a further £1 million has been allocated to their elite athletes-players under the international carding scheme which comprises individual grants as well as access to medical support, sports science services and career counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> The Sports Council also provides funding to the National Coaching and Training Centre for the development and enhancement of coaching in Ireland as well as for the provision of physiological, scientific, medical and other related services to elite individual competitors and squads.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's ongoing commitment to the development and support of sport, I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that an additional £1 million has been made available in this year's budget to the newly established Sports Council towards the costs associated with the preparation and participation of the Irish olympic and paralympic teams in the 2000 Sydney Games.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any study which compares the range of facilities available here and the various other supports which exist for our elite sports persons with those in other EU countries. I am satisfied, however, that there is now under way an ambitious programme of state assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

The particular needs of all counties, including County Kildare, are being considered in the formulation of this plan. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service by the end of a five-year developmental period beginning in 1999. I am happy to inform you that as part of the first phase of the expansion, the Civil Service Commission has completed interviews for an additional 25 psychologists and has also completed the short-listing for a further 25 psychologists. The successful applicants from the first competition will begin to take up their positions in the National Educational Psychological Service Agency early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group which I set up last year to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals in primary schools was recently presented to me.</P>
      <P>There is of course already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions. The middle management structures in schools which have been developed in recent years enable the principal to delegate a number of functions to other teachers. In particular, many schools have access to secretarial and caretaking services, and I have recently announced substantial improvements in the level of assistance in these areas.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year.</P>
      <P>There are various recommendations which impact on the terms and conditions of teachers which should, as envisaged in the report be pursued through the relevant industrial relations machinery, particularly as cross-sectoral impacts must be considered.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need for further supports for our primary schools and for principals in carrying out their roles. However, these can only be introduced in the context of the full range of issues facing primary education and normal industrial relations procedures. I have recently held discussions on these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1 January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the <Col N="543" /> students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
    <P>The schemes further provide that maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college, which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that the student to whom the Deputy refers was not aged 23 years on 1 January 1997, the year he commenced his third level studies, and that his normal residence is less than 15 miles from the college that he is attending. Accordingly, on the basis of the reckonable income of the candidate and his parents, he was correctly awarded a maintenance grant at the adjacent rate.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Britway national school, County Cork, has no remedial teaching service; his views on whether his Department's offer of a grant of £15 per week to secure this service is not adequate; if he will provide the necessary service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>From September of this year, I have extended the remedial teaching service to every primary school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with a pupil teacher ratio below 10:1 are free to make a case for support to my Department.</P>
      <P>This development has resulted in the allocation of an additional 165 full-time remedial teacher posts or post equivalents in part-time hour allocations. Wherever possible, the extension of the service was achieved through the allocation of full-time posts to individual schools or to groups of schools on a shared basis. However, in some cases involving smaller schools, including the school in question, it was not possible to arrange a local clustering arrangement. In these cases, an allocation of part-time hours was made to the school. The level of allocation in each case reflected the size of the school and was based on the recommendations of the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>In the case of the school to which the Deputy refers, my Department has approved the appointment of a teacher to deliver three hours remedial tuition per week. The present rate of payment in respect of this service is £17.40 per hour. My Department also funds any employer's PRSI contribution involved in such cases.</P>
      <P>The school has not notified my Department of any difficulty in respect of its remedial teaching allocation.</P>
