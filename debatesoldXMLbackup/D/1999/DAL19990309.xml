      <P>In welcoming the publication of the first edition of Partnership at Work, the bulletin of the National Centre for Partnership, in January of this year, I acknowledged the valuable contribution which social partnership has made to this country. In the first edition, which has been circulated to all Deputies, I also stressed the need for a much deeper partnership between employers and their workforces, particularly at enterprise level. With greater competition and the ever increasing rate of change in the modern world, an agreed union-management framework within which to respond to these issues in a non-adversarial manner is essential.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the National Centre for Partnership has been actively engaged in pursuing its work programme, in conjunction with IBEC and ICTU, to promote the partnership approach in both the public and private sectors. The work programme for 1999 includes the provision of seminars and workshops to disseminate best practice and also training for managers, union representatives and employees. The bulletin highlights the specific initiatives that are now under way.</P>
      <P>The bulletin is an important source of information on the development of partnership in Ireland and is a central element in the communications strategy of the centre in implementing its work programme. I wish the centre continued success with its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for circulating the bulletin, Partnership at Work, the publi<Col N="1214" /> cation of which I welcome. In his article in the bulletin, he stated that there is still a need for greater partnership between employers and their workforces at enterprise level. Given that in his reply to my question the Taoiseach stated that he wishes the centre every success, does he intend to follow through on that? Has he abandoned his traditional role of trying to foster that partnership or will that role be now filled by the centre? If the latter is the case, does the centre have a timeframe within which it must complete its work?</P>

      <P>The National Centre for Partnership, which was established under Partnership 2000, has worked with the trade unions and employers to develop a work programme which has the Government's support. I am satisfied the programme, funding for which has allowed the centre to hold seminars and conferences aimed at bringing unions and employers together, is working well and is promoting consideration of best practice and best concepts. During the past year there has been a significant development of partnership activities in the public and private sectors. By the end of this year we will have seen the single biggest growth in new management-trade union-employee structures in all sectors of the economy since the foundation of the State. The Government's job is not to interfere but to help the centre and work with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the centre is not obliged to produce a regular report. Will a form of accountability other than stating that the Taoiseach is satisfied with its work be introduced in respect of the centre? Will the rest of us be made privy to the basis on which that satisfaction is based in the form of some type of report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The centre is accountable in the form of its board, the membership of which includes a number of eminent people working in this area, and a liaison committee. Both the board and the committee are responsible for reporting to the Government under Partnership 2000. Last year they issued a report and I believe they intend to continue to issue reports on an annual basis.</P>

      <P>There are six bodies reporting to my Department. They are: the National Economic and Social Council; the National Economic and Social Forum; the National Centre for Partnership; the Information Society Commission; the National Statistics Board and the National Millennium Committee. Details of the work of these bodies and where relevant, their reports are laid <Col N="1215" /> out in the schedule which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my recent answers to previous parliamentary questions in these matters, particularly Questions Nos. 1 and 2 of 10 February 1999 and Question No. 64 of 24 November 1998.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P>NESC &ndash; National Economic and Social Council &ndash; appointed in November 1998, has been meeting on a monthly basis since then. At the request of the Government, the main work of the council during 1999 will relate to the preparation of a new strategy report to provide a basis for a national agreement in succession to Partnership 2000. Also, the NESC secretariat is working on a study benchmarking Irish progress in the areas covered by the Partnership 2000 agreement both over time and by comparison with other countries. The subject matter includes work on education, taxation and child care. Some of the material in the benchmarking exercise will be drawn upon for the strategic review. It is intended that the results of the research will be published later in 1999.</P>
      <P>NESF &ndash; National Economic and Social Forum &ndash; was established by the Government in 1993 as an advisory body to contribute to the formation of a wider national consensus on economic and social policy, particularly to combat social exclusion. Its mandate was renewed in 1995 and in 1997. The newly constituted NESF will focus on the detailed monitoring of initiatives taken in the context of social partnership, especially with regard to social exclusion and long-term unemployment. The newly constituted forum held its inaugural meeting on 12 November 1998.</P>
      <P>Regarding reports published in the past 12 months; in November and December 1997, prior to its mandate being renewed, the forum produced two reports and two opinions.</P>
      <P>The <i>reports </i>were: Second Periodic Report on the Work of the Forum &ndash; November 1997 and A Framework for Partnership &ndash; Enriching Strategic Consensus Through Participation &ndash; November 1997.</P>
      <P>The <i>Opinions </i>were: Development of the Equality Provisions &ndash;  November 1997; Targeted Employment and Training Measures &ndash;  November 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Society Commission reports to the Taoiseach. The commission is an advisory body whose main function is to monitor and advise Government on the development of an information society in Ireland. One of the most important of the commission's tasks is to raise awareness amongst the general public and industry of the opportunities and <Col N="1216" /> benefits offered by the information society. The commission has established six advisory groups to assist it in its work. These groups cover awareness, infrastructure, learning, enterprise, legal issues and Government services and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The National Centre for Partnership is actively pursuing a work programme to achieve its role, as described in Partnership 2000, of promoting the partnership approach in both the public and private sectors. This involves the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. The recently published magazine of the centre, Partnership at Work, sets out the specific initiatives under way. The centre is not required to produce regular reports.</P>
    <P>The National Millennium Committee reports to the Government. It was established to advise on proposed projects of national significance for inclusion in the Government's millennium programme and also on a scheme for supporting projects at a local level, including in areas of social disadvantage. The committee meets on a monthly basis. The chairman of the committee, Deputy Séamus Brennan, Chief Whip, recently made a progress report on the work of the committee to the Government and intends submitting further reports on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The National Statistics Board operates on the basis of five-year strategic plans. The most recent plan, Strategy for Statistics, 1998-2002, was published in September 1998. The board meets regularly to assess progress. Each year, the board reports on the progress made by the CSO in implementing the board's strategic plan. Currently, the board is drafting its 1998 annual report. While a specific deadline has not been set for its finalisation it is expected to be presented to Government and published by July 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ensure there is a work programme in place. Given the importance of its work in terms of the Partnership 2000 report, chapter 11 of which calls on it to monitor social exclusion, does the Taoiseach consider it satisfactory that there has been only one meeting of the NESF in the last 12 months? Will he ensure the bodies working under the aegis of his Department meet regularly and are held to account in discharging their functions? </P>

      <P>There are 19 staff working in my Department on secondment from other Government Departments. Details of the work they are doing at my Department and the names of their parent Departments are included in the schedule which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Only five of the 19 are in receipt of a shift allowance. The current total annual cost of the shift allowance, which is equivalent to one sixth of their salary, is £14,868.69. These officers are based in the communications unit which is operational 18 hours a day. This, understandably, necessitates the operation of a flexible rota of three different work shifts: 6 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.; 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight.</P>

      <P>Five are serving in the communications unit &ndash; one each from the following Departments: Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Central Statistics Office; Public Enterprise, and Finance.</P>
      <P>The following members of my personal staff are on secondment for the lifetime of the current Government: my private secretary is on secondment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Government press secretary is on secondment from the Department of Finance; the administrator of my constituency office is on secondment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and four persons are appointed as personal assistants &ndash; one each from the following Departments: Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Agriculture and Food; Finance, and Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I dealt comprehensively in the House recently with all the issues arising from my interview with the <i>Sunday Times</i> several weeks ago. I do not intend to run over the same ground again.</P>
      <P>I will depart for San José in the United States on 11 March where I will commence my programme of engagements for the St. Patrick's Day period. While in San José I will meet representatives of companies which have significant operations here. I will attend an IDA Ireland lunch and the launch by Enterprise Ireland of its new Silicon Valley network as well as the Spirit of Ireland awards dinner.</P>
      <P>On 14 March I will attend the St. Patrick's Day parade in San Francisco which will be followed by a lunch at the United Irish Cultural Centre. Before departing for Washington I will deliver an address at the Commonwealth Club of California. While in Washington I anticipate meeting senior figures in the US Administration. I will have a meeting with Senator Kennedy and The Friends of Ireland in the House of Representatives. On the evening of Tuesday, 16 March, after attending the official opening of Doyle's Hotel on New Hampshire Avenue, I will attend the American Ireland Fund dinner.</P>
      <P>On St. Patrick's Day, in accordance with tradition and established practice, I will meet President Clinton at the White House and subsequently attend a dinner hosted by Speaker Hastert on Capitol Hill. I will participate in a number of receptions, including the White House reception. I will also participate in various media events. On Thursday, 18 March, I will chair a meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board after which I will return to Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are no plans in the programme for a formal meeting with Senator Mitchell, but it is possible that if he is in Washington I shall have the pleasure of meeting him. He put so much time and effort into bringing about a peaceful accommodation on the island. We all owe him so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all extremely grateful for the engagement and support of the United States Administration throughout the process, including the key role played by Senator Mitchell as talks chairman. President Clinton has made it clear that he remains available to help in any way he can as opportunities arise. We are grateful for that assurance and shall be alert to every opening for his constructive involvement, not least in coming weeks. In the meantime it is vital that the two <Col N="1220" /> Governments and all the parties to the Agreement continue to work intensively to get over current difficulties. If we all put our hearts and minds to it, we can make the necessary progress in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Blair in Bonn on Friday, 26 February. I am reporting in a reply to a subsequent parliamentary question on the European and international issues on which we focused. On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister and I discussed progress in implementing the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, including the establishment of the North-South implementation bodies and the finalisation of legislation to establish them. Following an intensive programme of work we have now concluded the necessary four treaties. We are now in a position to proceed with the necessary legislation. In this regard the British-Irish Agreement Bill, 1999, which provides for implementation bodies covering inland waterways, food safety, trade and business developments, special EU programmes, language, aquaculture and marine matters, comes before the House today.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I also reflected on useful progress which has been made over the past few months working with General de Chastelain and progressing the resolution of the decommissioning issue through the decommissioning body chaired by him, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. We also reviewed the Drumcree issue.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday I met with the First Minister designate, David Trimble, at Government Buildings. We had a very useful meeting at which we settled a number of significant political aspects with regard to the supplementary international agreement to set up the North-South implementation bodies. Following further intensive work up to Sunday, full agreement was reached and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland signed the requisite four treaties in Dublin yesterday. These treaties provide for the North-South implementation bodies, the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>This latest achievement marks another significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. I pay tribute to all involved in this. The work will, of course, continue and with the commitment of all concerned I hope we will be in a position to report further progress soon. I had a further conversation with the British Prime Minister yesterday as well as a substantive, useful meeting with Mr. Gerry Adams. We will continue with our efforts in co-operation with the relevant parties until we succeed in securing a resolution to the current difficulties surrounding the formation of the Executive.</P>

      <P>That may have been possible. It was for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to decide and I understand she made her decision in consultation with the Prime Minister. It was realised that the deadline of tomorrow would not be reached and she therefore set what she believed to be a realistic date. I was not party to the decision but I have no great difficulty with it.</P>

      <P>What does the Taoiseach envisage is likely to happen during what may be called the American interlude as far as moving the process forward is concerned? Will any substantive discussion take place during the period when many of the participants are in the US? Do the Governments envisage making a joint proposal to the parties with a view to seeking to break the current deadlock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the period before the departure to the US and while most of the main players are abroad will be used to continue close dialogue. The format has not been worked out but I hope people will continue to engage directly. The more discussion and understanding between the parties the better. A host of agenda items relating to areas of partnership, including North-South bodies, the implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, have been under consideration over recent months. These continued to deflect away from direct engagement when the parties met. I am not sure if this was always justified and I expressed my impatience on a number of occasions. However, we have now moved beyond that phase and none of these items is now on the agenda. I am grateful to those involved and to the parties in Opposition. I especially thank the officials from a number of Departments and the parliamentary draftsmen who worked horrendous hours on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People need to discuss the current situation and what is there to be achieved and lost and to reflect on the few issues which will move us on. The parties have asked me on a number of occasions if the British and Irish Governments can achieve constructive movement on other issues without another impasse. They do not want one step taken, such as movement on the Executive, only to find there are no North-South bodies, or movement on North-South bodies but no British-Irish Council. The benefit of what we are debating later today is that if the impasse is overcome, we can move straight to the Executive, the North/South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. There is no obstacle to moving on any of these issues. Parties must reflect on that and realise the <Col N="1222" /> prize is a working assembly and Executive and other institutions.</P>
    <P>I hope people get the opportunity, whether privately or collectively, during St. Patrick's week to reflect on this issue. We and the American Administration are prepared to do anything we can to encourage that. This issue has been fairly clear to me for a long time and now the agenda is clear. I hope people will see what is to be gained.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach answered 14 questions together but he inadvertently omitted to answer Question No. 8 about <i>The Sunday Times</i> interview. I want to ask him a question about his meeting yesterday with Mr. Adams because the subject matter is the same. Did the Taoiseach confirm yesterday with Mr. Adams the view he was quoted as having expressed in <i>The Sunday Times</i> that it would be impossible for any elected Executive to take office and to form a Government if a party to that Executive or that Cabinet office had links with paramilitaries? If he confirmed the substance of the story in <i>The Sunday Times</i> to Mr. Adams during his meeting yesterday, what was Mr. Adams's response to that view, if the Taoiseach still holds that view?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that I dealt comprehensively with the interview in <i>The Sunday Times</i> two weeks ago in this House. It was not directly related to parliamentary questions but it came up and we discussed it for a considerable length of time. I have no difficulty with the full text of that interview. However, the situation has moved on and I have spoken to Mr. Adams a number of times since then. We discussed the impasse and the number of means by which we can attempt to move it on. Everybody else, including Mr. Adams, is engaged in trying to find a resolution of this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that everybody is trying to move on the issue, but did the Taoiseach express his view, as publicly quoted, that it is inconceivable that an executive could be formed in which one of the parties represented in that <Col N="1223" /> executive would continue to have links to a paramilitary organisation which had refused to decommission? If the Taoiseach conveyed such a view, if he still holds that view, what was the response yesterday, in his most recent contact with Mr. Adams, to that point of view?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My point of view yesterday, and for months, has not changed. This was a private meeting but the clear response from Sinn Féin is that it is doing all it can, under the terms of the Agreement, to find a resolution of this matter with General John de Chastelain. It is putting considerable effort into finding a way to deal with this item. That has not yet given us a way of getting around the impasse but the intensive discussions are ongoing. More effort has been put into this item than any other but we still have not found a resolution.</P>

      <P>I believe the Good Friday Agreement, which states that the decommissioning of arms is a central part of the Agreement, must stand. Mr. Adams, or other loyalist political groupings which have close associations with paramilitary groups, must accept that.

      <P>It is easy to talk up a crisis. Contacts between the parties and the two Governments are continuing, and that should be welcomed and encouraged. All of the issues Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned are being worked on in one form or another. The Patten Commission did excellent work over the winter and I believe it is on target to produce its report in the summer. The human rights commissioner was appointed last week and the equality agenda is moving on. We have had a fair amount of demilitarisation with a decrease in the number of troops and bases. We must continue to ensure that all these elements work together over time. Decommissioning, which is part of demilitarisation, is another element. During meetings I do not put more emphasis on one of these issues than on another. I try to move them all together and that is what I will continue to do.</P>
      <P>If progress is made on what was created in the past there will be a great deal of activity. Within a number of weeks there could be meetings of the Executive and the Assembly could be functioning properly. The North/South Ministerial Council could be working on the everyday issues that affect the lives of Nationalists, republicans, Unionists and loyalists. The British-Irish Council, in which Members of this House and the other parliaments will work together, could be operating, as could the intergovernmental conference.

He said with regard to the decision by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mowlam, to postpone the 10 March deadline to a later date that he had not been consulted or, to use his precise words, he had not been party to that decision. Am I to take it that the Taoiseach was not consulted and was not aware in advance or was there some communication between both Governments before this decision was taken by the British Government? The Taoiseach's earlier reply appears to imply that this was a unilateral decision by the British Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that one of the reasons there is a reluctance in the republican community to move forward with decommissioning is concern about matters in the 1970s when neighbourhoods were attacked by mobs and so forth? Will he also accept that reassurance must be given as to the adequacy of protection, given some of the threatening noises made in loyalist quarters? Will he equally agree that it falls to the republican community leadership to show leadership and not to put up murals that blame the other side all the time or that promote a one dimensional victim culture when the truth of the matter is that everyone is a victor in the peace process? Ultimately, there will be no victims if the peace process is a success. In loyalist and republican heartlands it is important that the culture of victimhood should be replaced by a culture of self-confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton. I am sure he would agree that it will take a long time for people to think that way. Last week I had the opportunity to meet groups from loyalist and republican strongholds. They feel strongly about these issues. One issue taxing their minds is the increase in what we would call ordinary crime. That affects them and leads to the issue of RUC reform and how that will be linked in. The Patten Commission is very conscious of this. These groups have fears about these issues. As much as we would all disagree with the structures that have been in place there for the past number of years, those are the issues that are taxing their minds. We must build confidence to enable people think differently from the way they thought in past decades, but it will take time to do that. We must move forward to a situation where people do not look to others to sort out policing problems. That is still a problem area in the North, for which I do not have a ready solution. It is highlighted by representative groups who are concerned about these matters. I refer to groups who are representative of human rights, justice, truth and other groups who do not support violence. This is a problem area we must try to resolve.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to supplementary questions from Deputy Quinn on 9 February last, the Office of the Attorney General will be considering the publication of pre-1922 legislation on CD-ROM over the coming months. Whether relevant pre-1922 statutes should be published alone or as part of a fully revised Statute Book is one of the issues to be considered. The recent appointment of the director of the statute law revision and consolidation unit in the Office of the Attorney General will assist this process.</P>

This is the first step in the process to produce a revised Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I had a very useful meeting with Archbishop Rodriguez of Honduras on 22 February last. We discussed the recent tragic events in his own country and he was very thankful for the work done by Irish agencies and aid workers in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. We spent most of our time discussing Third World debt and how it should be handled.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to him that Ireland fully supports international efforts to achieve the greatest possible level of debt relief for those countries who are prepared to engage in sustainable economic and social programmes. In this context, I undertook to urge my European colleagues to support the archbishop's request for favourable consideration of the alleviation of debt and interest payments for the poorest countries. The archbishop for his part said he would encourage indebted countries to increase their commitment to democratic and social processes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been making this argument for some years, and I have made it at World Bank and IMF meetings. We are not in favour of outright debt collection, because a number of dictatorships would benefit. We have stated for a number of years that we will continue to press the international community, the IMF and the World Bank to give the highest possible debt relief to countries prepared to engage in appropriate economic and social reforms. These reforms have to be clear and substantial. Some countries have done this, but many are not prepared to act on what has been dictated by the IMF and the World Bank. That is the only benchmark one can have; either they are prepared to engage in these appropriate economic and social reforms or they cannot expect to make progress.</P>
      <P>Archbishop Rodriguez feels strongly that there must be an understanding on these issues. He makes coherent arguments for Honduras, but also represents the Vatican and the Pope on these matters. It is not simple, but a benchmark must be set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that more than a commitment to the principle of debt reduction is required, welcome though that is? Following the end of the Cold War, there is an absolute necessity for the World Bank and the IMF to ensure structural adjustment in financial terms also means an adjustment in the structure of civic society, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, so as to ensure a market economy can function effectively and efficiently.</P>

      <P>The information I referred to in Question No. 310 of 2 March 1999 includes the statistical data on Irish language usage available from the last census; the information that my Department has acquired from the operation of scéim labhairt na Gaeilge; the information and knowledge that the officers of my Department based in the Gaeltacht have on the subject; and the information acquired by Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Áras Uí Chadhain, Coláiste na Gaillimhe, and other relevant bodies.</P>

      <P>This is fairly scant information from a Government source. An independent study is now called for to evaluate matters in the Gaeltacht and how the revival is being effected.

      <P>As I have said in a previous answer to a similar question, we now need action. We have very accurate information, and from my experience in looking at the breakdown of this information by district electoral division, the information in both the scéim labhairt na Gaeilge results and the census mirror what I would have perceived as the situation on the ground, given a detailed knowledge of the situation on a townland by townland basis. We already know the difficulties or otherwise of the language in the Gaeltacht. We also have a good idea of the various pressures being put on the language. We need to address those issues in a positive way, and I have taken steps to initiate that work rather than perennially coming back with information already available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the information in his reply is effectively in-house information, and that the study that was in the process of being commissioned for his Department was to look at his Department's schemes and what Údarás na Gaeltachta was doing? While I am not inferring that somebody would be less than objective, there is a need for an overall view of this matter. The Minister of State spoke about action; will he indicate what action we can expect in the next month, the next <Col N="1232" /><Col N="1233" /> six months, the next year and the lifetime of this Government? It seems we are hearing about action, but we are not seeing any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this information, the first part is totally independent. The Central Statistics Office's obligation is to provide accurate data for the State. I hope the Deputy is not impugning its independence and objectivity. In relation to the information on scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, the Deputy will probably be aware that that scheme is administered by Department officials talking to children. Those officials are highly competent, and the results of the scéim labhairt na Gaeilge mirror what the census has told us. It also mirrors what those of us who live in and are familiar with the Gaeltacht know to be the facts from experience.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt what the situation is. The terms of the proposed study, were too restrictive. It proposed looking at the effects of my Department's schemes on Irish in the Gaeltacht. However, their effect is totally positive, because my Department operates through Irish. We also know that a large number of Government agencies in the Gaeltacht operate through English, and it would be more to the point to examine the effect they are having on the Gaeltacht rather than examining the effect of my Department's schemes, which is a positive one. It is obvious to those of us in the Gaeltacht that people there ritually deal with my Department in Irish, while they deal with other State agencies through English, as they feel the other agencies do not have a competence to deal with them in Irish. Whether that is true, it is the perception. Pressure is not coming on Irish from my Department's schemes, and examining those schemes is of relative little merit.</P>
      <P>In language planning, we must look at the total effect of all influences on the Gaeltacht. We are already at the negotiation stage in the development of language plans for the Gaeltacht. It is unfortunate that this did not happen years ago or during the life of the previous Government, but we are now actively involved in this work. We are drawing up plans and are in negotiation. I hope to make an announcement on this matter in the relatively near future, though I do not know if that will be in one month or six weeks. We are talking about a timeframe to get pilot schemes going. I want to deal with the basic information we have and to deal with the issues recognised as being involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State telling me there is no validity in an in-depth, independent and external study of the Gaeltacht and how the various schemes in the Gaeltacht are impacting on Irish as a means of communication there? In terms of action, is he saying that some form of ill-defined action will be taken at some undefined future time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that defined action <Col N="1234" /> will be taken at a defined time in the future. At that time the Deputy will be aware of the details of the action. I am not in a position today to give details of those programmes as they are still being worked out.</P>
      <P>The previous study would have been very expensive; that money would have been better used in doing something about Irish in the Gaeltacht. The terms of reference referred specifically to the schemes operated by my Department, which operates in a proactive way in the Gaeltacht. Neither my Department nor its activities are damaging the language in the Gaeltacht. However, a wide range of forces, including the media, State and private services, are impacting severely on the language in the Gaeltacht. Given that we have to live in the real world, we will concentrate on those issues. I do not see any advantage in attacking or studying in depth the schemes specifically run in the Irish language for the good of the language. That is a most peculiar way of tackling the problem.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in replies to previous questions on this matter, a Bill is being drafted that will provide for a statutory regime to facilitate the early introduction in Ireland of digital broadcasting services, in particular digital terrestrial television. The draft text of the Bill is at a very advanced stage of preparation. I had hoped to be in a position to have the text of the Bill published before the end of March. However the matters to be addressed in the legislation are complex and, accordingly, finalising the details of the draft Bill with the Attorney General's office is a difficult and time consuming process. At this stage I believe that an April publication date is more likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inter-departmental project management group, chaired by my Department, was established to oversee the selection of a partner for RTE to form the commercial entity which will be responsible for the provision of terrestrial transmission and technical facilities to existing broadcasters and to broadcasters in the new digital era. I recently announced that a consortium headed by AIB Corporate Finance has been selected by public competition to act as advisers to my Department on the establishment of the entity. The consultants have already begun their task. I understand RTE is proceeding with the identification of the assets and other contractual relationships it considers would be appropriate to transfer to the new entity. I hope the new entity will be established and that negotiations with a <Col N="1235" /> suitable prospective partner or partners will be concluded within a six to eight month period.</P>

      <P>It is not customary to deal with the contents of a Bill until it is published. The outline of the Bill has been discussed on numerous occasions and I do not propose to go into detail now. Suffice to say that in a complex Bill legal issues have to be addressed carefully. It is important when legislation comes before the House that it is as accurate as possible. That saves the time of the House by not requiring the tabling of further amendments on issues that could be cleared initially, particularly those of a legal content. Although there is a slight slippage in the time envisaged for publication of the Bill, it is only a matter of a few weeks.</P>

I apologise to the Deputy for neglecting to reply to the second part of his question concerning digitalisation and its impact on the whole island. Negotiations have been taking place with UTV for some time on the question of transmission. When Dr. Mo Mowlam visited my Department some months ago I had the opportunity to press that issue forward in respect of analog and digital. I have no doubt there will be further opportunities for co-ordination and co-operation.</P>

Bhí clár ar Raidio na Gaeltachta ar maidin, áfach, agus de réir an chláir sin tá laghdú ar mhéid na nAifrinntí atá á léamh tré mheán na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ar an deireadh seachtaine. Thug an clár sin le fios go raibh thart ar 50 faoin gcéad de na hAifrinntí i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall i mBéarla.</P>
      <P>Cén fáth nár thug an tAire Stáit an Bille Cearta a foilsíodh in Albain agus sa Bhreatain Bheag isteach anseo chun a gceartanna a thabhairt do na Gaeilgeoirí a bhfuil comhnaí orthu sna Gaeltachtaí?</P>

      <P>Tá Bille Teanga sa Bhreatain Bheag agus mar is eol don Teachta tá staidéar á dhéanamh agamsa ar Bhille Teanga agus go leor oibre déanta len é a réiteach agus tiocfaidh sé faoi bhráid na Dála gan mhoill.</P>
      <P>Níl Bille Teangan acu in Alban go bhfios domsa, ach is féidir mé a cheartú ar sin. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an Teachta ag tagairt don Chairt Eorpach do na Mionteangacha. Más é sin é, ní bheadh na forálacha atá i gceist sa Chairt Eorpach chomh láidir leis na forálacha atá i gceist agamsa don mBille Teangan agus mar sin beidh cosaint i bhfad níos láidre sa mBille Teangan atá á thabhairt isteach agam ná mar a thabharfaí faoin gCairt Eorpach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> An fáth nár thug mé isteach é ná go bhfuil éiginnteacht ann maidir leis an tionchar a bheadh ag an gCairt Eorpach sin ar sheasamh bunreachtúil na Gaeilge agus nílimse sásta tada a dhéanamh a chuirfeadh an seasamh sin in aon amhras nó in aon chontúirt. Nílim sásta rud ar bith a thabhairt isteach nach bhfuil ag réiteach go hiomlán le stádas na Gaeilge mar an phríomhtheanga agus an chéad teanga oifigiúil sa tír.</P>
    <P>Gach rud atá sa Chairt, agus i bhfad Éireann lena chois, beidh siad sa mBille Teangan nuair a thiocfaidh sé amach agus cuideoidh sé go mór le stádas ceart a thabhairt don Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na nGaeltacht, tá údar imní ann ach caithfimid a bheith réalaíoch. Má bhreathnaítear ar na figiúirí siar go dtí an t-ochtú céad déag bhí meath ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht i gcónaí  &ndash; bhí tuairiscí ann a dúirt ag tús na gcaogaidí nach raibh ach 35,000 cainteoir dúchais sa tír. Tá a fhios againn anois ag deireadh na haoise seo go bhfuil os cionn 100,000 ag labhairt na Gaeilge chuile lá, tar éis na gasúir scoile a bhaint as  &ndash; táim ag déanamh coigeartú ar na figiúirí chun figiúirí cruinn a fháil.</P>
    <P>Deir thart ar 3 faoin gcéad den phobal de chuile aois ghrúpa go labhrann siad Gaeilge go laethúil. Tá fadhbanna ann ach níor mhaith liom go dtabharfadh duine ar bith breith an bháis don Ghaeilge. Tuigim go bhfuil fadhbanna ann sna Gaeltachtaí ach tá fás ag teacht ar an nGaeilge ar bhealaí eile. Tá seans againn dul ar aghaidh agus í a fhorbairt agus a láidriú laistigh de na Gaeltachtaí agus taobh amuigh de ach pleananna cuimsitheacha a bheith againn chuige. Cuid lárnach de sin is ea an Bille Teangan.</P>

      <P>Tá staidéar cuimsitheach déanta ag an Roinn ní amháin ar an mBille Cearta Teanga sin ach ar Bhillí Teangan i dtíortha eile. Is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil rudaí éagsúla bainte as chuile ceann acu. De bharr saíocht speisialta na tíre seo níl aon cheann acu a oireann go hiomlán agus ní fhéadfaí ceann na Breataine Bige a aistriú isteach i ndlí na hÉireann mar ní mar a chéile an dá chás. Bheadh súil againn go mbeidh an Bille a thabharfaidh muide isteach i bhfad níos feiliúnaí do staid na Gaeilge ná mar a bheadh sé dá dtógfaí bille ó thír eile ar mhaithe le héascaíocht ach gan é a bheith feiliúnach ar chor ar bith do stádas bunreachtúil nó stádas dlithiúil na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin ní mór dúinn bille nua a scríobh ach ní miste dúinn breathnú ar an eolas idirnáisiúnta ar fad atá ar fáil agus chuige sin thug mo Roinn cúnamh nach beag do Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge anuraidh ag cur comhdháil náisiúnta maidir <Col N="1238" /> le reachtaíocht teangan ar bun agus as a bhfuair muid an-chuid eolais, Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an gComhdháil as ucht na léachtaí go léir a tugadh ag an gcomhdháil sin a fhoilsiú le gairid  &ndash; beidh siad mar lámhleabhar an-úsáideach dúinn.

Ní dhéanfadh sé sin aon rud do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Cén fáth nach dtabharfadh sé bille simplí isteach  &ndash; tá staidéar déanta ar an gceist leis na cianta ach tá líon na ndaoine atá ag labhairt Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí ag titim gach lá.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The records in question are the property of the Land Commission records branch which operates as part of the Land Commission and they have not yet been legally transferred to the National Archives.</P>
      <P>While the records are being stored in the National Archives premises in Bishop Street, Dublin, the National Archives has no statutory responsibility for access to, or the management of, these records.</P>
      <P>The principal reason the arrangements for the legal transfer of these records were not proceeded with to date is that the National Archives did not have sufficient facilities or space to allow the very large quantity of records involved to be stored and accessed properly and in suitable conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am pleased that when the adap<Col N="1239" /> tation and extension of the warehouse to the rear of the National Archives building in Bishop Street has been completed, there should be sufficient suitable storage space available. It is likely that the director of the National Archives will then recommend that the arrangements for the transfer have become adequate and that the legal transfer should proceed. The Deputy will recall that I announced the pre-planning stage of this major project for the National Archives building at the end of 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter because in the west of Ireland stories are legion concerning the late Micheál Ó Moráin having divided estates with a poker in the ashes of country houses. Perhaps, even the late Éamon de Valera did the same thing. With the Freedom of Information Act the descendants of those who either got land or did not, are in some cases, anxious to know what was recorded for or against them, as the case may be. I know it is an emotional issue.</P>
      <P>Is the Land Commission making arrangements so that the legal transfer of these documents could be made simultaneously with the availability of facilities in the National Archives, when that situation is sorted out and sufficient storage space is available? Once the records become the property of the National Archives, will they be available to the general public or to specific personnel operating on request only? Will they be available in the normal way, as applies to planning files, where one can look at a file and take notes of it without taking copies? When does the Minister envisage that might take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from an historical point of view the interest there would be in such records. I have outlined to the Deputy the reason the arrangements have not yet been made. The principal reason is that the arrangements for transfer were considered inadequate in 1992. Once there are proper storage and access facilities this information will be made available. Work is progressing on the capital project for the storage of archival records to be located in a redeveloped warehouse building to the rear of the existing premises. It is hoped that physical work on the development may commence by the end of the year 2000. That will give the Deputy some idea of when the buildings will be available for this kind of information.</P>
      <P>He is perfectly right in saying a legal hand over must take place. However, I understand from the Land Commission that a legislative order for the dissolution of the Land Commission is being considered at present. A number of things are happening in tandem and when all these matters are drawn together I see no reason there should be any undue delay. It is important that this kind of information should be made available. No doubt, it will be made available in the usual way, as other parts of the archives are.</P>

      <P>If it is clearly the intent to have these records transferred to the National Archives, will the Minister confirm if preparatory work is now going on to have them legally transferred from the Land Commission to the National Archives, simultaneous to the facilities becoming available? Will she outline the function of the Land Commission staff? Is there a curator in charge of the land commission files, are they in good condition or are they likely to have disintegrated beyond legibility before being transferred to the National Archives? </P>

      <P>I will put the Deputy's mind at rest. The records are being stored in the National Archives premises in Bishop Street. They cannot be accessed due to lack of space. Once we have the space, and I hope to have it by 2000, the information will be made available.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the records disintegrating before our eyes. The files are being stored in suitable conditions which unfortunately do not allow the general access that is advisable. The legal position also has to be addressed.</P>

      <P>My time frame for the Irish film industry extends beyond one year, as does the planning time frame for the industry itself. I am working to put in place a strategic plan that will bring the industry into the new millennium. To this end, in accordance with the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, I established in mid-1998 the strategic review group for the Irish film industry with representation from a broad spectrum of the industry with the objective of preparing for my consideration recommendations for a strategic plan for the industry for the first decade of the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in accordance with the programme for Government, I have established the Screen Commission of Ireland on an operational basis. I have already informed the House that I recently travelled to the United States to launch in Los Angeles the Screen Commission of Ireland. I also used the opportunity to make and renew contacts with key people in the Hollywood studios whose investment decisions also span a time frame greater than one year. On all of these occasions, I took the opportunity to signal to the American audiovisual sector the Government's strong commitment to the continued development of the Irish film industry as <Col N="1241" /> a vital element of Ireland's cultural and industrial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The one year extension of section 481 is giving rise to concern in the industry. Does the Minister believe the present uncertainty is conducive to confidence in the industry when it is borne in mind that it probably takes three years from start to finish to procure the money for a production? Will she state categorically that the present situation is conducive to protecting the existing 4,000 jobs and building on that base in an industry with great growth potential? Has she taken into consideration that a similar provision to section 481 is now available in Wales and Scotland which puts our film industry at a competitive disadvantage? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it no secret that section 35, now known as section 481, has been a tremendous boon to the industry and has given it great strength and direction. I am well aware that other countries are trying to put a structure in place to encourage film production in their countries not least, Scotland and Wales. I wish them luck. However it is most important that we do not sit back and think the provisions of section 481 are sufficient. We need a strategic plan. I established the strategic review group for the film industry to look at the plans for the next ten years and that is why it is imperative to have people who are involved in the industry on a day to day basis to be part of the strategic group. Recommendations based on their views will be drawn up as a result of in-depth discussions.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting the report from the strategic review group which I understand will be with me in a number of weeks. I look forward to seeing their recommendations. Once the information comes to hand I will publish the INDECON report as an appendix to the report of the strategic review group.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out &ndash; and I took the opportunity to do so on a number of occasions in the United States &ndash; that we should await the recommendations of the strategic review group before taking action to bolster the Irish film industry. One should view the continuation of section 481 for a further year in that context because I hope we will have a number of recommendations that will further strengthen the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about the importance of a strategic long-term plan, however, my basic concern is that we may be losing the momentum that led to our stunning success specifically because the provisions of section 481 will apply only for a further year. I am concerned that the industry does not lose the momentum. I accept we need to move forward on a strategic basis but if confidence is lost in Ireland as a centre for film making the strategic plan will be working from a base that has been considerably weakened.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that figures for the take up of section 481 in 1998 are just as healthy as they were in 1997. The figures in recent years have been steady. I share the Deputy's concern about weakening the industry but the figures do not substantiate that argument. The strategic review group will make its recommendations in coming weeks and I hope to start working on that as soon as I get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister been in contact with the film makers of Ireland recently on their consultants report called The Bigger Picture which made a number of recommendations on section 481 provisions? Will she clarify what she meant when she referred to &ldquo;questions about the future of section 481&rdquo; during her speech in Los Angeles. The Minister said it would be a central part of the Irish industry for the next ten years. Does that mean if the strategic review group recommend the extension of section 481 for a period of years she will support it? Has she examined the implications of taxation policy in the current structure of section 481? It is of value to taxpayers at the higher rate as the write off is up to 80 per cent, but with the lowering of the higher rate of tax, its value is being reduced. How does the Minister propose to deal with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested at all times in the views expressed by the film makers of Ireland particularly at a time when a great deal of work is being done to strengthen the industry and in putting forward its recommendations. I am rather amused that the Deputy has been trying to put words in my mouth in regard to what I am purported to have said in Los Angeles. I have always recognised the strength of section 481, which will continue for the next year. We await the film industry's recommendations and it is important not to rule out improvements to the provision. We should not let things stay as they are simply because they have worked so far. Given the competition from many other countries and the industry's potential, we should be among the leaders in encouraging further investment from outside and within Ireland to build our indigenous film industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To enlighten the Deputy, I referred to a decade in the context of the strategic review group which was set up to look at the film industry over that period, because we do not want a short-term view. I am interested in receiving the recommendations of those directly involved in the industry. If I had wanted to I could have decided what I thought it required, which might have been much quicker but I doubt it would have been better. I wanted those involved on a day to day basis to be able to make their recommendations directly to me. I asked them specifically to consider section 481. That was their first task which I wanted done as quickly as possible. I also asked them to look at every aspect of the industry over the next ten years, including education and training.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, when the Department commenced certifying full projects as qualifying to raise investment under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, the following number of projects have been certified. In 1994, 11 projects were certified with an Irish spend of £44.8 million; in 1995, 48 projects were certified with an Irish spend of £73.9 million; in 1196, 31 projects were certified with an Irish spend of £53.2 million; in 1997, 32 projects were certified with an Irish spend of £78.7 million; in 1998, 32 projects were certified with an Irish spend of £81.9 million; and in 1999 to date, four projects have been certified with an Irish spend of £6.9 million. Although the film industry fluctuates from year to year, those figures show there has been a consistent use of section 481. I hope in future we will not have to rely on one item of the tax code to build our film industry. We want further initiatives and to be able to implement them as best and as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say whether guidelines were in place for the current operational year as opposed to a three year period. The longer period allowed great flexibility but it is doubtful whether the same could be said of a year. We could do other things. For instance, Wexford County Council has a screen commission &ndash; when will the Minister encourage all local authorities to set up such a body? Will the Minister be in touch with Clare County Council to set up a commission? The county has many areas of scenic beauty, such as Mullaghmore, which would do justice to Ireland if they were shown abroad. The Department should be pro-active in this area. Why did it not ask other counties to follow the lead of Wexford County Council and set up a screen commission?</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that he had the privilege of being Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, as it then was and, if he had been interested, could have initiated such proposals for County Clare, but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy O'Shea, it was said earlier on Question Time that it is easy to talk up a crisis or create uncertainty, and I hope that is not the basis for his question. There need be no uncertainty for the film industry about how we wish to progress. The precise timetable for the submission to me of the report of the strategic review group is out of my control. I will receive it when it is finalised. I am given to understand its completion is imminent and I will have it in a number of weeks. I can assure the Deputy that when I have it I will see how we can implement its recommendations.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for acknowledging that we set up the screen commission, which was the purpose of my visit to Los Angeles. It will be of great help to the film industry and will give it further direction and focus. People in the industry have wanted such a commission for many years and I am pleased I was able to bring it to fruition.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right that some counties have been to the fore in establishing their own screen commissions. Deputy Deenihan has kindly invited me to attend the launch of the Screen Commission in County Kerry. When I visited the locations exhibition in LA, I was pleased to see, on display at the Screen Commission's desk, information about the Screen Commission of County Kerry. I have always been interested in furthering the cause of regionalisation and I would encourage the establishment of further screen commissions, not least in County Clare.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 3 February last to Question No. 55 regarding the latest position in respect of the provision of a national centre for the performing arts, including a conservatoire in Dublin. The House will be aware that last year the Minister for Education and Science and I jointly established an interdepartmental working group to examine and report back on the feasibility of establishing an academy for the performing arts, including a conservatoire at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin. The working group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Noel Lindsay, issued an interim report at the end of July last. This report concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Earlsfort Terrace site is suitable for the purpose envisaged and could be adapted for such use. The group supported the idea of locating the academy there but stressed that certain critical issues have to be resolved before this can happen. How best to resolve these issues is still under active consideration.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the issues involved are complex and multi-faceted and that their resolution will impinge on many State agencies and educational institutions. It would be inappropriate for me at this time to go into the detail of the issues to be resolved but I assure the Deputy that work is ongoing in the matter and that my colleague the Minister for Education and Science and I remain fully committed to the objective of achieving the establishment of a centre for the performing arts, including a conservatoire, so as to provide training opportunities for Irish students to develop their talents to the highest international standards.</P>

      <P>Without being specific, will the Minister provide an outline of the difficulties involved? The Minister's reply was vague and contained evasive jargon. However, I am not accusing her of bad faith. Is the Minister in a position to provide a broad outline of the difficulties involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to believe that I am using jargon in order to cover for inaction on my Department's part. The issue of establishing a conservatoire is dear to my heart and tremendous commitment and support has been given by the Minister for Education and Science and the Taoiseach to achieving that goal. We want this project to commence in the year 2000; it is not a pie in the sky idea, but one which will come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science and the working group have been in contact with a number of interested parties. Not least among these is UCD in view of the fact that the possibility of using Earlsfort Terrace is under dis<Col N="1246" /> cussion. The Deputy may be aware that newspaper reports noted the interest of DCU in the project and that that institution, and others invited to do so by the public notice issued by the working group, made vigorous representations in respect of the academy many months ago. Many options have been put forward.</P>
    <P>As stated previously, I would like the conservatoire to be established at Earlsfort Terrace but many issues must be considered before a final decision is made. If DCU or any other institution fulfils the criteria laid down, their proposals would be worthy of consideration. However, the Minister for Education and Science and I are continuing discussions with UCD and others. I reiterate that the Government views this matter in a serious light and we want the project to commence in the year 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The introduction of this legislation in Dáil Éireann and similar enabling legislation in Westminster represents a further major milestone in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is another historic step in the development of relations on this island and between the islands of Ireland and Britain following the signature yesterday of the four treaties which are among the five treaties, including the Good Friday Agreement, for which motions have just been moved. The legislation makes provisions for a key institutional aspect of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key points in the Bill are as follows: Part 1 provides for the participation of the Taoiseach and Ministers in the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council and for general provisions, including a power for the Taoiseach to make regulations to remove difficulties <Col N="1250" /> in the way of bringing the Bill or the Agreement into operation.</P>
    <P>Parts 2 to 7 and the associated parts of annexes 1 and 2 to the international agreement scheduled to the Bill provide for the functions, manner of exercise of the functions, structure and powers of each of the implementation bodies.</P>
    <P>These parts give the force of domestic law to the majority of the provisions of the Agreement, including, in particular, annexes 1 and 2.</P>
    <P>Concerning structure, four of the six implementation bodies &ndash; food safety, trade and business development, language, and aquaculture and marine will have boards. In the case of the Food Safety Promotion Board, it was agreed that the board would be of an advisory character. The special EU programmes body and the Waterways Ireland body will be in the nature of executive agencies headed by chief executives reporting to the relevant formations of the North-South Ministerial Council. All the bodies will have chief executives. This represents a satisfactory outcome. To ensure the bodies get off to a good start, provision has been made for interim CE0s to be in place from day one pending the appointment of the definitive CE0s by open recruitment in most cases. The necessary funding and staffing for the bodies has been pre-agreed by the two sovereign Governments for year one, at satisfactory levels, with corresponding indicative figures for years two and three, when the bodies would be expected to be operating at their full initial levels.</P>
    <P>Key points to note in relation to individual bodies are, in the case of Waterways Ireland, that in addition to immediate transfer of the Shannon-Erne waterway, all the island's currently navigable waterways will be transferred to the body from 1 April 2000 when a three region structure &ndash; eastern, western and northern &ndash; will come into effect. The body is empowered to engage in promotion, including marketing and development, of the tourism and commercial potential of the inland waterways for which it has responsibility. This body thus has the opportunity and the capacity to make a major contribution to the development of parts of the island that have yet to reap the fullest benefit from tourism.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board will have responsibility in an area of key concern to the general public, as indicated by recent debates and controversies. The body will have an all island remit in relation to the promotion of food safety and will work in association with the existing food safety agencies, North and South, which will continue to be responsible for inspection and enforcement. The Bill amends the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, with a view to a rational and effective division of labour with our authority in the State and a clear operational remit for the implementation body. As provided in the supplementary Agreement on the bodies, it is intended that the body will, in an independent manner, through independent scientific advice, promote the safety and hygiene of food pro<Col N="1251" /> duced, distributed or marketed on the island of Ireland. To that end, the North-South Ministerial Council will appoint, in addition to the advisory board, an advisory committee, including scientific experts and representatives of broader food safety interests.</P>
    <P>The trade and business development body will exercise a significant range of functions, including responsibility, from the outset for a number of specific operational schemes, such as administering a programme to enable companies to undertake joint product and process development projects of commercial benefit; implementing a science and technology awareness programme on a North-South basis; and an innovation award scheme on the same basis. The body will be tasked to bring forward to the North-South Ministerial Council within three months proposals on the development of a North-South equity investment fund programme for consideration and decision by the Council. Again, this represents a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>The special EU programmes body will have significant functions in relation to post-1999 Structural Funds, including advising the North-South Ministerial Council and the Finance Departments on the negotiation of the post-1999 Community initiatives and the common chapter on co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It will prepare, for the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council and in close consultation with the Finance Departments and other relevant Departments, detailed programme proposals under the new Community initiatives. It will also undertake grant-making and other managerial functions in respect of INTERREG 3 and North-South elements of programmes under other initiatives. The proposals are to include recommendations on: the structure of measures for inclusion; the allocations to measures; and the objectives of each measure. The body's importance will be significantly enhanced if, as now seems likely, the recent visits by Messrs. Trimble and Mallon to Brussels and Bonn and the supportive activities of the two Governments bear fruit in terms of major special programmes funding for Northern Ireland and the Border counties in the post-1999 period.</P>
    <P>The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will be able to tap the significant potential for the development of aquaculture and marine tourism in the areas concerned with obvious benefit to the economies of counties Donegal and Louth, following the extension of the functions of the Foyle Fisheries Commission to include Carlingford Lough and its basin and the extension of functions to cover the development of angling and marine tourism. Complex legislation is required to provide for the agreed function of the development and licensing of aquaculture. It has been agreed that this legislation will be brought forward in both jurisdictions before the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Draft legislation on this matter had been well <Col N="1252" /> advanced in this jurisdiction, in the context of the existing Foyle Fisheries Commission, and it should be possible to move this forward expeditiously, although the Northern side is less advanced.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights is a reserved matter for which the Whitehall Department of Environment, Transport and Regions has responsibility. However, the Agreement provides that British and Irish legislation will be brought forward to make the body the general lighthouse authority for the island of Ireland. This legislation will be brought forward, if possible, before the entry into force of the Agreement on the bodies but as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the North-South Language Body, a point of note is that it will take the form of a single body with two separate parts, one concerned with the Irish language and the other with Ullans and Ulster Scots cultural issues. With the input of funding and enthusiasm from the Northern side, the body, which will have more than double the staff of Bord na Gaeilge, should give a significant impetus to Irish language promotion on the island. The two agencies within the body will operate almost completely independently of each other, thus ensuring that the Irish language agency will be able to operate in Irish, which is stated in the Agreement to be its working language. Given that the part of the Bill dealing with the language body will replace the Bord na Gaeilge Act, 1978, it is set out primarily in Irish in the Bill, with an English translation attached to facilitate British and Northern Ireland readers. A courtesy translation into Irish of the relevant part of the Agreement is being supplied to Deputies and Senators with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VIII makes provision in respect of matters common to all bodies, including the transfer of staff to the bodies, grants to bodies, reports and accounts of bodies, the application of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, and the application of the Data Protection Act, 1988. The Bill provides for the application of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, to the implementation bodies and, in the interest of harmonisation, provides for any necessary liaison and consultation with the Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the Agreement to which the Bill gives effect, the bodies will be subject to the data protection legislation applicable in each jurisdiction. Provision is made in the Agreement for liaison and consultation between the relevant authorities, North and South &ndash; the Data Protection Commissioner and the UK Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <P>In the absence, at present, of a statutory FOI regime in the UK, and given the substantial differences between the two jurisdictions in terms of access to information, the Agreement provides that the Ministers responsible for freedom of information will as soon as practicable draw up a code of practice on access to information for approval by the North-South Ministerial Council. Similarly, and for much the same reasons, the <Col N="1253" /> Agreement provides that each body will draw up a code of conduct for approval by the NSMC, covering its aims and values, its obligations to the public and the accountability and conduct of its members and staff. In addition, in order to avoid any problem that could arise from differences in the law of the two jurisdictions, including such as could arise from varying court interpretations of the law as it applies to the implementation bodies, arrangements have been agreed for consultations between the Attorneys General.</P>
    <P>In the course of the intensive and difficult negotiations which led to the preparation of this Bill and its British counterpart, the Irish side was concerned to ensure two things above all: first, that the substance of the package agreed on the 18 December should be fully maintained, and, second, that the legal mechanisms for establishing the bodies, together with the financial and organisational arrangements, should be such as to ensure that the bodies will be in a position to function fully and effectively from the entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that both of these conditions have been met. The overall package as reflected in the Agreement and the Bill represents a very satisfactory outcome. The fact that the provisions regarding the implementation bodies are set out in an international agreement to be given the force of law in the State and at Westminster ensures that there is the necessary legal assurance and certainty underpinning the operation of the bodies. The Government is satisfied that, taken together with the separate programme of co-operation through existing bodies and having regard to the possibilities for further development through the work of the North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies will have the potential to significantly enhance North-South interaction on this island.</P>
    <P>The separate programme of co-operation through existing bodies arises from the requirement in the Good Friday Agreement to identify, in addition to at least six implementation bodies, at least six matters where existing bodies would be the appropriate mechanism for co-operation in each separate jurisdiction. The 18 December statement recorded agreement that specified aspects of transport, agriculture, education, health, environment and tourism would be suitable for initial consideration by the NSMC in this regard, and that it would be open to the North-South Ministerial Council, by agreement between the two sides, to consider other matters. The relevant Departments have been asked to work out the details of this programme with their Northern counterparts and this is ongoing. I have already referred to this position with regard to tourism.</P>
    <P>In ballpark terms, the implementation bodies, once they are set up and running, will involve some £56 million in annual expenditure, with a total staff of about 880. The additional cost to the Exchequer for the bodies is still provisional, but is roughly estimated to be in the region of £5 to <Col N="1254" /> £10 million for this year, rising to an extra £25 million in round terms by 2001.</P>
    <P>Accountability arrangements for the North-South bodies are dealt with in Part VII, Annex 2 of the draft treaty. In particular, the financial accountability arrangements will mirror existing provisions covering bodies which come within the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General within this jurisdiction, with reciprocal arrangements for Northern Ireland. In relation to Dáil Éireann, this will require the bodies to be amenable to account for the expenditure of money provided by the Oireachtas and for other matters arising from value for money examinations.</P>
    <P>The text of the draft treaty specifies that the bodies will submit copies of their statements of account to the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland and the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General, who will in co-operation examine and certify the accounts. It also provides for access by the Comptroller and Auditor General to all necessary records of North-South bodies. Any report concerning the body by the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland will be laid before the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures that audit reports and other reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be presented to the body concerned and to the relevant Minister who will cause copies to be laid before Dáil Éireann. The Financial Memorandum to be prescribed for each body will specify an upward time limit for the completion of the process of three months after receiving the audited reports of the accounts.</P>
    <P>Members of the body or its staff will be required to appear before and otherwise co-operate with the Committee of Public Accounts. Other practical day-to-day management issues relating to the accounting and audit arrangements of the bodies, including value-for-money studies and inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General of other bodies receiving grants from the North-South bodies in both jurisdictions, will be incorporated in the Financial Memorandum.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the new North-South arrangements make good, practical sense for all of the people on this island. Up to now opportunities for co-operation were available mainly in a non-structured, <i>ad hoc</i> way and while many organisations, for example, CBI and IBEC, have long pioneered North-South economic co-operation, the new implementation bodies provide opportunities to bring the work for our mutual advantage to another plane. There is a crucial imperative to put both parts of this island in a position to compete and to succeed in an era of global markets and global competition. This requires serious co-operation in areas of the economy such as trade and business development and developing together our relationship with the European Union, through the EU programmes body.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border trade remains well below the lev<Col N="1255" /> els that are typical of neighbouring economies or regions. We in the South have reaped the success of an approach to our economy based on partnership and co-operation. We want to conduct our business in a spirit of partnership with a proper institutional framework that can support and break down the barriers to effective co-operation.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations leading up to the Good Friday Agreement, the Unionist and loyalist parties acknowledged that North-South bodies were needed, not only for the practical benefits they would bring but also because they represent a vital institutional expression of the Irish identity of northern nationalists and of their associated identification with Ireland as a whole and with this State. The Agreement which this Bill is implementing lays the foundations for a closer coming together of North and South. There are many ways in the years ahead that the choice of a united Ireland can be made more attractive to a majority of the people in the North. The responsibility is ours. As expressed in the Downing Street Declaration, Irish unity could be achieved only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and without coercion.</P>
    <P>In recent times the tendency has been to focus on the differences and the difficulties, but there is and has been a huge amount of agreement on the way forward and practical expression has been given to the areas of agreement. We must continue to strive for agreement on all aspects of the implementation of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. All parties must recognise the overwhelming consensus on the island for peace. For our part we will continue to work on fulfilling our obligations under the Agreement and we expect all of the parties to do the same.</P>
    <P>While the implementation of this part of the Agreement has primarily been a matter for the two Governments, it has, of course, involved close consultation with the Northern Ireland parties, in particular the UUP, the SDLP, and Sinn Féin. I wish to record my appreciation of their role in progressing this key part of the Agreement. The First Minister designate, David Trimble, has adopted a constructive approach throughout, on the basis that the implementation bodies will bring real practical benefit to both parts of the island. The contribution of the Deputy First Minister designate, Seamus Mallon, has been enormous throughout and is deeply appreciated by us all. We also greatly value the co-operation of Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the Opposition for their helpful and constructive approach to processing this important Bill and of their continuous support for the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation. The approach of all Ministers and Departments to the negotiations was extremely constructive and open. The implementation of the new Strand Two arrangements represents a major undertaking for the whole admin<Col N="1256" /> istrative system, involving a re-orientation in a way that has not happened since the foundation of this State. What is involved is a dramatic re-orientation for our administrative system.</P>
    <P>Last April, as we concluded the historic Good Friday Agreement, all of Ireland was focused on television sets as the news broke and as details emerged. There was a great sense of achievement and of goodwill. That goodwill, and the enormous support for this tremendous achievement, was further confirmed in May last, when the people of Ireland &ndash; North and South &ndash; voted so decisively in favour of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>That same desire to ensure the successful implementation of the Agreement has also been clearly manifest in the public service, who have approached the many tasks involved in a very positive spirit. I pay tribute especially to the officials in my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and in the Offices of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman and in all of the line Departments, who have approached this complex and historic project in a very positive spirit. I know that all involved will continue to do all that is necessary to ensure for the people of Ireland &ndash; North and South &ndash; the achievement of all aspects of the Agreement which they so clearly want to see succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am honoured to have this opportunity to join the Taoiseach in commending the British-Irish Agreement Bill to the House. It represents a major step forward in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and in the transformation from conflict and division to peace and co-operation.</P>
      <P>The vision of the Good Friday Agreement is underpinned and reinforced by the solid, detailed work of institution-building and this Bill will, when enacted, put many of the key elements in our Statute Book. Taken with the Northern Ireland Act passed at Westminster last autumn, and with the British order in regard to the implementation bodies now going through their legislative process, it will allow for the establishment of the North-South and British-Irish structures envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I signed, with the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, four international agreements supplementing the British-Irish Agreement signed on Good Friday. The most substantial of the agreements signed yesterday is that establishing the implementation bodies which form the basis of the great bulk of the Bill now before the House. The Good Friday Agreement said relatively little about the bodies. They would have a &ldquo;clear operational remit&rdquo; and would &ldquo;implement on an all island and cross-community basis policies&rdquo; agreed in the North-South Ministerial Council. They would also be funded on the basis that they &ldquo;constitute a necessary public function&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An indicative list of 12 possible areas for North-South co-operation and implementation <Col N="1257" /> was set out. A key element, from our point of view, was an absolute commitment that the two Governments would make the necessary legislative and other enabling preparations to ensure the bodies, once agreed, would function at the time of the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement and the transfer of powers to the assembly.</P>
    <P>The essential compromise made on Good Friday in relation to the bodies was that all the detail, including the areas in which they were to operate, was deferred to later negotiation. In return, there was a commitment that the bodies would have to be established and be ready to function alongside all the other structures as a key part of the overall institutional balance.</P>
    <P>The first phase of that later negotiation, in which we were heavily involved, culminated in the agreement reached on 18 December among the Northern Ireland parties which identified the areas in which the six bodies would be established and gave a broad description of their functions. It was significant that three of the agreed areas were not in the earlier indicative list. Trade and business development and language were both priorities of ours and of the nationalist parties. Food safety was a UUP proposal, the attractiveness and potential value of which was immediately apparent and to which we were happy to accede. The importance of the food safety issue and the logic of treating it on an all-island basis has become more obvious.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the Christmas break the two Governments began to work intensively to put flesh on the bones of what had been agreed in December. In broad terms we had to do five things. First, we had to work out in greater detail how the agreed functions would be exercised. In the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we had to give the bodies a clear operational remit. Second, we had to agree a range of common provisions in regard to accountability and reporting, financial and personnel principles and the rights of citizens in respect of the bodies. Third, we had to agree how the individual bodies would be structured. Fourth, we had to work out in broad terms what the bodies would require in terms of funding and staffing, both in the start-up phase and later on. Fifth, we had to agree a legal framework which would give us sufficient certainty that the agreements reached on all these issues would be maintained and delivered.</P>
    <P>While the primary role was for the two Governments to play, it was politically essential that the Northern Ireland parties were broadly satisfied. I am satisfied that all these objectives were adequately, indeed amply, realised in the supplementary agreement signed yesterday, as reflected in the Bill. The Taoiseach outlined the essential elements of what was agreed. I stress the particular importance from our viewpoint in ensuring that all these elements were contained within the text of an international agreement, which offers the maximum possible confidence that what has been agreed will be followed through.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> The annexes to the agreement contain a great deal of detail, while its main Articles set out the guiding principles. Article 1 of the agreement establishes and names the bodies. Article 2 provides a link to the detailed annexes. Article 3 restates the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to funding and to the accountability of the bodies to the North-South Ministerial Council. The chain will lead through the council back to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the assembly. Article 5 relates to future amendment of the functions and detailed arrangements. While this will be formally for the two Governments, we envisage that in practice any changes will be on the basis of a decision of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>An important additional safeguard put in place yesterday was that, in an exchange of letters between the Secretary of State and myself, we agreed that the two Attorneys General will consult and co-operate as necessary to address any problems which may arise concerning the interpretation and application of our respective domestic legislation in regard to the bodies. The two Governments are also committed to taking all the appropriate steps should problems arise. The adoption of an approach under which most of the substantive detail is contained in an agreement between the two Governments, rather than in separate legislation, should minimise the risk of divergent judicial interpretation.</P>
    <P>None of this was easy. It took a great deal of hard work of a highly technical character, guided at all times by an awareness of the political sensitivity of many of the issues involved. I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the role played by our colleagues in Government and their officials. I place on the record of the House that, without exception, the approach of all the Departments involved has been positive, constructive and imaginative, and that their commitment and determination have been remarkable.</P>
    <P>Yesterday at Dublin Castle I and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, congratulated the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, Paul Murphy and their officials. This was a collaborative venture, as it had to be. British negotiators, most of whom were officials of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, also worked extraordinarily hard and effectively in a pragmatic and constructive spirit. The contrast with what one reads about the post-Sunningdale experience was striking, but it reflected the ever-growing amount of practical co-operation between North and South within the public sector and beyond over the past decade or so.</P>
    <P>The Northern parties have also approached the matter in a realistic and positive way. I pay tribute to the roles played by Mr. David Trimble and Mr. Seamus Mallon and their advisers and colleagues, as well as by the Sinn Féin leadership of Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinness.</P>
    <P>All this bodes well for the future of North-South co-operation under the agreement. The success of the bodies will depend not just on what <Col N="1259" /> is legally provided for but on the energy and creativity of their boards, where these exist, and their staff. However, I am satisfied the arrangements now in place, while they will need to be actively implemented, provide an excellent springboard.</P>
    <P>In the longer run, the most significant motor of North-South co-operation will be the North-South Ministerial Council, which will bring our two Administrations together in a systematic and structured way and on a regular and frequent basis. It will oversee the implementation bodies and take forward co-operation in the other areas agreed in December, but it will also allow for the spotlight to be shone on all sectors and on all issues of mutual interest or having the potential for co-operative action.</P>
    <P>The supplementary agreement on the council signed yesterday was largely of a technical character. The Good Friday Agreement dealt fully with the role and composition of the council. However, detailed work is continuing at official level both on the practical arrangements for the council's inaugural meeting and on future procedural arrangements, including its secretariat, which will be headed at a senior level on both sides. While a final decision has yet to be taken, the likely location is Armagh, the historic and symbolic resonance of which is apparent. Naturally, the timing of these developments depends crucially on the formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland, but I assure the House that all the necessary preparations are well in hand.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement, the Bill provides for the designation by the Taoiseach of those Ministers or Ministers of State who are to deal with the business of the council or to attend any particular meeting of it. A parallel provision was made in the British Northern Ireland Act.</P>
    <P>Analogous provision is made in respect of participation in the British-Irish Council, about which a similar technical supplementary agreement was signed yesterday. Useful work has been proceeding at official level to work out detailed procedural arrangements for this council and to prepare a possible work programme which might include such issues as transport, the environment, including Sellafield, education issues, and cultural and sporting matters. While the future operation of the British-Irish Council will in practice depend heavily on the approach to be taken by its members, including the as yet unformed administrations in Scotland and Wales, our consulates in Edinburgh and Cardiff report consistent interest, as reflected in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    <P>The final agreement signed yesterday concerns the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which is to replace the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established in 1985, and which will promote bilateral co-operation between the two Governments on all matters of mutual interest, including in particular non-devolved <Col N="1260" /> Northern Ireland matters, with the discussion of which members of the Northern Ireland executive will be involved. All of the necessary practical preparations are well in hand.</P>
    <P>We are putting in place everything which is necessary for the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement. In parallel, the reorganisation of Northern Ireland Departments, and the adoption of standing orders by the Assembly, will together allow for the Strand One institutions to function as planned.</P>
    <P>To adapt a mantra of the talks, nothing will work until everything is working. All the institutions have to come into place together. That means that the difficulties over the formation of the executive have to be resolved, in accordance with the effective deadline to which we are now working, before Easter. The problems are manifest. We all know what they are and we realise how little space Unionist and republican political leaders have to move through them. It is important that they continue to talk, and that all possible assistance is given to General de Chastelain and his commission in their work. The two Governments will together make every effort necessary to encourage and achieve a breakthrough.</P>
    <P>The opportunities with which we are presented are also manifest. Those opportunities, and how they are to be realised, have been made more tangible by yesterday's agreements and by this Bill. The day to day work of co-operation and partnership may lack the intensity of division and conflict, but it is that steady, painstaking work which will give to all our people, North and South, Nationalist and Unionist, the future they want and deserve. It would be an outrage against our deepest hopes and aspirations were we now to fail. The tragic absurdity of that possibility is surely the most powerful possible incentive to success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must approach this debate with a sense of history. Two hundred years ago in this city, not far from here, the legislative assembly of the Irish people was debating a proposal for an Act of Union that was being promoted by the British Government of the day because it felt itself to be under threat from Napoleonic Europe. It is interesting that we have the space to deal in a more constructive and united way with the issues dividing us on these islands, now that we are part of a Europe which itself is becoming more united. The fact that Europe is no longer a threat to Britain means that Britain can take the sort of constructive attitude it is currently taking to the relationship it has with Ireland and, equally, now that we are an independent part of Europe, we have the capacity to take a less defensive attitude to our relations with Britain and with Northern Ireland. It is important, as we contemplate the millennium, that we see the changing relationship between Ireland and Britain and within the community in Ireland in its wider European and historical contest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> I propose to share my time in the debate with Deputy Flanagan. He will deal with the details of the legislation and I will address some of the wider political issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation before the House. It is an historic step forward. It involves this House in sharing some of its powers with Northern Ireland. These new institutions will bring people closer together. They will also have economies of scale, conducting business over a larger territory, and this will lead to efficiency. We must ensure that does not mean just another layer of Government. There must be no triplication of action or responsibility. This will be teased out in the debate as will the issue of how the body will be accountable to Dáil Éireann and to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is important that in addition to answering questions here on the annual report, the body should be seen to be responsive to the concerns expressed by Members of the Oireachtas and members of the Northern Assembly.</P>
    <P>We will also pursue in the debate the possible difficulty referred to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a difference of interpretation of the Agreement in courts in the two jurisdictions. There is not to be a single all-island court and therefore it is possible that a British court might interpret a particular clause of the powers of the body in a different way to a court in this jurisdiction. The appellate jurisdiction will be different with the Supreme Court and the House of Lords potentially coming to different decisions. The proposal is that this will be dealt with by means of consultation between the Attorneys General, but that can only happen after the event. It is not possible for the Attorneys General to interfere in a court case and it will only be after the House of Lords, as a supreme court of the UK, and the Supreme Court here have come to a different decision that the Attorneys General can do anything about it. There is not any solution to this issue. One hopes that the common sense of judges will ensure that the issue I refer to does not arise.</P>
    <P>I now come to the remaining problem &ndash; decommissioning, and the setting up of an executive. The guns are silent. That is important but it is not enough. The existence of the guns poses a threat. Loyalist and republican weapons engender fear and generate misunderstanding. Normal political interaction is difficult between parties, one of which is armed only with a democratic mandate and another which is armed, however indirectly, with other means of persuasion also.</P>
    <P>The process must be inclusive. We need Sinn Féin at the cabinet table, just as we need Unionists and the SDLP. The transition is difficult for republicans and loyalists. All of us are proud of our own parties' roots. No one is asking republicans or loyalists to disavow their past or surrender anything. We are simply asking them to recognise that they have created a new reality, and in that new reality there is no place for the gun. That is a republican achievement and repub<Col N="1262" /> licans should claim ownership of it. The defensive line they are taking on disarmament is preventing republicans claiming in full the benefits they have created for themselves and for the rest of us through their peace process.</P>
    <P>I know there are terrible memories &ndash; memories of the burning of Bombay Street, of sectarian killings and of prejudiced policing. These Nationalist insecurities must be addressed. Unionists must recognise them. Incessant demands for decommissioning that do not take account of these concerns are not always helpful.</P>
    <P>In this House we must recognise that political violence in and around Northern Ireland has had many casualties. Sensitivity is called for in dealing with the feelings of the victims of violence and also with the presumptions and beliefs of the perpetrators of violence. In a democracy based on freedom of expression, sensitivity has to be measured against the need for plain speaking and the need for truth. The greatest insensitivity of all in a negotiation is that of misleading people by concealing from them the real difficulties of their argument, thus allowing them to get into false positions when this might have been avoided if real difficulties had been highlighted earlier.</P>
    <P>We owe it to those who have died and to those who live lives of incessant pain to be realistic about actual facts and not to pretend to see in words meanings that we might like them to have but which they do not actually have. The dilemma over decommissioning shows up a continuing contradiction between the recent public statements of the Provisional IRA and the political logic of the peace process initiated by Gerry Adams and John Hume. Until that contradiction is resolved, we will not have decommissioning and we will not have security or lasting peace. Unless it is, the republican movement will continue to spawn new splinters, all able to claim that their difference with mainstream republicanism is no more than one of tactics not of principle.</P>
    <P>The core concept in the Hume-Adams approach to the peace process was that of Irish national self determination. Republicans claimed that self determination had been denied whereas other Nationalists argued differently. The peace process aimed to unite the two strands by agreeing a new method of expressing national self determination. That was to be done by having a new exercise in self determination acceptable to all, that would replace and transcend the 1918 election.</P>
    <P>Republicans had claimed since 1920 that the original Sinn Féin 1918 mandate had been blocked by the British. This unfulfilled 1918 mandate has provided the ideological and internal logic of the IRA campaigns of the past 40 years. One aim of all-party talks, which Sinn Féin demanded and got, was that they would lead to a new act of 32 county self determination to transcend 1918. In the view of the SDLP and all other Nationalists, that new act of national self determination was provided by the all-Ireland referendum on the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> The Hume-Adams document prepared by Sinn Féin in June 1992 contained two key statements which Sinn Féin wanted the British and Irish Governments, respectively, to make. First, it wanted the British Government to say that &ldquo;it accepts the principle that the Irish people have the right collectively to self determination and that the exercise of this right could take the form of agreed independent structures for the island as a whole&rdquo;. Second, Sinn Féin wanted the Irish Government to say that &ldquo;it accepts that the democratic right of self determination by the Irish people as a whole must be achieved and exercised with the agreement and consent of the people of Northern Ireland and must be consistent with justice and equality and respect for the democratic and civil rights of both communities&rdquo;. These words were drafted by Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The conditions set out in Sinn Féin's draft of the Hume-Adams document for peace in Ireland have been met by the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement. There is, therefore, no continuing justification in terms of the republican movement's declared republican principles for the maintenance of a military capacity by the IRA. There is no longer any colour of a mandate from the Irish people for the maintenance of a military capacity by the IRA. That mandate was withdrawn by the fulfilment in the Good Friday Agreement referendum of the conditions set out by Sinn Féin in the passages of the Hume-Adams document from which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Provisional IRA said the referenda on the Good Friday Agreement do not constitute the exercise of self determination by the Irish people. It is wrong. By any definition, that vote was an act of national self determination. It is wrong for the IRA to continue to deny it; it is wrong for Sinn Féin to support or condone that continuing Provisional IRA position.</P>
    <P>The position of the republican movement on the legitimacy of violence after Good Friday needs to be clarified at a theoretical level. The Good Friday Agreement contains the following words: &ldquo;All participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations&rdquo;. The Irish people, in endorsing the Good Friday Agreement, have thus voted for the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. That is not a new precondition; it is not a Unionist precondition or a Tory ruse. It is part of the Good Friday Agreement approved by the people of the thirty-two Counties of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Sinn Féin leader said before President Clinton's last visit to Ireland that &ldquo;the violence we have seen must be for all of us a thing of the past&rdquo;. This was just a statement of a wish, not a statement of what the IRA would do in all circumstances. He did not say the war is over, just that it should be over. There is a difference. The core problem comes back to the fact that the republican movement, Sinn Féin and the IRA, <Col N="1264" /> have yet to fully take on board the fundamental change in the political context of republicanism caused by the endorsement by the Irish people of the Good Friday Agreement. That endorsement was an act of national self determination which should be recognised by Republicans.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA has also stated that the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;clearly falls short of presenting a solid basis for lasting settlement&rdquo; and has repeatedly said, possibly in consequence of this, that there will be no decommissioning by the IRA. The appointment of Mr. McGuinness by Sinn Féin to liaise with the decommissioning body did not change the IRA policy on disarmament because, as Sinn Féin repeatedly points out, it is the IRA which has the arms.</P>
    <P>This duality allows the republican movement an each way bet on the Good Friday Agreement. Whereas other political parties committed themselves unreservedly to the democratic path, the republican movement has continued to date to say it will maintain its military capacity indefinitely. This is a huge political problem. It is no mere technicality or procedural precondition.</P>
    <P>The contradiction in the position of the republican movement must now be removed, and public confidence be restored, by a clear and united statement from both the IRA and Sinn Féin that, first, they now accept the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement was a valid exercise in national self determination and that it transcends the 1918 election; second, in consequence of that referendum result, the IRA war is over; third, in consequence of the IRA war being over, the IRA is prepared to disarm itself of its own accord, for its own sake and voluntarily provided the other terms of the agreement are being honoured on a step by step basis and, fourth, also in consequence of the foregoing, punishment beatings, witness intimidation and other breaches of the ceasefire will cease.</P>
    <P>The IRA said last August that it would not say the IRA war is over because it would not waste time in word games. Saying a war is over is not a word game. Words are the only tool available to democratic politicians to convey meaning. Words are important, the meaning of words is crucial. The meaning of the statement &ldquo;the war is over&rdquo; is crucial and extremely simple. It is a fundamental civil rights issue. Under our Constitution, only bodies authorised by the Oireachtas are entitled to hold arms or maintain an army. This is fundamental to any known concept of civic republicanism. One army, one state and one democratic authority, the people &ndash; that is republicanism as I understand it.</P>
    <P>Last September I said in the Dáil, &ldquo;It is unthinkable that the Dáil would accept that a politician associated with a private army, that exists in defiance of the State's laws, should simultaneously sit at a Cabinet table in this or in any other jurisdiction&rdquo;. A Member of the Government, Deputy McDaid, came into the House afterwards to criticise my statement as insensitive. Other commentators accused me of accepting <Col N="1265" /> Unionist preconditions. I am an Irish democrat and I take my positions as an Irish democrat, proud of the democratic, non-violent traditions of this State and this House.</P>
    <P>I am glad that when the Taoiseach addressed the same question I addressed in September six months later in an interview with a British newspaper, <i>The Sunday Times</i>, he took a similar view. His statement to that newspaper was one of unprecedented clarity. Asked if parties could enter Government if their military associates had not started decommissioning, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I am on record in recent weeks and months as saying that it is not compatible with being part of a government, I mean part of an executive, that there is not at least a commencement of decommissioning and that would apply in the North, it would apply in the South&rdquo;. Those were and are my sentiments, exactly. That is not and was not a Unionist precondition. It is not and was not insensitive either. It was a Taoiseach doing his job, laying down a fundamental of democracy.</P>
    <P>The peace process would be further advanced today if the Taoiseach had spoken in the same clear terms in the Dáil seven months ago on 2 September as he did to <i>The Sunday Times </i>a little more than a fortnight ago. However, we are&mdash;</P>

      <P>The republican movement needs some time to adjust to the new realities, which it can take credit for having created. Republicans need reassurance on the protection of their community. They can best get that by having their representatives sitting at the cabinet table, shaping the future of these islands through executive action. All they need to do to take their seats at the cabinet table is to make a start in fulfilling the commitment to disarmament given a year ago in the Good Friday Agreement. That is not unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This historic debate sees the placing of British-Irish and North-South relations on a new and positive footing. The signing of the Agreement last year, the address by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to this House last autumn and today's ratification of new and exciting treaties after years of cold war between our respective islands heralds a new relationship with our nearest neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note the broad remit given to the British-Irish Council under the Belfast Agreement is to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands. The <Col N="1266" /> Agreement acknowledges that the citizens of the two islands are fundamentally linked together and with each other. We have sadly ignored much of our shared experience of Celts, the Vikings and the Normans, our common sports and popular cultures and we sometimes choose to forget that more than eight million people living in Britain claim Irish origin, with more than half of them having an Irish parent. On this side of the Irish Sea, almost 25 per cent of those living on this island claim to be at least part British.</P>
    <P>The huge achievement that is the Belfast Agreement cannot be over-estimated. It acknowledges for the first time the right of those living in Northern Ireland to a dual identity. In the aftermath of the referenda in May last year, any citizen in Northern Ireland can legitimately claim to be British or Irish or both. The right to a dual identity is very important. For the first time it allows the declaration of a dual allegiance to British and Irish sovereignty.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Agreement is an act of recognition between States and peoples. We have recognised the status of Northern Ireland as being part of the United Kingdom, subject to the implementation of the Agreement. The United Kingdom, in turn, has recognised the right of the people of Ireland to exercise their national self-determination. The United Kingdom has recognised the right of Northern Ireland to secede by majority consent and to unite with the Republic of Ireland at any future time. On the other hand, we in this Republic recognise the British political identity of the Unionist community. The United Kingdom recognises Northern Nationalists as a national minority, not simply as a cultural or religious minority, and as part of a possible Irish national majority at some time in the future. The United Kingdom and the Republic recognise that paramilitary organisations are on ceasefire. Nationalists recognise Unionists as Unionists, not only as Protestants, and Unionists recognise Nationalists as Nationalists, not only as a Catholic minority. Nationalists and Unionists recognise others who are neither Unionist nor Nationalist.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, the Agreement recognises a balance of power and a sharing of power under accepted structures of democracy. This Bill and debate on strands two and three of the Agreement are based on the mutual recognition of Unionists and Nationalists and their participation in the ordered administration of justice, executive power-sharing and parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the wording of the Agreement to which I referred, I assume the British-Irish Council is not merely a forum for Government Ministers nor for Ministers and parliamentarians because the phrase &ldquo;peoples of these islands&rdquo; indicates a relationship through culture and society embracing various strands of civil society. I assume the council will commence business as a ministerial forum in view of the fact that the Welsh and Scottish Assemblies will not come into operation until perhaps early next year.</P>
    <P>In his address to this assembly last year, the <Col N="1267" /> Prime Minister, Tony Blair, spoke of improved relations. Under these treaties there will be approximately five tiers of arrangements. First, there are the intergovernmental relations, which have been in place in some respects since 1922 and which will be formalised by way of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Second, there is the interministerial aspect of the British-Irish Council, which will definitely extend beyond the British Government and the Irish Government to Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and, presumably, to other regions of the United Kingdom where regional chambers and development agencies of England may from time to time evolve into self-governing assemblies. Third, the interparliamentary tier, also adverted to in the Good Friday Agreement, will probably be an extension of the very useful and successful British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. I invite the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, both of whom are present, to initiate a debate in this House on the future of that very useful body. Fourth, reference must be made to civic society organisations and quangos. In this regard, trade unions, business, trade organisations, cultural and sporting bodies and churches have cross-island links. I refer, in particular, to the British-Irish Association, Co-operation North and many schools' liaison groups. It is important that their role and function will be preserved under the new arrangements we are ratifying. Fifth, in his speech here Prime Minister Blair was very strong on family and personal links and rightly so. Although this area is not addressed in the treaties, it forms a fundamental part of what we can describe as the totality of relations. There must be a strong interparliamentary body and an independent secretariat with an independent budget. I hope the reply to this debate will refer to this aspect of the arrangement.</P>
    <P>With particular reference to Scotland and Wales, it is difficult to forecast how matters will evolve at British-Irish Council level. The council could suffer with the increasing nationalist fervour in Scotland. The demand of the SNP for a Scottish Parliament is similar to the campaign of the Irish parliamentary party 100 years ago. The stated aim of the Scottish Nationalist Party is for the Scottish Parliament to be seen not as an event but as a process.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting the envy of the Scottish Nationalists of our Celtic tiger economy and our influence in the European Union. Our Republic has been highlighted as a role model for an independent Scotland. The role of the Scottish Nationalist Party in the British-Irish Council has the capacity to introduce matters not envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement, as Scotland and Wales face challenging and exciting time without any reference to British-Irish relations or to the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Clause 10 of strand three of the Agreement requires amplification in the context of this <Col N="1268" /> debate. We could have a joint Scottish-Irish approach to certain matters which, in essence, could operate independently of the British-Irish Council. This could cause problems for the British Government. The more energy accredited to the drive for Scottish independence, the greater the likelihood of the destabilisation of the United Kingdom. We should ask what this will do for British-Irish relations. It is very much in our interests that Britain should become more European, not less, and that the euro should be embraced sooner rather than later. A British-Irish Council with a strong Scottish nationalist hue would be likely to arouse nationalist and, hence, anti-European tensions in England, thus retarding England's and, therefore, Britain's relations with the European Union.</P>
    <P>We can itemise the importance of strands one, two and three in that order of importance. If strand one succeeds, democratic institutions in Northern Ireland will be a success and the violence, strife and inequality will be a thing of the past as normal democratic politics takes root. The success of strand two depends on the success of strand one. If strands one and two are running well, the strand three arrangement will be far less relevant. The provisions for the British-Irish Council come under strand three, which will depend, in terms of its importance, on the success or otherwise of the provisions of strands one and two.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the North-South Ministerial Council, the target date for the setting up of which has long since passed. Notwithstanding that, it is important that we should provide in law for the body in the event that the Executive is set up at short notice. The Council can and will work well and that we have changed the Constitution to ensure the Council will exercise all-Ireland jurisdiction in areas of mutual co-operation is most significant.</P>
    <P>My reading of the Council is that it will operate in a similar manner to the Council of Ministers in the European Union, with Ministers having a measure of discretion to reach decisions but remaining accountable to their parliamentary Assemblies, North and South. Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on this at the conclusion of Second Stage &ndash; how often is it envisaged that the Council will meet in plenary session and will it break up into smaller groups to deal with specific sectors such as education and health on a more regular and frequent basis? </P>
    <P>There does not appear to be any provision for a North-South parliamentary forum, as there was in Sunningdale, but the Agreement states that assemblies will &ldquo;consider&rdquo; developing such a forum. I would like to hear to views of the Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ratification of the treaty which deals with the six Implementation Bodies, the setting up of Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the Trade and Business Development Body, An Forás Teanga and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. <Col N="1269" /> The transfer of power and composition of the new boards are dealt with at length in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about accountability to the Oireachtas. There is provision for the attendance of board representatives before Oireachtas committees and the laying of reports before the House.</P>
    <P>As the European Union continues on a path of integration North and South, we will see the advantages of co-operation, given the geographical position and similar interests in problem areas such as agriculture and tourism. At present it is legally possible for Northern Ireland to join EMU with us, even if Britain remains outside, provided the Assembly, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Westminster assented to such an arrangement. This is the extent to which the bodies envisaged under the Agreement can exercise power and influence far beyond that referred to in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Andrews and the Taoiseach in paying tribute to officials North and South, and in Westminster, who have earned their place in history by their diligence and commitment in recent years. As elected representatives of the people, we acknowledge the enormous role played by officials day after day in the course of the negotiations and in the drafting of documents.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement offers all the people of Ireland a new future. This is a bright future and one worth working for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has agreed to the procedures to enact this legislation on Second Stage today and on Committee and remaining Stages tomorrow because the timetable for debating these measures has taken on a sense of urgency. I hope the manner in which we pass the legislation in this and the other House will send a clear signal to those who have work to do to complete all the components of the Agreement and will help to remove the obstacles which, sadly, still remain.</P>
      <P>In recent months, Irish politics has been dominated by two distinct problems. One is the failure of Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party to agree a compromise between themselves which will enable the formation of the Executive in Northern Ireland and secure an end to the impasse over decommissioning. The second problem has been about a compromise of an altogether different sort &ndash; the compromising of politics by the activities of a former Taoiseach and our current EU Commissioner.</P>
      <P>At the time I described the signing of the Good Friday Agreement as a testament to the craft of politics of which every member of this House could be proud. The process does not belong to any one party, it represents a victory for us all and, as such, we should all guard it closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of the disrepute that politics has fallen into, arguing the case for politics and its potential has not been an easy one in the months after the signing of the Agreement. <Col N="1270" /> Nevertheless it is one in which I passionately believe.</P>
    <P>Such is the cynicism which surrounds politics that compromises tend to be regarded by some solely as an abandonment of principle. In fact, often the opposite is true. I say this because we stand at a juncture in a peace process which can only be resolved through the principle of honourable compromise. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, the final piece of the puzzle is sometimes the hardest to place. We all know, however, that if we succeed in overcoming this hurdle few others remain.</P>
    <P>The fear of compromise and the perception of it as an abandonment of principle is perhaps most acute within the Republican movement. The history of that movement is rife with moments when short-term reality and long-term aspirations have clashed. As we know to our cost, many have paid a huge cost in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the challenge facing the Republican movement. It is also a challenge that it cannot afford to duck. It stands on the brink of an historic achievement: participation in the governance of Northern Ireland in a Government which will have organic links with the Republic of Ireland and which is prepared to work in tandem with it, on an all-Ireland basis, on a range of issues, some of which were promoted by Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>If it succeeds in moving forward, it will get the opportunity to work for the first time ever to implement change on a broad range of policy fronts. If it is serious about politics, and I believe it is, it is an opportunity it cannot afford to miss. Sinn Féin often speaks about its mandate, but, as other parties have discovered, it is difficult to deliver for people one represents if one is standing outside the doors of power.</P>
    <P>Republicans have always insisted they will not be dictated to by Unionists or constitutional Nationalists, that they will not surrender. This, they argue, is why they are not in the position to decommission any arms &ndash; or make any gesture on decommissioning &ndash; either prior or subsequent to the formation of the Executive.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin is making a classic error and endangering it's greatest achievement yet. It is Sinn Féin which has taken to using terms like surrender and, in effect, talking up the problem. Recent opinion polls suggest that Sinn Féin supporters support decommissioning and certainly do not view it in those dramatic terms. Neither do they appear to believe there is a danger of their communities being attacked, as some Sinn Féin spokespersons have suggested.</P>
    <P>The real danger is that Sinn Féin will talk up a hurdle the IRA cannot leap. To do so would put it outside even its own narrowly defined obligations on decommissioning in the Agreement. There is another way of putting things. Decommissioning or a gesture on decommissioning &ndash; it is not for me to suggest which, but I, like most other people, would be happy with the judgment of General de Chastelain &ndash; could be undertaken <Col N="1271" /> not as an act of surrender to Unionism or the British but in compliance with the most recent exercise of self determination of the Irish people in the thirty-two Counties.</P>
    <P>It would be an act of strength, an expression of confidence in the Irish people and in Sinn Fein's capacity to work the Agreement in the interests of the people who support it. It would also be an acknowledgement that prisoners are being released, Border roads have been opened and the policing system is being reviewed. It would be, to use the movement's own language, 'calling the Unionists bluff'.</P>
    <P>I have made this argument in recent months and will continue to make it to Sinn Féin. It is fair to ask, as Niall O'Dowd did in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, whether unionism is prepared to allow this process be aborted for the sake of a few guns which are not being used? The problem is that it is also a fair question to put to republicans. If the war is over, why the need for guns and semtex?</P>
    <P>I am pleased in recent days that there has been some softening of language on the part of Sinn Féin. Niall O'Dowd's piece is significant, close as he is to republican thinking. There is some movement away from the &ldquo;not now, not ever&rdquo; position which epitomised the republican position up to now. I hope this view is representative of thinking within mainstream republicanism and if it is, I urge Unionists not to be dismissive of it either.</P>
    <P>Compromise though is a two way street. I have long since argued that one of the problems in this process is that neither side, Unionist nor republican, has been prepared to put themselves inside the mindset of the other. Both find it difficult to think the unthinkable. I welcome, for instance, the meeting between the First Minister at his invitation and the President of Sinn Féin. However, I wonder if this type of meeting had taken place on a more regular basis, would the gulf between the two sides be as wide as it is? It also has to be acknowledged that the fault lies here with unionism, not Sinn Féin. Yet clearly the deep suspicion with which each side views the other, understandable in the context of the past 30 years, is the root cause of the current difficulties.</P>
    <P>Unionists can rightly point out, and I have done so myself, that decommissioning remains the only element of the Agreement on which we are yet to see any significant movement from the IRA. This is correct. Sinn Féin can hardly claim that unionism is seeking to ride roughshod over the Agreement. Nevertheless, Unionists can hardly wonder that elements within the republican movement should regard the failure to establish the Executive thus far, despite the fact that there is no stated link between prior decommissioning and the formation of the Executive, in a suspicious light, given unionism's stated reluctance to share power with Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>They must also know that the history of the past 20 years has also conditioned Nationalists with a fear of unionism's failure to face down its <Col N="1272" /> own more extreme elements. Ultimately, they know too that their best chance of achieving decommissioning and a permanent end to violence is through the operation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>All of this is the backdrop to the work that must be done between now and the new deadline established by the Secretary of State yesterday. Failure cannot be contemplated, though in recent weeks people must have begun to consider its implications, if only to concentrate their minds on the task ahead.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to be prescriptive about what must happen now. Some form of compromise or concession is clearly required, probably from both sides, as is usually the way in these circumstances. I send my best wishes and support for those closely involved in the negotiations. Today's debate, and the manner in which it has been facilitated, is further evidence of how far we have come in the past five years. At times progress has been painstakingly, but understandably, slow. However, that is hardly surprising.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today is a significant one and no doubt represents the culmination of a great deal of negotiating and drafting work. On behalf of the Labour Party, I state our appreciation, having been in Government and now in Opposition, of the extraordinary dedication and hard work done by a team of officials in the various Government Departments to which the Taoiseach has already referred, and which was endorsed by the Leader of Fine Gael and Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important one and such is the ceding of powers envisaged in the Bill that if they were being made to any other bodies other than the six North-South implementation bodies, there would be considerable opposition to it. For my part, I have argued in the past for the succession of even stronger powers to the North-South Ministerial Council, particularly more direct powers in the economic area. I did so, not in an attempt to secure more southern influence in the management of areas in Northern Ireland but rather in an effort to bind people in the Republic to the process of consolidation and compromise.</P>
    <P>I said at the time, and I am not so sure the situation has changed all that much, that a considerable proportion of the population in this State viewed the peace process as something which while it may be taking up a considerable amount of their Government's time, did not impact significantly on them. In the same vein, the council of the isles or the British-Irish Council, to give it its formal title, has not received the same attention as other aspects of the Agreement. Nevertheless, I look forward to its establishment. Britain and Ireland have many mutual interests, particularly within the European Union.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flanagan said, our relationship has evolved considerably in the past 20 years, mainly due to our common membership of the European Union. However, matters have changed considerably even in recent years. The process of devolution initiated by the Labour Government will <Col N="1273" /> radically alter the distribution of power within the UK and there is a lesson for us in that.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement empowers the council to formulate and co-ordinate policy in respect of a number of areas between its members and to fund a secretariat to assist it in this process. The Irish Government has been quick to foster relationships with these newborn administrations by establishing consulates in both Edinburgh and Cardiff. I congratulate the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs for taking that initiative. However, it is the start of a process rather than the culmination of one.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flanagan said, there is clearly growing interest in the council in Scotland in particular, as highlighted in this morning's article in <i>The Irish Times</i>. The outcome of May's elections in Scotland could prove to be interesting in that respect. I hope the council will not just promote better relations between the UK and Irish Governments and the new devolved administrations but possibly also break down national barriers. There must be a completely new set of relationships between the four nations who make up these islands and who have cross-channel and cross-sea connections of one kind or another. For instance, my party has as much in common with and, an interest in pursuing, the same policy agenda as members of the Labour Party in Wales, Scotland and England. The ultimate success of the Northern peace process for me will be when, on some issues at least, shared purpose transcends community divisions.</P>
    <P>In Government, my party benefited from the support showed by the then Opposition in respect of the peace process. Bipartisanship has been an essential component of the whole process and my party has been pleased to reciprocate now that we are in Opposition. It is unfortunate that bipartisanship has broken down in the UK. The contribution of a Conservative Party Prime Minister to the whole process will undoubtedly be recorded and that has already been recognised by the present Government.</P>
    <P>However, bipartisanship does not preclude constructive criticism of the Government. For instance, I have been critical of the pace at which some of the legislation promised in the Agreement, such as the legislation establishing the human rights commission, has been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. His Department, in both the content of legislation it has brought forward and the speed at which it has responded to the body of work required, is very disappointing and warrants severe criticism. Frankly, the Department is not up to this task, and that perhaps reflects badly upon it and, ultimately, its Minister. It is unfortunate that the whole corpus of legislation promised under the Agreement is not in place and in some instances has not even been published.</P>
    <P>The normalisation of politics in Northern Ireland remains the central aim of this process. <Col N="1274" /> The establishment of an executive is the last critical brick to be put in place to allow this process begin, and it will not be an easy one. There are forces within Northern Ireland who remain hostile to the normalisation of politics; these forces talk up the sectarian divide. These people speak the language of division, not unity, and they will have to be taken on and confronted with the contradictions of their position and with the fact that they have no democratic mandate from anywhere in this country.</P>
    <P>We do not have forever to resolve the current impasse. We are now approaching a year since the Agreement was signed. The amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution must be ratified by the Oireachtas within a year of being passed by the people. Were that not to happen because of a delay in the North and a failure to establish the last component of the Agreement's operation, the Government would be forced to seek an extension of the allowed ratification period from the Oireachtas. However, I cannot help but feel that a further deadline, on this occasion imposed by the Oireachtas, would not help matters. Moreover, the continued impasse at Drumcree does not augur well for the new marching season.</P>
    <P>Both parties to the current impasse seem to have given some thought to what might happen if they failed to reach agreement before that stage. Mr. Trimble has referred to parking the Agreement, whilst there is some suggestion that Sinn Fein would press for the implementation of some aspects of the Agreement despite the failure to establish an executive. I counsel against serious contemplation of these options.</P>
    <P>The problem with parking the Agreement may be that it proves impossible to get it going again, particularly if progress cannot be made on the issue which caused it to falter in the first place. The only real outcome that may come out of any serious consideration of this suggestion is the easing off of the pressure on both sides to find a solution to the current impasse.</P>
    <P>Similarly, while it is not wise to prejudge the options facing the two Governments in the event of the collapse of the Assembly, no one should even consider this option lightly. In that respect I welcome the statement of the Secretary of State, Dr. Mowlam, when she said that there was no plan B. It would engender further cynicism amongst the electorate on both sides of the Border and damage the political process even further.</P>
    <P>I remain optimistic that we can resolve this problem. The two Governments, the Northern political parties, the United States Government and all the parties in this House have invested too much time in this process to see it fail. Most significantly of all, it would represent a failure by us all collectively to implement the wishes of the people of the whole island, and in the current situation that would be a disastrous blow to our democracy.</P>
    <P>All sides, particularly the so-called republican movement, long sought a clear act of self-deter<Col N="1275" /> mination by all people on this island on a common question posed to them on the same day and counted in a similar manner. The result brooks no equivocation, no interpretation and no repudiation as not being freely expressed and clearly communicated. That communication is now our responsibility, and this legislation is but one component in putting that responsibility into an edifice that will enable the people of this island and those of the adjoining island to share this space as we move into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I have many questions about the operation of this legislation which will need to be answered on Committee Stage for the purpose of clarification, if not amendment. It would be remiss of the House to pass legislation of such enormous constitutional magnitude if we did not ensure that the record of the House did not contain questions regarding the operation, interpretation, meaning of and reason for certain sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is an example that is all-embracing; it relates to regulations to remove difficulties. If any Bill came before this House with the sweeping powers envisaged in this, there would be a rush to fax machines, the press and the defences of our fragile democracy. It states:</P>
    <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act or the Agreement into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Taoiseach may by regulations do anything which appears to him or her to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid, but no regulations shall be made under this section in relation to any provision of this Act after the expiration of 3 years commencing on the day on which the provision came into operation.</P>
    <P>This is a section of an extraordinarily draconian nature and sweeping scope, even given the sense of conscience at the end, when the draftsman put in some termination by including the three year time limit. The fact that this section is included and deemed necessary signals the willingness of the House to make this extraordinary democratic experiment work. We are moving into uncharted waters regarding the two parts of Ireland, and we do not want to handicap ourselves with legislative measures which may themselves become impediments to a process which is difficult enough in itself. I draw attention to this section on Second Stage to give the Government notice that clarification on this and other sections will be necessary. That is a reasonable <i>quid pro quo</i> to be sought by the Opposition, and the Labour Party in particular, given the scale of co-operation being offered in this matter.</P>

      <P>As we move towards the first anniversary of the British-Irish Agreement, it is a good time to reflect on how far we have come on the road to peace. For too long this island has suffered at the hands of the men of violence, and for too long our true potential has been stifled because of the fears and inhibitions engendered by decades of unrest. We must ensure that those dark days are behind us once and for all, and we must seize with both hands the opportunities the Agreement presents. We as politicians owe it to the people of this island to find solutions to the obstacles currently in our way. The guns have fallen silent, but we must ensure that they stay silent so that future generations will never know or experience the pain and suffering they inflicted over many years. The Good Friday Agreement is our most realistic and most tangible hope for a lasting peace. In the South we have, in recent years, experienced unprecedented economic success built on the platform of a young, well educated and well motivated workforce, a favourable corporate tax regime, a modern telecommunications infrastructure and a positive climate for industrial prosperity. We must now seek to build on that recent success so that the island as a whole can benefit from the new potential which the Agreement offers.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill marks a watershed in the development of the peace process. It is an historic step on the road to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to all the parties involved in bringing the peace process forward to this advanced stage. I join the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Quinn in paying tribute to the officials on both sides involved in the painstaking work of negotiating what is before us this evening. To the officials in the many Government Departments involved in this work for a considerable period we owe a great deal of gratitude. It has not been easy to reach the Agreement which has been reached. It is an historic one. Those of us who have been here for a considerable time never thought we would see the day when we would make provision for all-Ireland bodies. I earnestly hope we can quickly move to the point where all the institutions are in a position to go live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The historic signing of the four agreements yesterday between the British and Irish Governments, including the Agreement on establishing <Col N="1277" /> the six North-South implementation bodies, offers the potential to bring considerable economic benefits North and South together with the opportunity to move forward together in a spirit of partnership and co-operation in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>The functions of each of the six implementation bodies, including the Trade and Business Development Body, for which I will share responsibility, are set out in the Agreement establishing implementation bodies. In addition to setting out the functions of the body, the document contains details of how it will exercise its functions and particulars as to how the body will be structured.</P>
    <P>The existing enterprise support agencies North and South will continue to be funded by and operate under the direction of their respective administrations. In drawing up and agreeing the functions and activities of the body, care has been taken to ensure the role of Enterprise Ireland, established by Act of the Oireachtas last year, will not be undermined or duplicated. The new body will not have any role in relation to inward investment which will remain with IDA Ireland. The proposed new Trade and Business Development Body will complement the work of existing agencies and in some specific cases assume certain functions currently executed by existing enterprise support agencies.</P>
    <P>As provided in the Agreement establishing the implementation bodies, each body is required to operate in accordance with the provisions of the Multi-Party Agreement and in particular to implement any decisions of the North-South Ministerial Council on policies and actions relating to matters within the scope of the body's functions. Each body will be funded on a joint North-South basis as provided for in the Multi-Party Agreement.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Trade and Business Development Body will be on business development opportunities North and South. Its main functions will include developing co-operation on business development opportunities North and South; developing new approaches to business development in a cross-Border context, in areas such as research, training, marketing and quality improvement; supporting business by making recommendations to increase enterprise competitiveness in a North-South context in areas such as skills availability, telecoms, information technology and electronic commerce; promoting North-South trade and supply chains, including through business links and partnerships; promoting, under its own brand, cross-Border trade events and marketing initiatives, including identification of new areas of trade, promoting market awareness and researching measures to raise the level of trade or remove any artificial impediments to trade; undertaking other specific projects and events in relation to trade promotion when tasked jointly to do so including bringing forward proposals for consideration by the <Col N="1278" /> North-South Ministerial Council on specific projects in these areas.</P>
    <P>The body will review the scope, extent and effectiveness of relevant existing activities undertaken by agencies and departments North and South and recommend to the North-South Ministerial Council for consideration and decision areas where cross-Border co-operation would add value and ways of extending and deepening such co-operation. Specifically the body must bring forward to the North-South Ministerial Council within three months proposals on the development of a North-South equity investment fund together with proposals on placement programmes, arrangements for testing services and for implementing a standards development and certification programmes on a North-South basis for consideration and decision by the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>The body will have a special focus on the area of science and technology. There already exists a shared appreciation of the importance to economic development of science, technology, research and innovation. The body will administer a number of programmes in this area with a view to improving competitiveness. It will also examine options for the achievement of greater coherence and deepening of research and development North and South including drawing on the findings and recommendations emerging from the Foresight Initiatives in the UK and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Trade and Business Development Body will be exercised by a board which will be appointed by the North-South Ministerial Council. The board will comprise not fewer than eight and not more than 12 members. The North-South Ministerial Council will appoint a chairperson and vice-chairperson. The terms and conditions of board members will be determined by the North-South Ministerial Council with the approval of the Finance Ministers. The term of office of the first members of the board will be three years. The term of subsequent appointments may be varied by the North-South Ministerial Council to facilitate continuity of membership but shall not exceed five years. Members will not serve more than two consecutive terms. The chief executive to the body will be appointed by the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>The financial arrangements for the six implementation bodies are set out in Part 7 of the Agreement establishing implementation bodies. The &ldquo;Common Arrangements&rdquo; applying to the bodies provide for the payment of grants from voted moneys by the Northern Ireland assembly and Dáil Éireann, accounting and audit arrangements and requirements as to the keeping of accounts. It is estimated that in its first full year of operation the Trade and Business Development Body will have a budget of £11.5 million and a total staff complement of 42. In general, except for some specific exceptions, costs will be shared on the basis of 30 per cent North, 70 per cent <Col N="1279" /> South. The body will be empowered to employ its own staff by means of open recruitment, temporary secondment and the transfer of staff. Pending the formal appointment of the chief executive the functions of the chief executive will be exercised by a person to be designated by the Irish Government and the British Government.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this new Trade and Business Development Body will be of substantial benefit to business North and South. Provisional trade figures for the first ten months of 1998 show that trade continues to grow. The scope for increasing this trade and for co-operation in selling to overseas markets is considerable. In recent years, the business community North and South has provided strong and courageous leadership in pointing to the economic price of conflict and instability and in urging a generous and pragmatic approach to reconciliation. I hope any remaining obstacles to the establishment of the Executive can be quickly overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Taoiseach in recommending this Bill to the House. It is an opportunity to make a number of points on the financial and accounting aspects of the bodies.</P>
      <P>The North-South bodies will be responsible for spending taxpayer's money provided by the authorities here and in Northern Ireland. As the Taoiseach outlined, these bodies will be responsible for a significant amount of expenditure, currently estimated at about £56 million in a full year and staffing of some 880 people. This funding will be subject to the recommendation of the North-South Ministerial Council. The corresponding additional cost to the Exchequer will be in the region of £15 million to £20 million, over and above the sums already provided in the forecast estimates. For 1999, an extra £5 million to £10 million will be required for the bodies, provision for which will be made this year, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in all circumstances where money is spent on behalf of the taxpayer, it is essential that proper financial procedures are observed and that the appropriate mechanisms of accountability are put in place. These requirements are fully recognised in Part 7 of Annex 2 of the Treaty. For example, the Treaty ensures that: a member of a body or of its staff will, if so requested, appear before or otherwise co-operate with a committee or subcommittee of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Northern Ireland Assembly, in accordance with normal practice and relevant legislation in each jurisdiction; bodies will be obliged to keep proper accounts and financial records and prepare an annual statement of accounts; they must submit copies of these statements of accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland and the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General who will &ldquo;in co-operation examine and certify the accounts&rdquo;; these audited statements must be laid before the Northern Ireland <Col N="1280" /> Assembly and this House; bodies will be required to permit officers of the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland and the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General access to all necessary records.</P>
    <P>The practical day-to-day operational arrangements arising from these principles will be contained in a financial memorandum which is now being drawn up by the relevant authorities, including the Finance Departments, in both jurisdictions. This memorandum will prescribe detailed financial arrangements relating to the accounts, the accounting year and currency matters.</P>
    <P>In practice, the arrangements for accountability before this House will mirror existing provisions covering bodies which come within the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General within this jurisdiction. There will be reciprocal arrangements for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Other detailed financial management and accounting issues, such as arrangements for value for money studies and inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General of other bodies receiving grants from the North-South Bodies in both jurisdictions, will also be elaborated in the Financial Memorandum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 50 for the bodies to come within the remit of the Ombudsman in relation to actions taken by the bodies in the State. Similar provisions are being made in the British legislative proposals for the bodies in relation to actions taken in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill, together with Part 4 of the Annex, refers to the Special EU Programmes Body. The proposals enshrined in these sections were first advanced by the Department of Finance in late 1997, considered in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and culminated in the political agreement by the Northern Ireland parties to the Assembly on 18 December 1998.</P>
    <P>The EU programmes involved are the current Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme and the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. The programmes support a wide range of socio-economic activities in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. The programmes are jointly managed by our Department of Finance and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the range of functions carried out at present by the two Finance Departments, including the management and monitoring of the programmes, will be transferred to the North-South body. It will also be directly responsible for a new pro-active approach to the support and encouragement of an ever increasing range of North-South co-operative actions along the lines set out in the common chapter, first published as part of the respective national plans back in 1993.</P>
    <P>The body will have significant functions in relation to post-1999 Structural Funding. It will advise the North-South Ministerial Council and the Finance Departments on the negotiation of <Col N="1281" /> the post 1999 Community initiatives. It will prepare, for the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council, detailed programme proposals under the new Community initiatives and will be involved in the negotiations on the new programmes with the European Commission. It will also be responsible for grant-making and other managerial functions in respect of INTERREG III, the cross-Border elements of other initiatives, and any successor to the peace programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the secondment of staff already dealing with the functions to be transferred. This will be on an interim basis for a period not exceeding two years. The purpose being to ensure that there is no disruption in the management and delivery of the current programmes. The body will be headed by a chief executive, to be appointed, after due process, by the North-South Ministerial Council. The Bill also empowers the body to employ staff directly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the body shall be recognised as, and having all the attributes of, a body corporate, including perpetual succession, the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land or other property and the power to sue.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the agreement with Northern Ireland in relation to the EU programmes body is a particularly worthwhile development. The EU programmes body will provide a unique focus-point to ensure maximum complementarity and added value in the delivery of cross-Border programmes in particular, and all-island co-operation in general. It will facilitate the drafting of cross-Border EU initiatives in such a way that will ensure a coherent, cohesive, integrated and effective response to the problems and the challenges posed by the peace process.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that my Department, the Office of Public Works, was engaged with its counterpart, the Department of the Environment Northern Ireland in a joint North-South art exhibition series in 1997-98. I was honoured to open the Belfast exhibition of the series in the Waterfront Hall with my colleague Mr. Tony Worthington, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Education for Northern Ireland. In 1998, I accompanied Lord Dubs, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland to launch this significant exhibition of Irish Art in the National Arts Club in New York.</P>
    <P>Arising from this co-operative venture in the arts, my office has sought to expand the areas of mutual interest for both organisations. Accordingly, in parallel with the substantive process, my office has engaged in exploratory discussions with representatives from the Department of the Environment Northern Ireland. I was pleased to meet some of the participants in these discussions last November.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to learn that the following areas have been identified as being of mutual interest to both organisations. As regards <Col N="1282" /> structural engineering and geotechnics DOE Northern Ireland is in a position to provide technical and design support to the Office of Public Works for its arterial drainage and flood relief programmes. Office of Public Works expertise in the area of stone conservation can be provided to DOE Northern Ireland for significant renovations of major public buildings. DOE Northern Ireland may be in a position to provide limited resources to support Office of Public Works requirements in the area of quantity surveying services. In the area of Art Management &ndash; and I have already referred to some &ndash; building on the very successful North-South Exhibition during 1997, proposals are being advanced to arrange further joint exhibitions in the future.</P>
    <P>In addition to these specific areas, both sides have identified other issues of potential for future co-operation and have exchanged the information preparatory to progressing on these issues. These matters include: energy management, Government policy on architecture, office accommodation and benchmarking, training and development, the Green Design Guide and furniture supplies.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to confirm that there has been preparatory assessment of the possibilities of following through on the exchange of expertise and resources.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will be pleased to note, mine and the Government's commitment to building on this process of mutual co-operation and expanding it to the mutual benefit of both organisations which can reap benefits for the whole of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good day for Ireland North and South, and indeed for these islands, to see these provisions before the House. I hope we will see them being fully implemented because they are based on the premise that a North-South Ministerial Council will be in place. I hope all that is necessary to bring that about will take place without further delay because it is something we all want to see. It has received strong democratic endorsement.</P>
      <P>I join others in expressing my concern about the section 5 provision concerning regulations to remove difficulties, and the powers this proposes to give to the Taoiseach. Drawn as widely as it is, this would be nothing short of rule by decree in the area referred to in the section. We will have to come back to this matter and look at it more closely on Committee Stage. It is something which on first examination certainly gives rise to concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about provisions for the Comptroller and Auditor General but did not refer to the Committee of Public Accounts. Will the Minister of State make clear on Committee Stage whether it is intended that the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the bodies referred to will go to the Committee of Public Accounts in the normal way? The Minister <Col N="1283" /> of State referred to value for money audits, which are welcome.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a re-examination North and South &ndash; as much South of the Border as North of it &ndash; of the way we respect differences. Somehow, in an unhealthy way &ndash; particularly in the Republic &ndash; there is an attitude of mind which says that one is silly or out of line if one does not hold the currently accepted viewpoint. I will come back to that matter towards the end of my contribution.There was a time when to be Irish and Unionist was something to be mocked at and denigrated even though the leader of Unionism was as much a Dubliner as I am. Edward Carson was not only a Dubliner but a Member of Parliament for Dublin until the election of December 1918 when he moved to the working class constituency of Duncairn in Northern Ireland. This has been excised from our collective history. That is unhealthy.</P>
    <P>As things have transpired Unionists are to be found exclusively north of the Border. I imagine there may be some south of the Border but they keep their opinions to themselves. The reality is that we drove Dubliners such as Edward Carson north of the Border because we were not prepared to integrate in the community people with different viewpoints. Edward Carson, Solicitor General and I think Attorney General for Ireland went at the instigation of Mr. Balfour, if memory serves me to London to practice at the Bar. He had difficulty establishing a good practice because he spoke with a broad Dublin accent. Edward Carson was a Dubliner and an Irishman every bit as good a Dubliner as myself and the Minister, Deputy Woods whom I think is a Dubliner. Somehow we lost respect for people with a dissenting view. A lack of respect for differing viewpoints is part of our culture and today the Catholic Church faces intolerance. There is something very wrong in society when we are not prepared to allow people with differing viewpoints express them and be respected for it be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, non-believer, British, Irish and so on. This is also visited on the immigrants who are coming in numbers. There is a basic lack of respect for differing viewpoints. It is desire for assimilation rather than integration that is the source of many of the problems we have faced on this island.</P>
    <P>Last year in 1998 a vote was taken on the whole of the island which could be considered in any definition to be self-determination. Those who hold that a decision was made in December 1918 on self-determination must now accept without equivocation that last year, 80 years on, self-determination was determined in another direction by the people of Ireland, North and South, voting freely in large numbers. After 30 years of troubles which followed 45 years since the signing of the Treaty we have to learn to respect that people have made a decision and have on their own determined their future and want to live in peace and harmony on this island. I believe &ndash;<Col N="1284" /> and I do not often hear it articulated in this way and some may consider I am not articulating it in the right way &ndash; we have two minorities. We have a double minority problem, the Nationalists are in the minority in Northern Ireland and the Unionists are in the minority on the island of Ireland. We cannot hope for a lasting peace on the island until we respect that both minorities are entitled to have their minority status respected. That is the kernel of the Good Friday Agreement proposals. Furthermore there are to be new arrangements on the island and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>There are 800,000 people of Irish birth living in Britain. British newspapers and television channels are widely available here and increasingly our newspapers and television channels are available in the United Kingdom. Mr. Gilmartin was able to watch the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; in London. We have much in common. The British Prime Minister has family connections with Ireland. We have very much in common. I welcome the development of closer relationships. Our histories are intertwined and there is no reason that our future cannot be similarly intertwined in an agreed way. We want to see a united effort to live in peace and harmony not just on this island but within these islands and to do that we need agreed ways of proceeding which in general are provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>When we joined the European Economic Community in 1973 our <i>per capita</i> income was 54 per cent of GDP of the then poorer nine states. Now our <i>per capita</i> income is 106 per cent of GDP and more than 90 per cent on a GNP basis, that does not include transfers from the European Union, of the much larger and wealthier 15 member states and is growing at twice the European average.</P>
    <P>People have expressed concern about our assimilation into the European Union and all the terrible things that have happened and will happen as a result of membership. We have not been assimilated but have been integrated into the European Union. The pooling of our sovereignty has worked to our advantage and our sovereignty has greatly increased. We have recently concluded our fifth term of presidency of the European Union in our 25 years of membership. What would the founders of this State say if they could see that since the Irish Republic joined the EEC, half a century after its foundation, we have held the Presidency of the EU five times. They would be very proud and we should also be proud of that.</P>
    <P>The number of gaelscoileanna in existence when we joined the EEC was in barely double figures. Now there are in the region of 120 gaelscoileanna. That is not indicative of a reduction of our sovereignty and culture or that we have been assimilated but that we have grown in confidence and do not want to lose what is good about our culture and that integration is a good thing. Similarly we are not seeking to assimilate the Unionists into the Republic or Nationalists north <Col N="1285" /> of the Border and we are certainly not seeking to have the island assimilated with Britain. We are looking for integration, where people of different religious beliefs and none exist side by side and respect each other, where people with different political beliefs exists side by side and encourage each other and where we can build on the strength of diversity so that we can do for the island as a whole what membership of the European Union has done for us on a grander scale.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an integrated Ireland in which we respect each other's differences, work together to find ways of accommodating others, and feed off the richness of that diversity, as we have in Europe, there is no place for anyone operating outside agreed democratic principles. If we are to respect the double minority, as we have done, no minority within either of those minorities has the right to use violence, intimidation, and threats to impose conditions on others.</P>
    <P>The referenda passed north and south of the Border concerned the Good Friday Agreement, which includes sections on the release of prisoners, North-South implementation bodies, and decommissioning. The Agreement does not provide that decommissioning must commence or prisoners be released before April this year but it is implicit in it. If decommissioning is to be effected by April next year, it must commence sometime before then. Since it is just over a year from that date and the Agreement is almost a year old, it is disingenuous to suggest decommissioning should not have begun already or should not start in the near future. We do not know how many weapons or how much semtex is held by the Provisional IRA or loyalist organisations. If they state on 2 April next year that they have destroyed all their weapons we have no way of confirming it. However, we would know their intentions were good if they commenced the decommissioning process because it would show good faith.</P>
    <P>Recently I received a letter from prisoners in Portlaoise &ndash; I presume other Members received one also &ndash; and in reply I said my party had put its faith in the Good Friday Agreement and in every aspect of its implementation process. In response they thanked me for my attitude. My letter also stated that decommissioning must commence as part of this process, and this was not a matter of imposing something because it is implicit in the Agreement. I sincerely hope those prisoners, who have an influential role in this process, will use their good offices as other members of the republican movement should, to bring about the commencement of decommissioning. That is what the people of Ireland want. I realise this is a difficult issue for the republican movement but we must find solutions to problems, not raise problems to be solved.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, there is intolerance for new, dissenting or non-mainstream views. At present this is being visited on the Catholic Church and it does not indicate healthy or liberal thinking in Irish society that we must always have <Col N="1286" /> a whipping boy. It used to be Unionists, particularly those of that tradition who lived south of the Border. This is an indication of our lack of confidence and it is time we had more faith in ourselves. Partition has brought about a fractured confidence and, since we are trying to heal the problems which arose from partition, we should look at this in some detail.</P>
    <P>Strabane has been in NATO since 1949 but Lifford has not. The people of Lifford are good, decent and moral, but no more so than the people of Strabane. When we talk about security and defence issues, inside or outside this House, we should take on the illiberal cornerboy element which constantly calls people names whenever this issue is raised for discussion, no matter how respectfully, so that we might understand the principles on which it is based. That irredentist DUP-type thinking is prevalent south of the Border. Some say people north of the Border are intolerant, but we should look to ourselves.</P>
    <P>When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I proposed that Ireland might host the Olympic Games. Some people could not laugh long or hard enough, yet all the empirical evidence and the studies subsequently carried out, including a Price Waterhouse report, show that we could make a credible bid. I mention this because no one would think twice about Helsinki, Stockholm or Brussels bidding to host the games &ndash; they were held in Helsinki at one time, before they were profitable. It is illustrative of our lack of confidence that our initial belief is that we cannot do these things.</P>
    <P>As a Minister of State, I had occasion to visit my counterpart in Northern Ireland. When our discussions concluded and neither of us had anything else to raise, my counterpart said a senior official on his side wanted to ask me what happened to my proposal to host the Olympics. I said the matter was being pursued by the Dublin International Sports Council and that I had not lost sight of it. He said he thought we could co-operate on this venture, north and south of the Border.</P>
    <P>For some reason, we do not have confidence to look at these things. The debate should not be about whether we could hope to host such an event but whether we want to do it. An Olympics bid by Dublin would not be just for the Republic of Ireland but the whole island. Since we are neither prepared to look at it nor have the courage to put it before a Dáil committee, I hope it will be considered by one of the implementation bodies and taken away from the bogeymen, like the other issues we are not capable of discussing.</P>
    <P>Once and for all, we should put behind the unhealthy sneering at people for being Unionist, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or Muslim, or for having daft ideas about bidding for the Olympics. We should respect the right of people to suggest ideas and to have them debated. When we reach that stage, we will have built a healthy Ireland where we can thrive, an integrated, peaceful, and stable island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to have the opportunity to support this historic Bill. It is a vital foundation on which to build real and lasting peace and co-operation on this island.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the participation of the Taoiseach and Ministers in the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council. It also provides for the Taoiseach to make regulations to remove any difficulties in the way of bringing the Act or the Agreement into operation. Most importantly, it makes legislative provision for the six implementation bodies. Four of these bodies, including aquaculture and the marine, will have boards. They will each, through chief executives, manage the areas assigned to them and report to the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
      <P>The agreement of 8 March establishing the implementation bodies is another milestone on the journey under the Good Friday Agreement. I am pleased to have the opportunity to commend the Bill to the House, in particular, those provisions relating to aquaculture and marine matters.</P>
      <P>Part VII deals with the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and it is this to which I will refer. The new implementation body to be known as the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission enshrines, in a very special way, past achievements and future opportunity. As the House will appreciate the body is strongly rooted in long-standing mutual co-operation on the island reflected in the work of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These bodies have been in operation for many years.</P>
      <P>In addition to encapsulating the functions of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the remit of the new body underlines the significant potential for sustainable development of aquaculture, marine leisure and tourism, as well as inland fisheries in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. The body will also assume responsibility for inland fisheries, conservation, protection and management in the Carlingford Lough area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remit of the new body reflects general agreement that the inland fisheries resource, aquaculture and marine leisure represent very positive opportunities for economic activity. The body will have the challenging task of being a catalyst and realising those opportunities to the benefit of the communities in both of the areas concerned. In delivering on its remit, the body will start from a position of solid advantage. Strong co-operative links on inland fisheries, aquaculture and other marine matters are already well established on an all-island basis. We have similar objectives on both parts of the island to conserve, manage and develop those resources to the highest standards. Those co-operative links and shared objectives have been exemplified in the work of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, co-operation under the INTERREG Programme <Col N="1288" /> and joint cross-Border aquaculture initiatives. They will be carried through and enhanced in the remit of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and that established tradition of co-operation and achievements will undoubtedly bear fruit in the future work of the body.</P>
    <P>Part VII provides for the establishment of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission with the functions and remit which I have already outlined. The Bill provides for the vesting of the functions of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the Foyle Fisheries Commission in the new body, the extension of the Foyle functions to the Carlingford area and the additional functions in relation to marine recreation, marine tourism and aquaculture. The Bill also provides for necessary consequential amendments and repeals to the Foyle Fisheries Acts and legislation relating to Irish Lights.</P>
    <P>The House will note that under Part 6, paragraph 6, of the Agreement as scheduled to the Bill, both Governments agree the legislation required to provide the detailed framework for the development and licensing of aquaculture and for the exercise of the inland fisheries development function in the Foyle and Carlingford areas will be jointly brought forward before the end of 1999, following consultation with the North-South Ministerial Council. This additional timeframe was agreed by both sides as necessary to ensure that the quite complex legislative requirements in aquaculture licensing in particular are comprehensively addressed. I assure the House that the necessary legislation will be delivered as quickly as possible by both sides and much of the preliminary groundwork is well advanced.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights have a long and honourable history of devoted service to the seafaring community of the entire island of Ireland and to international shipping. My grandfather was a lighthouse keeper. For many years after their inception and before the development of modern ship-borne navigational systems, the lighthouses established and maintained by the CIL were the first indication of landfall for vessels approaching these islands.</P>
    <P>Uniquely, the Irish Lighthouse Service continued as a single entity serving the island as a whole following the treaty of 1921 and has continued over the years to be funded from the general lighthouse fund as part of a common system of aids to navigation for the UK and Ireland. This historic arrangement has been a concrete example of east-west co-operation over the years and I am pleased the Bill provides for its continuation into the future as a cornerstone of the new body. I assure the House that the present excellent service provided by the Irish Lighthouse Service will continue and that there will be no change in the day to day arrangements.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and thank the current commissioners and their predecessors for the excellent service they have given over the years, on a voluntary basis, together with the executive and <Col N="1289" /> staff of CIL who work so hard in the interests of safety of life at sea around the island.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new body will also mark a new era for the Foyle Fisheries Commission which has, since 1952, carried out its remit with commitment and dedication.</P>

      <P>The work of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Commissioners of Irish Lights will go on in a newly enhanced way and I know that all concerned will rise to the challenges and opportunities of the new era which this body represents.

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will outline the establishment of the implementation body for the Irish language, Ullans and Ulster Scots cultural issues, which was provided for under the Good Friday Agreement. There will be two agencies in the new body, the Irish language agency, which will exercise the functions of the body, and the Ulster Scots agency, which will exercise the functions of the body in relation to Ullans and Ulster Scots cultural issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the Irish language agency will include supporting Irish medium education and the teaching of Irish through support for curriculum materials research and methodology. This may include reviewing the curriculum resources made available for Irish medium education and the teaching of Irish, including the provision of appropriate textbooks, other teaching materials and teaching aids, and publishing the outcomes of its research and reviews, including recom<Col N="1290" /> mendations for actions, etc. This will involve the transfer of the work and staff of An Gúm and An Coiste Tearmaíochta within my Department.</P>
    <P>The new body will exercise the functions heretofore exercised by the Department of Education and Science, through An Gúm, with respect to the publication of books in Irish; exercise of the functions heretofore exercised by the Department of Education and Science through An Coiste Tearmaíochta with respect to the development of terminology and vocabulary in Irish; exercise the functions heretofore exercised by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland through the Irish medium curriculum materials unit at St. Mary's College; and, importantly, facilitate co-operation with the body established in accordance with section 31 of the Education Act, 1998. The functions exercised by my Department in relation to An Gúm and An Coiste Tearmaíochta will be transferred to the new body.</P>
    <P>The staff of An Gúm, the Irish language publication branch of the Department of Education and Science, work on the preparation of textbooks to support Irish medium education and on general publications, concentrating largely on books and publications for children and young people. There is likely to be a substantial increase in the provisions of publications of materials, including materials in or adapted to the Ulster dialect of Irish.</P>
    <P>I look forward to effective co-operation on the island as a whole in terms of the advancement of the Irish language and in the context of the development of new methodologies, research and developments on the curriculum front in respect of the Irish language within Irish medium education and in the teaching of Irish in general.</P>

Two of the implementation bodies, Waterways Ireland and An ForasTeanga, come within my remit as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I welcome the establishment of these two bodies and look forward to working with the North-South Ministerial Council in ensuring their success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to inland waterways, addressed in Part II of the Bill, the new body will have the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. The transfer of these functions will take place in two phases; phase one, to take effect initially, will see the body take responsibility for the Shannon-Erne waterway and for carrying out studies and appraisals relating to the possible restoration and development of the Ulster Canal. Depending on the results of these studies the body may be assigned responsibility for restoration of the <Col N="1291" /> Ulster Canal. Phase 2 will see the Erne system, the Shannon navigation, the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal, the Barrow navigation and the Lower Bann transfer to the new body with effect from 1 April 2000.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of my statutory powers and functions as Minister relating to inland waterways to the new body, and for the body taking over the functions of Shannon-Erne Waterway Promotions Limited. The Bill must be read in conjunction with the provisions of the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland establishing the implementation bodies approved by the House earlier today.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts in place the legislative framework for the establishment of the new waterways body and is intended to ensure the body will have the necessary powers to fulfil its important mandate. The potential for development of the connected network of the inland navigable waterways on the island for recreational purposes and, in particular, their tourism potential are considerable. For example, more than 100,000 visitors per annum are attracted to British waterways. The water recreation sector in Holland has 1.4 million clients and 100,000 vessels from abroad. My Department is fully committed to the development of the inland waterways and the Government has, with the assistance of EU Structural Funds, provided more than £20 million for the waterways development programme in the period 1994-99.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of Part II of the Bill. Section 8 is the interpretation provision. Section 9 provides that Waterways Ireland shall be a body corporate with attributes, including powers in acquisition and disposal of land and other property and to sue and be sued.</P>
    <P>Section 10(1), (2) and (3) provides that the functions of the body are as specified in Part 1, Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments and the arrangements specified in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex 2 and paragraph 1 of Article 3 to the Agreement shall apply to the body. Section 10(4) provides that the body shall not permanently close a waterway or part of a waterway without the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council. Section 10(5)(a) and (b) provide that the Minister may by order add inland waterways to the list of waterways to which the body's functions shall apply and may amend or revoke such an order.</P>
    <P>Section 11(1) and (2) provides for the transfer of the statutory powers and functions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the body. Section 11(3) provides for the transfer from Bord Fáilte Éireann to the body of its functions, assets rights and liabilities in Shannon Erne Promotions Limited. Section 11(4) provides that the powers of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands relating to scheduling of waterways pursuant to the Minister for <Col N="1292" /> Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Act, 1998, do not transfer to the new body. Section 11(5)(a) provides that the powers transferred to the body under the Canals Act, 1986, section 6(b) relating to the closing of a navigation and 7(1) relating to the making of by-laws shall require the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Section 11(5)(b) makes the same provision in respect of the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, in relation to the closing of a navigation and the making of by-laws.</P>
    <P>Section 12(1) provides for the compulsory acquisition of land by the body with the consent of the North-South Ministerial Council. Section 12(2) provides that any proposed acquisition or disposal of an inland waterway or part of an inland waterway will require the consent of the council. Section 12(3) provides that in the compulsory acquisition powers of the body, the Schedule to the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, shall apply duly amended to refer to Waterways Ireland and with any objection submitted to be considered by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>Section 13(a) and (b) provides for the repeal of section 6(d) of and the Second Schedule to the Canals Act, 1986, in so far as they relate to compulsory acquisition, and similarly in relation to section 2(f) of the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990. Section 13(c) provides that the provisions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Act, 1998 section 5(1)(a) relating to acquisition or disposal of an inland waterway and section 5(1)(d) relating to the body's powers to provide financial assistance to other persons and bodies are repealed in so far as they relate to waterways, as these issues are addressed specifically in the Bill and in the Agreement. Part 8 contains miscellaneous provisions relating to all of the bodies, including Waterways Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of Waterways Ireland which will have the important task into the new millennium of developing the inland navigable waterways on the island principally for recreational purposes and promoting the development of their tourism and commercial potential. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo chun Forais Fheidhme &ndash; Foras Teanga ina measc &ndash; a bhunú.</P>
      <P>Tá na forálacha maidir leis an bhforas teanga a bhfuil gá le reachtaíocht ina dtaobh leagtha amach i gCuid VI den Bhille seo. Freisin tá tagairtí i gCuid VIII den Bhille de nithe illghnéitheacha a bhaineann leis na forais go léir, an Foras Teanga ina measc. Tá na struchtúir don Fhoras Teanga leagtha síos i gcuid 5 d'iarscríbhinn 2 a ghabhann leis an gcomhaontú faoi na Forais Fheidhme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Feicfear ón iarscríbhinn sin go bhfuil i gceist Foras Teanga amháin a bhunú le dhá pháirt ar leith, ceann amháin ag plé leis an nGaeilge agus an ceann eile ag plé leis an Ultais. Go bunúsach is dhá áisínteacht ar leith a bheidh sa dá pháirt ar leith.</P>
    <P>Cé go mbeidh na háisínteachtaí ag feidhmiú faoi choimirce an Fhorais beidh siad beagnach neamhspleách air. Os rud é gurb é an Foras an comhlacht corpraithe is é an Foras a fhostóidh a fhoireann féin agus foireann na n-áisínteachtaí agus is leis an bhforas a íocfar an deontas-i-gcabhair ón Stát seo agus ón Tuaisceart. Ar ndóigh beidh Boird ar leith ann don dá áisínteacht, 16 dhuine don Bhord don áisínteacht Ghaeilge agus ochtar don Bhord don áisínteacht Ultals. Is iad an 24 dhuine sin a fheidhmeoidh mar Bhord an Fhorais. Aimnneoidh an Rialtas seo leath de na comhaltaí do Bhord an Fhorais agus ainmneoidh an Feidhmeannas nua ó Thuaidh an leath eile. Is trí Chomhairle na nAirí Thuaidh-Theas a dhéanfar na ceapacháin.</P>
    <P>Tá feidhmeanna an Fhorais Theanga sonraithe i gcuid 5 d'iarscríbhinn 1 a ghabhann leis an gcomhaontú. Maidir leis an nGaeilge, bainfidh obair na háisínteachta don Ghaeilge le cur chun cinn na teanga ar bhonn uile-oileánda, le comhairle a chur ar na húdáráis ó Thuaidh agus ó Dheas, ar eagrais phoiblí agus ar eagrais agus ar grúpaí príobháideacha agus deonacha eile, le tacaíocht agus maoiniú a thabhairt d'eagrais agus do ghrúpaí, le taighde agus poiblíocht a dhéanamh maidir leis an teanga, le forbairt a dhéanamh ar théarmaíocht agus ar fhoclóirí agus le tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhúineadh na teanga agus d'oideachas tri mheán na Gaeilge. Beidh freagracht ar an Áisínteacht Ultais maidir leis an Ultais agus cúrsaí cultúrtha Ultais ar bhonn uile-oileánda.</P>
    <P>Faoi na socruithe nua díscaoilfear Bord na Gaeilge, déanfar an tAcht um Bord na Gaeilge, 1978 a aisghairm, agus déanfar feidhmeanna Bhord na Gaeilge a aistriú chuig an bhForas Teanga. Ar ndóigh tá foireann Bhord na Gaeilge á haistriú go hiomlán go dtí an Foras Teanga agus tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh siad ar an aistriú sin, mar a fhéachaimse air, mar aistriú chun leasa don náisiún, don Ghaeilge agus dóibh féin. Ba mhaith liom fiorbhuíochas a ghlacadh le baill Bhord na Gaeilge as a ndíograis agus a ndúthracht i mbun chúraimí an Bhoird.</P>
    <P>Tá sé i gceist go n-aistreofar na feidhmeanna atá ag an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán i láthair na huaire maidir le maoiniú eagras áirithe deonacha Gaeilge chuig an bhForas Teanga chomh maith. Is iad na heagrais atá i gceist ná:</P>
    <P>Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge</P>
    <P>Gael-Linn</P>
    <P>Conradh na Gaeilge</P>
    <P>An tOireachtas</P>

    <P>Comhluadar</P>
    <P>Iontaobhas Ultach</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Tá go leor de na heagrais seo ag feidhmiú ar bhonn 32 condae cheana féin agus tá mé cinnte go dtuigfear go luíonn sé le réasún go gcuirfí mar sin faoin bhForas Teanga Traseorann iad. Tá solúbthacht sa socrú seo sa gcaoi is gur féidir leis an gComhairle Airí Thuaidh-Theas eagrais bhreise a chur leis an liosta nó eagrais atá ann a bhaint de.</P>
    <P>Tuigim gur féidir go mbeadh imní ar dhaoine agus ar eagrais áirithe maidir lena bhfuil beartaithe, ní amháin maidir le feidhmeanna an Fhorais ó thaobh na Gaeilge de ach maidir le haistriú cúraimí mo Roinnse go dtí an Foras. Mar sin, tá socraithe agam bualadh le hionadaithe ó na heagrais sin atá luaite thuas ar an Déardaoin chun impleachtaí an tsocraithe nua a phlé leo. Freisin beimid ag bualadh le hionadaithe ó Bhord na Gaeilge ar an lá céanna.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear tuilleadh le freagrachtaí uileghabhálacha agus le sainchumas an Fhorais Theanga nua trí na feidhmeanna reachtúla atá ag an Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta maidir leis An nGúm agus maidir leis an gCoiste Téarmaíochta a aistriú chuige chomh maith. Beidh obair thábhachtach le déanamh freisin maidir le foclóirí a réiteach agus a fhoilsiú.</P>
    <P>Suim shubstaintiall de bhreis ar £12m a bheidh mar bhuiséad ag an bhForas Teanga sa bhliain 2000, an chéad bhliain fhéilire iomlán ar an saol dó, timpeall £11m don Ghaeilge agus £1m don Ultais. Tiocfaidh 75 faoin gcéad de bhuiséad an Fhorais Theanga don Ghaeilge ón Stát seo agus an fuílleach ó na hÚdaráis sa Tuaisceart. I gcás an bhuiséid don Ultais is í an Tuaisceart a bheidh ag cur 75 faoin gcéad den airgead ar foil agus beidh an Stát seo ag íoc as an bhfuílleach de 25 faoin gcéad.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí foime tá sé i gceist go mbeidh 65 duine fostaithe ag an Áisínteacht don Ghaeilge. Cuimsíonn an líon sin foireann Bhord na Gaeilge, foireann na Roinne Oideachais agus Eolaíochta atá ag plé leis An Gúm, srl., mar aon le foireann bhreise de 19 a bheidh le hearcú a mbeidh a bhformhór ag plé le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh. Beidh ochtar le fostú maidir leis an Ultais.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte de go nglacfaidh an Dáil leis go bhfeileann suíomh uile-Éireann do chúrsaí teanga agus go dtaispeánann an réiteach stairiúil seo go bhfuil fíorspioraid an chomhoibrithe Thuaidh agus Theas le sonrú i gcúrsaí Teanga. Guím gach rath ar an bhForas Teanga nua seo.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for his kindness in allowing me time to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an historic day, although from looking at the Chamber, the public gallery and the press gallery one could understand if people did not believe it to be. However, often very important events occur not with a bang but a whimper. Perhaps that is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to the time when the new institutions created by this legislation will bring about a situation which will enable us to do as a matter of fact many of the things which have separated <Col N="1295" /> us over the years and about which we worried. The speeches by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands were workmanlike in dealing with practicalities. That is what we should look forward to.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe we were once told these North-South bodies would be the crunch issues, the important fundamentals that could break up the discussions. Let us hope there is a lesson to be learnt here with regard to another issue that is obsessing us at present. As time goes on what has been accomplished and what is being provided for in this legislation will be seen to be in the interests of ordinary people, North and South. That is what will count in the long-term, that ordinary, decent people will see that the arrangements we have made are to their practical advantage. They are not concerned with land or territory but with people, their interests and their quality of life.</P>
    <P>On Question Time I said that despite problems over decommissioning I was confident there will be a successful outcome. I said I believed that both sides had gone too far and would have too much to lose to fail at this juncture. How could any Nationalist risk loosing these new arrangements, the proposed cross-Border institutions? There is a benefit to Unionists also, not just practically but on the political level, where they have much to gain.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement, the new institutions and arrangements that have since been created and especially the emphasis on consent provide a guaranteed position for the Unionist tradition on this island. That is extremely important. It is to the advantage of Unionists as well as Nationalists and republicans.</P>
    <P>All of the new bodies are to have chief executives. There is provision for interim chief executive officers and chief executive officers from day one to enable them begin to address practical measures almost immediately. That is good. It is an assurance that we are not just concerned with talking shops. The chief executives and their staffs will have a personal and vested interest in getting things done. They will want to show that their work is important and of good to the people we all represent. There are, therefore, practical benefits to all people on the island.</P>
    <P>However, as a Northern Nationalist, and proud to be one, I am acutely aware of the importance of these new cross-Border institutions as institutionalised expressions of the Irish identity, of my identity. Partition tried to cut us off from the rest of the Irish nation. Unionists did their best to stamp out nationalism and the Irish identity. It is not that long ago where one could not register the names of one's children if they were Irish. For example, in my family those seeking to register the names Séamus and Seán were told that no <Col N="1296" /> such names existed in Northern Ireland and that the English equivalents, James and John, were to be registered. That is what appeared on the birth certificates because they were not allowed to have that expression of their Irish identity.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people to remember that there was a time when, to seek to do menial work, such as sweeping the roads or cleaning the ditches &ndash; soicas as we called them and continue to call them &ndash; which was organised by the committees of county councils, one had to take an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty, the Queen. That was deliberate, to ensure that Nationalists would not apply for such jobs. That is what our Irish identity meant in Northern Ireland within my lifetime. I raised this matter as an MP in Stormont when I inquired about the number of people who had to take an oath of allegiance to get some of those menial jobs.</P>
    <P>There were elements in this State who assisted in the development of partitionism. They did not much care about Northern Nationalists and ignored us as long as we could be ignored.</P>

      <P>&ndash;and noting that the Chairman of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters has indicated that he would respond to any request that might be addressed to him by the Clerk of the Dáil on behalf of the Oireachtas; asks the Clerk of the Dáil, on behalf of its members, to obtain from the tribunal information as to the advice it is claimed by Commissioner Flynn constrains him from making a full, immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989 and as to whether the tribunal is of the opinion that Commissioner Flynn is absolutely constrained from making a public statement in response to the Dáil Resolution or could be so released either by the tribunal or by the terms of the Resolution of Dáil Éireann of 10 February, 1999.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware of the history of this motion. Yet again, Fine Gael has found it necessary to give over its Private Members' time to deal with this matter because there appears to be reluctance elsewhere to do so.</P>
      <P>On 10 February last this House passed a motion calling for an explanation from Commissioner Pádraig Flynn. The Taoiseach communicated the contents of the motion to the Commissioner in a letter dated 11 February 1999. That motion called on the Commissioner to make a full and immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989. It also noted that the Dáil had established a tribunal to inquire into certain allegations and the necessity for the Flood Tribunal to be allowed to complete its work independently and without delay.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's letter to the Commissioner, which he read into the record of the Dáil last week, stated:</P>
      <P>I am confident that, without prejudice to your legal rights or the independence of your present position, you will wish to give careful and serious consideration to your response to the formally expressed wishes of Dáil Eireann, as the body which is the democratic voice of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The motion Dáil Éireann passed was the Government amended motion which, presumably, was placed with the full knowledge of the Government's legal adviser, the Attorney General. The House is confident the Attorney General would not have approved the Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion if he had any doubts about the appropriateness of the Dáil seeking an explanation.</P>
      <P>Why, in the absence of an explanation, should this House presume the alleged payment was in whole or in part related to the work of the Flood Tribunal? The alleged donation could, for example, relate to other matters of concern to the House not covered by the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal. For all we know, Mr. Flynn could be a witness at the wrong tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner's reply, received by the Taoiseach last week and also read into the record of the House by the Taoiseach, claimed that the Commissioner could not respond to the Dáil because he had been requested by the tribunal's representatives not to discuss or divulge to any persons the matters he discussed with the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael sought clarification from the tribunal on this matter. The solicitor to the tribunal replied that the sole member of the tribunal would respond to any request that might be addressed to him by the Clerk of the Dáil. The purpose of this motion is to give the Dáil the opportunity to direct the Clerk to request the necessary information from the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any fair observer will note that the contents <Col N="1298" /> of my opening speech on 10 February were fair, reasonable and balanced. Furthermore, the motion to which I was then speaking sought to provide due process by allowing the Commissioner a number of weeks to furnish an explanation. Not only has there been no explanation, but the Commissioner seeks to imply that the tribunal has advised him not to divulge to Dáil Éireann matters of direct concern to Dáil Éireann, that is, whether a member of the Executive received a £50,000 cheque from a man who came to discuss policy with him in his Department and the circumstances surrounding that.</P>
    <P>As I said on 10 February, the questions the Commissioner must answer are as follows. Did Mr. Flynn, while a Minister, receive a £50,000 cheque from Mr. Gilmartin? Did he receive this money in his Department office from a man who came to talk to him about departmental policy? If he received £50,000, what were the circumstances surrounding the gift and to what purpose was the money put? Did Mr. Flynn contact Mr. Gilmartin subsequent to the establishment of the Flood Tribunal to discuss with him what Mr. Gilmartin proposed to say or had said to the tribunal's lawyers? Did he seek to get him to change his sworn statement to the tribunal? If he did, how does he reconcile that with his now stated position that the tribunal's representatives requested him not to discuss with or divulge to any person the matters he discussed with the tribunal. If this advice was given to witnesses, why did he seek to discuss evidence with another witness? Mr. Flynn had no bother discussing the matter on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The House must test his claim with the tribunal by passing this motion. When it was discovered that the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, had a case to answer in relation to moneys allegedly received by him while also holding office, he not only resigned from Government but he left public life. With similar allegations hanging over Mr. Flynn, not only has he not replied to them but he expects to continue in public life and to clock up a third pension, in addition to his Dáil and ministerial pensions, in the hope that his term of office will have come to an end before the tribunal examines him or reports its findings on his evidence.</P>
    <P>Mr. Flynn's evidence may or may not relate to the work of the Flood Tribunal, wholly or in part, and may be of direct concern to the role of this House. That is why we must seek this explanation. It is not good enough that we wait until Mr. Flynn is a private citizen before we receive public explanations from him about public allegations not only that he received £50,000 but that he spent a considerable period of time trying to persuade the donor to sing from the same hymn sheet in giving an account of the circumstances surrounding the donation. The donor has claimed at all times that the money he gave was for Fianna Fáil. However, Fianna Fáil says it did not receive the money.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke to Commissioner Flynn <Col N="1299" /> on 23 December last, according to his statement in the Dáil, and spoke to him again last week in Brussels. At no time has the Taoiseach raised this matter personally with Commissioner Flynn. That is an extraordinary situation. What evidence does the Taoiseach have to satisfy himself that the alleged receipt of £50,000 by a serving Minister in totally unacceptable circumstances wholly relates to the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal? Why is he so ready to accept it does and to leave it at that? The House will be forgiven if it gets a feeling of <i>déja-vu</i>.</P>
    <P>Would this happen in any other country? Suppose Mr. Gordon Brown, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, met a man, hardly known to him, in his office tomorrow to speak to him about policy issues and he obtained from him a £50,000 cheque which he said to leave on his desk with the payee section blank and which he then retained for his own use, although the donor presumed he was giving it to the British Labour Party, which would be unacceptable in the circumstances of a person meeting a member of the British Cabinet to discuss Government business, and that Mr. Gordon Brown then became an EU Commissioner and it was subsequently discovered that he had done this, does anyone here believe he would still be an EU Commissioner although he would refuse to give any explanation except for some loose talk on the &ldquo;Parkinson&rdquo; television show? Mr. Brown would have resigned or would have been hounded out of office unless he had made a satisfactory public explanation.</P>
    <P>Why should the people be treated with the contempt and dismissive attitude of not only Commissioner Flynn but of a half-hearted Taoiseach who has not been up even one tree in Brussels in similar circumstances? Not only are these question marks hanging over the three former Fianna Fáil Cabinet Ministers, Mr. Haughey, Mr. Burke and Mr. Flynn &ndash; 20 per cent of the then Cabinet of 15 &ndash; but during the same period the procedures used for and the involvement of other Ministers in the sale of assets of the State, specifically passports and Carysfort College, remain unexplained.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution set about dividing the powers of the State. We have a Head of State, a Government, two Houses of Parliament and independent courts. Specifically, the Constitution reserved to Dáil Éireann the right to elect a Taoiseach, ratify the appointment of a Government and hold that Government accountable to it. Though the Flood tribunal is an instrument of the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is neither a court of law nor a chamber of Parliament. It is to Parliament, specifically to Dáil Éireann, that accountability by the Executive for actions of the Executive must be made.</P>
    <P>There are those who, in another context, the late Dr. John Kelly used to call the sneaking regarders, who want to buy cover for those former Ministers who have specific allegations to answer by implying that this was normal behav<Col N="1300" /> iour and that everybody was at it. There are others who want to imply that all Fianna Fáil politicians are at it. I know both of these statements to be incorrect; I said that on the record of the Dáil a long time ago. I am not in the habit of making allegations against any Member or former Member of this House. I do not relish doing my duty here this evening by pursuing this matter further, but as my party spokesperson on foreign affairs, I will do that duty without fear or favour. This House must also do its duty without fear or favour. This is not some parlour game. It is a matter of serious constitutional importance. It is a question of accountability to the people and one of accountable stewardship.</P>
    <P>To follow Commissioner Flynn's current claim to its logical conclusion, if an allegation were made against a serving member of the Government, and that member offered to appear at the tribunal to answer claims of the kind made against Commissioner Flynn, a member of the Government could claim that he or she could not answer questions in this House because a representative of the tribunal appointed by this House had requested him or her not to discuss or to divulge to any person the matters he or she discussed with the tribunal. If this were allowed to happen, it would clearly bypass the checks and balances set out in Bunreacht na hÉireann. Indeed, Ray Burke would still be in office.</P>
    <P>The Government has pulled its punches for too long on this issue. I realise there are Members of the House who find this whole business painful and unedifying, but the circumstances of this case are such that we are entitled to an explanation and we must seek that explanation. We would be failing in our duty as the public watchdog if we did not pursue this matter to the stage where we at least get an explanation. Our duty is to be watchdogs, not bloodhounds. We would be failing in our duty not to pass the motion here this evening. If we do not do so, we will have eliminated the most important check and balance provided by the Constitution, that is, collective responsibility of the Executive for the action of its members in office and accountability by those members, collectively and individually, to this House.</P>
    <P>The time has come to put an end to the prevarications of both Commissioner Flynn and the Taoiseach. Is the Taoiseach aware of the corrosive effect this whole affair is having on public confidence in the political system? The farce must stop. There must be no more embarrassing meetings in Brussels with the two sides contradicting each other as to whether the £50,000 was discussed. There must be no more unanswered letters, which are not followed up, from party headquarters. We must have no more hiding behind tribunals and lift doors. Let the facts be brought out now. The explanation required from Mr. Flynn relates to serious allegations against him as a Minister in the Government. That he be required to explain his actions is a basic function of democracy.</P>

      <P>I do not recall in my time in politics more serious allegations against a figure in public life than those levelled against Commissioner Flynn, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;allegations&rdquo;. Be that as it may, the allegations have been made and they are extremely serious. They relate to the alleged receipt by him of £50,000 ten years ago while he was Minister for the Environment. The second very serious allegation is that when he was approached about the matter by somebody from the media, he attempted to interfere with the evidence of a prospective witness to the tribunal, Mr. Gilmartin. I cannot think of a more serious allegation against anybody in public life.</P>
      <P>We have not had a response from Commissioner Flynn to these extremely serious allegations. He has not denied them and from the point of view of his public comments, there is some suggestion that he may accept the truth of these allegations and try to explain them, but we have had no comprehensive statement from him. In the meantime, he continues in office.</P>
      <P>The Members of this House did their public duty last month. They examined the issue and, while there were some differences among Members on how the resolution should be expressed, the decision of the House was to call on the EU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Pádraig Flynn, to make an immediate full statement clarifying his position on allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989. Not alone has he declined to respond to this call from Dáil Éireann, it could be suggested he has treated it with contempt. He has written a letter in response to the Taoiseach, the first formal response as far as this House is concerned &ndash; apparently he has not yet responded to the letter written to him by the General Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party last September.</P>
      <P>However, I am not focusing on that letter but on his response to the Dáil call for a full and immediate statement. Effectively, he refused to respond to that call or he is trying to do so. He used as an excuse an issue he raised after the call was first made. It can be summed up in one sentence of his letter: &ldquo;At the outset when my co-operation was sought by the tribunal, it was requested by the tribunal representatives that neither I nor my legal advisers would discuss with or divulge to any person the matters discussed with the tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not seeking details of discussions between Commission Flynn and the tribunal. They are a matter for himself. I have no idea of the range of those discussions. They could have covered all types of details or facts which are not covered by the Dáil call to Commissioner Flynn. While I make no suggestion of that nature, the discussions could have related to issues such as immunity in certain circumstances. These issues are legitimate for discussion between prospective witnesses and tribunal representatives. Discussions of that nature have taken place between <Col N="1302" /> other witnesses not just at the Flood tribunal but also at the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is not seeking details about discussions of that nature. They are not a matter for the House. One could draw the analogy further. It is possible that Commissioner Flynn might have discussed this matter with his confessor. He could have bared his soul in confession. If so, that is his own business. The Dáil is not seeking that details of discussions with his confessor, if they took place, be disclosed to the Dáil. It is seeking, indeed demanding, what was stated in the motion passed by the House, that the Commissioner make a full and immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989. This House has not yet received such a statement.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the Commissioner is entitled to raise spurious excuses for not responding to that call. Effectively, he appears to have made a strategic decision to hide behind the skirts of the tribunal. I and Members of the House do not believe he is entitled to do that. The approach we should adopt is to pursue this matter to ensure that the reasonable and legitimate call of the Dáil is given a response.</P>
    <P>It is important, in discussing the technical points of this issue, not to lose the central point. This was an enormous sum of money ten years ago. A sum of £50,000 was sufficient to buy a five bedroomed house in Dublin and that is the amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>Despite the reticence of the Commissioner's response to the resolution of the Dáil, it should not be forgotten that, in many ways, Commissioner Flynn made the decision to bring this matter into the public domain. It was his choice to appear on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; last January and to speak freely about these matters. It is legitimate to ask if he was constrained by his discussions with the tribunal representatives when he appeared on that show. While I was driving through my constituency yesterday morning, I was astounded to hear Commissioner Flynn answering a question about this issue on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; on the radio. Apparently, an extended version of the interview was broadcast on the &ldquo;Brussels to Belmullet&rdquo; show later that day. Therefore, the Commissioner was on the radio twice yesterday speaking about this issue yet he has the gall to suggest that it is reasonable to hide behind the skirts of the tribunal to explain his lack of response to the Dáil. That is absolutely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, all public representatives are responsible to the public. The Opposition has tried to deal with this matter in a reasonable manner. It is clear there is no vindictiveness on our part. When the rainbow Government came into office with Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach in 1994, the renomination of Commissioner Flynn <Col N="1303" /> was confirmed. There can be no suggestion of vindictiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>We have a job to do. All Deputies are answerable to the public, including members of the Government parties. The public is seeking an explanation. Is it reasonable that the public should have to wait a year before Commissioner Flynn might or might not appear before the tribunal? That is outrageous. In no circumstances can it be accepted.</P>
      <P>We, as public representatives, have a duty to ensure that the resolution of the Dáil is heeded. The motion before the House is entirely reasonable in the context of the response given by the Commissioner. I hope and expect that no constraint will be put on the Dáil in doing its duty. Any discussions held heretofore by Commissioner Flynn with the tribunal can be as confidential as he wishes and any further discussions he might have are his own business. That is not what is at issue. We are discussing a straightforward proposition, that he respond to the questions outlined by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell. If he fails to do so, consequences should follow.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has been given a more than reasonable opportunity to deal with this matter. At one stage in this controversy his position was described as &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;. That term was not used by Fine Gael but by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. Is it not fair to say that his position will become even worse if he continues to pursue his current argument? I will cover another issue before allowing my party leader to intervene briefly in this debate.</P>

      <P>What reasonable effort did the Taoiseach make since he first became aware of this allegation? I do not know how far back this goes. Perhaps he might tell us that some time. It seems no effort of any consequence was made by him to get to the truth. As Taoiseach, leader of the party of which Commissioner Flynn is a member and given that he was treasurer of the party at that time and would have been responsible for dealing with the sum of money that was alleged to have been payable to the party, surely he has a duty in this matter. He has been lax in the performance of that duty. When he talked about the recovery of moneys to the Fianna Fáil party, it struck me that the statute of limitations would come into play if he continues to deal with the matter in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether one is in Government or Opposition, <Col N="1304" /> a member of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or the Progressive Democrats, we all have a duty in this matter. It is not a pleasant one, but one we must all discharge. We will not be forgiven by the public if we fail to do so. That is why we must insist on the call of the Dáil being responded to. If that step is not taken by the Commissioner, we must follow this matter to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene briefly in the debate to express my appreciation to the Government, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and other Ministers for accepting the thrust of the Fine Gael motion. The amendment tabled by the Government to our motion is reasonable and acceptable.</P>
      <P>It is important that we understand that those who hold high political office must operate to a different standard from a normal defendant in a criminal case or a normal person whose activities may be the subject of investigation by a tribunal. A defendant in a criminal or any other case or a non-public figure appearing before a tribunal is entitled to refuse to answer questions and to say he or she will give answers when he or she appears before a tribunal. A different requirement applies to those of us who hold responsible public office at a particular time. If one is a member of a Government or a Commissioner, one is in a different position from an ordinary citizen who might be the subject of an investigation.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Flynn failed to understand that in the response he gave to the House which the Taoiseach read out. His response was not unreasonable for someone who thought he or she might appear before a tribunal or might be the subject of legal proceedings and wanted to keep his or her powder dry. That is perfectly reasonable, but Commissioner Flynn is not in that position. He is one of our most prominent office holders. He holds an office he obtained because of decisions taken by Members of this House. If this House asks for information, he has an obligation to give answers. He had no right to seek to use the arguments he advanced in regard to his dealings with the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I do not believe, although we will know the answer in due course, that the tribunal imposes any absolute constraint on people answering legitimate questions on subjects upon which they may subsequently be examined by the tribunal. Any answers Commissioner Flynn may give in public now to the questions put to him by the Dáil would be of advantage to the tribunal subsequently in the sense that they would be in the public arena and open for examination by everybody well in advance of the oral hearings of the tribunal in respect of which Commissioner Flynn could be a witness. By giving his answers in good time, there would be more opportunity for everyone to examine them and test them against other evidence and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the answers are perfectly reasonable, as one must assume they are although we do not have evidence to that effect yet, there is no difficulty <Col N="1305" /> for Commissioner Flynn in giving reasonable answers now which he proposes to give subsequently to the tribunal. If the answers are reasonable, they will be as reasonable now as they would be in ten months' time when they are unveiled to the tribunal. If they are reasonable, they are reasonable at any time. What problem should Commissioner Flynn have in giving them to the tribunal? </P>
    <P>In seeking to adopt the posture of a defendant in a criminal case and stating that he would not say anything that might incriminate him, he is raising more questions than ought to be raised. He was ill advised politically in the course he took. I am not so certain that legal advisers are necessarily the best people to advise one on what is the right thing to do in a political circumstance. If his answers are reasonable, as one must hope they are, there is nothing to be lost from giving them now. If, on the other hand, his answers are not reasonable, that is another question. That is all the more reason we should insist on getting them now. We cannot have someone holding office who is under a cloud. The Taoiseach expressed such an opinion on one or two occasions. It was reported in one of the newspapers that he suggested that under the new code of conduct that will apply to his party, people would have to be only accused and they would be out the door, although I am sure he did not say that.</P>
    <P>The course we are adopting here is good and I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on his magnanimity and statesmanship in accepting this motion.</P>

      <P>Only last month the Dáil debated the Fine Gael motion which asked EU Commissioner Pádraig Flynn to give a full and immediate explanation concerning the allegations regarding Mr. Tom Gilmartin. When I spoke in this House on 10 February on the motion, I called for the Commissioner to give such an explanation. I stated that the Government believed a clarification would be in the interests of all, including the Commissioner. The Commissioner responded and I welcomed that. The Taoiseach, to whom the response was addressed, indicated that the reply goes some way towards explaining the position, and that we have to respect Commissioner Flynn's right to have the matter fully dealt with by the planning tribunal.</P>
      <P>During the last debate, while calling on the Commissioner to make a statement, the Government at the same time expressed its concern that this House should avoid, either unwittingly or otherwise, acting in a manner which would constitute attempted political interference in the ongoing work of a tribunal established by the House. Those concerns remain as valid for the purposes of this debate, perhaps even more so.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely vital that the greatest caution should be exercised in dealing with a tribunal of inquiry. The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments was set up with the express purpose of establishing, among other things, whether there has been any corruption in the planning process. The Dáil must leave the tribunal to get on with its work of establishing the truth. As we have stated before, the time to debate the matters under discussion in the tribunal is when the tribunal has reported. It is only in the most exceptional circumstances that there should be any departure from that principle. In such circumstances it is of paramount importance that the wording of the relevant motion should be framed in a way which protects the independent nature of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the special public circumstances of Commissioner Flynn's position. It also recognises those circumstances mean there should be no misunderstanding of the constraints, if any, placed on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was against this background of balanced consideration of all relevant factors that the Government considered the Fine Gael motion. The Government's position is that it can accept the thrust of the motion to the extent that it seeks to obtain clarification from the tribunal. It could <Col N="1307" /> not, however, accept the terms in which the motion was expressed.</P>
    <P>The Government's concerns about the wording of the motion can be traced back to its roots in the letter which the Chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party wrote to the tribunal directly last Thursday. The Fine Gael letter expressly implies that its purpose was to obtain a reply from the tribunal which would help it decide whether it should use its Private Members' time to debate the matter. It is not acceptable that a political party should seek a statement from an independent tribunal of inquiry to assist it to decide its political strategy.</P>
    <P>From its response, it is obvious the tribunal of inquiry was placed in a difficult situation by Fine Gael. The letter sent to the Fine Gael Party, a copy of which was sent to the Clerk of the Dáil, stated the sole Member of the tribunal &ldquo;considers that it would be likely to create an undesirable precedent if the tribunal were to comment to any political party or individual in relation to the confidential working of the tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The tribunal did, nevertheless, state that it would respond to any request that might be addressed to it by the Dáil. Where the Dáil decides that it needs to so address itself to the tribunal, it is vital that it would do so in a considered and even-handed fashion.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the wording of the Fine Gael motion did not meet these tests. This is clear from the opening words of motion where it calls on the House to note &ldquo;with dismay&rdquo; the content of Commissioner Flynn's letter &ndash; that is a call for the House to make a judgment which we, its Members, are not in a position to make. We cannot prescribe terms of reference for a tribunal of inquiry which asks it to carry out preliminary investigations in private and then express feelings of dismay when those private investigations are not divulged on request.</P>
    <P>We cannot place the tribunal in a position where it is expected to make public detailed, confidential advice on private preliminary investigations which it may have given to any witnesses or informants to the tribunal. Equally, we should not ask the tribunal to make a determination on how much information any person should divulge, notwithstanding being requested to keep such matters confidential. We would be tantamount to asking every witness in the tribunal to discuss his or her proposed evidence in public in so far as such disclosure would not breach any limit on disclosure which the tribunal asked to be respected. That would be the outcome of the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>The special public circumstances of Commissioner Flynn's position mean that there should be no misunderstanding of the constraints placed on him. The Government has therefore tabled an amendment which proposes to ask the sole Member of the tribunal to state whether tribunal representatives requested Commissioner Flynn or his legal advisers not to discuss with, or divulge to, <Col N="1308" /> any person the matters discussed with the tribunal and whether the Commissioner is free to make a full statement.</P>
    <P>The main advantage of the amended motion is that it will ensure there is clarity regarding the positions of the tribunal and the Commissioner without putting the tribunal in an impossible position by asking it to determine in detail how much the Commissioner can say publicly about his evidence. There is nothing more we can or should do without stepping over the boundary of what is proper.</P>
    <P>I genuinely appreciate Fine Gael's response to the Government amendment. By agreeing to it, the party found it possible to recognise that there were deficiencies in its own motion. Its attitude is a vindication of the balanced and careful consideration which the Government has given to this matter. It is also an indication that the party accepts the Government's bona fides in this matter.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have made it clear in the past, and I state again in the House this evening, that I want to see the planning tribunal getting to the truth. If there has been wrong in the past, I want to see it rooted out and I want to see the system cleansed.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that I will introduce two important Bills affecting local authorities later this year. The first is a major local government Bill, the publication of which will mark the 100th anniversary of our present system. Drafting is also under way on a planning and development Bill which will modernise and consolidate all aspects of planning law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>These Bills are relevant to the subject matters which are currently before the Flood tribunal. As I stated in the House last summer when the Government introduced a motion extending the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal, the various legislative and administrative reforms which I am bringing to the planning system will be for nought if the public does not have confidence in the planning and political systems.</P>
    <P>It is in everyone's interest to establish the truth now, to lift the dark cloud of suspicion over the planning system, local authorities and public representatives, and to start afresh, renewed and reinvigorated.</P>
    <P>The great majority of elected representatives and officials work honestly and diligently. They deserve to be vindicated. I hope the two tribunals now operating in Dublin Castle will serve to bring to light any past wrongs and ensure they cannot recur in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad there is agreement on tonight's motion, I am not convinced that debating it serves as positive a function as we would wish. A committee of this House completed a report last week on proposals for additional ethics legislation. It is clear there is a need for it. As Chairman of that committee, I had the opportunity to study a large amount of <Col N="1309" /> material concerning ethics legislation in other countries. It put some of our difficulties in context. It also points up the need for a more effective way to deal with them. I thank all the Deputies involved for their help in doing a difficult job. One of the points frequently made by those who have studied ethics regimes in public life in various jurisdictions is that invariably the politicisation of issues demeans all those involved and all those in public life who are not involved. We need to find a method to ensure these matters can be dealt with without damaging the body politic.</P>
      <P>In this instance, it is agreed by all sides that a political donation of £50,000 to one individual, especially in a politically sensitive position, needs explanation. If reliable evidence is provided that it was intended for the Fianna Fáil Party, its recovery must be pursued, though it is difficult to see how this could be of benefit to Fine Gael or any other party. This donation may also have been relevant to the other tribunal.</P>
      <P>However, the fundamental point is whether this motion makes an explanation more or less likely, whether it makes the work of the tribunal more or less difficult, and perhaps even more importantly, whether it makes more difficult consequent action in pursuit of any wrongdoers who may be found to exist. That consideration must be uppermost at all times when debating matters such as this.</P>
      <P>I want to consider the motion in the context of the lessons Parliament can learn from it in shaping future legislation and policy. We also have to look at the effect of the motion in the short-term. The Minister dealt with some of its shortcomings and undesirable side effects. One element of the motion as put down is the public duty argument. There is some merit in that. However, we are operating in a political context and there has been a wide political sweep to the contributions so far.</P>
      <P>This is a political institution and we all accept the reality that on occasion, the Opposition sees opportunities to embarrass the Government which are sometimes too good to pass up. In this instance, a &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; motion was originally intended. This was reconsidered for various reasons; it was clearly considered politically unwise. The background to that involves the present negotiations in Europe, Objective One status etc. and a question I heard put to the Minister for Finance last week as to whether the Commissioner was in our corner on this issue. This sets at naught the attempt to present the House's concern with good behaviour in that context. Clearly, there is an element of &ldquo;Tadhg an dá thaobh&rdquo; which decides that a more cautious approach is taken because there are political considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a little more imagination had been applied to this motion, it would have served at least two other purposes, first it would support the tribunal rather than undermine it and second, which would have been more important in the long-term, it would set down a marker for the future <Col N="1310" /> as to what kind of behaviour is acceptable. When we are discussing matters as serious as this, saying the political life of this country is at stake, we should opt for the more serious approach.</P>
    <P>The effect of the motion is not what is intended in mere political terms. There are serious implications, some of which have been mentioned by the Minister. In the world of <i>realpolitik</i>, those who put questions to embarrass opponents already know the answer. It would be daft for any party to put down this motion if it was not certain the answer would show that what the Commissioner stated in his letter to the Taoiseach was incorrect. If that is the case, it begs the question of how it knows that. Has someone received information from a tribunal source which suggests the Commissioner's letter was incorrect as regards the advice given by the tribunal? In normal conversation, one would not reach that conclusion, but in the world of <i>realpolitik</i>, one knows what is being suggested in a motion such as this.</P>
    <P>These questions must be asked. I hope there has not been any leaks. However, the question is a political one and the proposers of the motion could have made it more clear that that was not part of its intent. The response from the sole member of the tribunal to the correspondence from the chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party and to the Clerk of the Dáil which was laid before the Dáil last Friday states that the sole member does not wish to be unhelpful, but considers that it would be likely to create an undesirable precedent if the tribunal was to comment to any political party or individual on the confidential working of the tribunal. That is a very important point. It is a marker that any tribunal needs to put down and is one we would ignore at our peril. It has been indicated that the member would respond to a request addressed by the Clerk of the Dáil, on behalf of the Oireachtas, which is interesting.</P>
    <P>The relationship between this House and the tribunal is a very formal one. It is laid down in Statute and the resolutions of the House establishing a tribunal and its terms of reference set that down. Under the Tribunal of Inquiry Evidence (Amendment) Act, 1998, a tribunal may request the Houses to change its terms of reference. Under the resolutions of this House, the tribunal, which is, in effect, the sole member may report to the Houses at various times and on various aspects of its investigation. No other communications are provided for and once established, the integrity and independence of a tribunal ought to be respected within the parameters laid down for it. That is why we have Standing Order 56.3 which states that a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner as that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal. The motion, as amended, overcomes that consideration. However, the original motion, which required a judgment, would have had serious implications. Even as it is, it seems to have fundamental implications for the work of <Col N="1311" /> the tribunal, which is engaged in dialogue, written or oral, with this House or a political party.</P>
    <P>All sides need to remember that a great deal of public trust and money has been invested in the two tribunals currently sitting. The public want them to work, as do the Members of this House. They want them to make findings and they want to see the facts established. There is a great deal of interest in both tribunals because of what has been uncovered. There is amazement in this House, not to mention the public arena, at some of the matters unearthed. However, the public not only wants to establish the truth, it also wants to see issues pursued subsequently in the courts, if necessary.</P>
    <P>If anything is done in this House or in any form, which provides a defence for someone being investigated by the tribunal in subsequent criminal proceedings &ndash; and there are clear legal precedents established in this area &ndash; then a very grave disservice will have been done. Public money, which in the first instance was made available to be used constructively and to good effect to expose most undesirable activities, will be perceived by the public to have been misused. We need to state clearly that this House and all parties have confidence in the tribunal. If anything else is the case, that also needs to be stated and there are actions consequent on that which must be looked at. It must be said clearly that this House has confidence in the tribunal, it wants it to continue its work and it is committed to not undermining it. If I was seeking information from the sole member of the tribunal, he could be asked for his views on section 3 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Evidence (Amendment) Act, 1979, which amends section 1 of the Tribunals Act, 1921. This deals with the matter of witnesses before tribunals. One could then think of Mr. Flynn's contributions to &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and yesterday's programme, as mentioned by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. Other witnesses' statements, including that of Mr. Gilmartin, could also be considered. It would be extraordinary if the actions of this House were to undermine the tribunal when we should be looking for a means of strengthening its role and a way of ensuring tribunals in their present form would not be required.</P>
    <P>This debate and others have raised questions about the efficacy of the tribunal mechanism. Parliament places great trust in a tribunal by setting one up and places great demands on it, that some find unreasonable. One could clearly envisage developments which would require changes in the terms of reference of a tribunal, and one frequently hears of a tribunal being criticised on the grounds that if its terms of reference had been correct, it would have performed more effectively. If that is the case, we must learn from it, but having set up a tribunal, it is surely in nobody's interest to undermine it.</P>
    <P>Neither am I suggesting that this House should have no right to debate issues before a tribunal. <Col N="1312" /> I see nothing wrong with the Oireachtas debating issues before a tribunal. What concerns me is going the step further of being seen to interfere with the process of a tribunal, and in the context of what we are discussing tonight, we could be open to that charge. The Dáil has an obligation to consider matters of public interest and concern, and since there is no timescale for the completion of any tribunal's work, it would be unreasonable to suggest that matters before a tribunal could not be debated. It would be very foolish to pursue matters in such a way as to interfere with or undermine the work of a tribunal. Tonight's debate is sailing close to the wind on this score, and it would require much legal consideration to accept tonight's motion.</P>
    <P>Something that must be kept on the agenda as long as it takes &ndash; perhaps forever &ndash; is that the people are disgusted with what the tribunals have turned up and what is perceived to have happened in public life. Members will know we are all tarred with the same brush, and that is greatly resented. It has the most serious and fundamental implications for the work of Parliament. On one hand, we need to establish what and how things went wrong; we also need to establish what facilitated and allowed it to happen, as well as determining what can be done to ensure the framework no longer operates in the closed fashion it has done. Some of the allegations remain allegations, while others are accepted as truths, but a new focus must be set to ensure this is not repeated in future. In fairness to the tribunals, and to the Houses for setting them up, their effect has been, on balance, very positive. They have shown it is possible to probe the undergrowth and to find facts often alluded to but never before proven. That will not be the case until the tribunals present their findings, but the evidence suggests there will be interesting matters for debate. It is not necessary for the Houses to wait for the tribunals to present their reports before acting to change legislation. There are at least three committees working in this area, and the Government, at the Taoiseach's instigation, put forward proposals late last year which were considered by the committees. It is important that is realised and that action is taken on foot of it. That action needs to be well thought out and the fundamental points need to be addressed. In the interim, the rights of the tribunals to pursue the matters referred to them without undue interference have to be respected, notwithstanding this Parliament's right to continue to examine issues of public concern. We must at all times be careful not to undermine the findings of the tribunals, particularly if further action is required at a later stage.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to explain Pádraig Flynn's famous appearance on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;. There is a charitable explanation that there was a chemical imbalance and that he was on some sort of high. It certainly looked like that. He did not speak on the programme; he <Col N="1313" /> shouted and lorded it over the rest of us. In subsequent interviews in Brussels he was more subdued, as in the famous interview where the lift doors closed on him. Last week he was back to his more expansive, ebullient self. He met the Taoiseach and referred to him as &ldquo;Taoiseach Bertie&rdquo;. The Taoiseach did not look like a man following someone who allegedly stole £50,000 from the Fianna Fáil coffers; he looked bemused and slightly edgy. His attitude to the whole affair is incredible, and people do not understand what the Taoiseach is so complacent about.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reluctance to pursue this matter is baffling and disquieting. The Progressive Democrats' willingness to brush the matter under the carpet undermines their credibility as a party of integrity. With Deputy O'Malley's famous speech they marched up the hill, but with the Tánaiste's return from Australia they marched back down again. This is a party with no backbone and which has lost its moral authority; it will and has compromised its principles for the perks of power.</P>
      <P>Pádraig Flynn has very serious allegations hanging over him. He is alleged to have stolen £50,000 destined for Fianna Fáil's coffers, and he is alleged to have interfered with a tribunal witness to ensure their stories matched. It appears he is getting away with it, but I have brought up the mechanism to compulsorily retire a Commissioner in the House before, Article 160 of the treaty setting up the European Community. We were told that was the case, but the situation has changed somewhat. Commissioner Edith Cresson is under scrutiny. Other Commissioners, with the exception of Pádraig Flynn, are pursuing Edith Cresson and asking for her resignation. We should do likewise and put the pressure on Commissioner Flynn. These are very serious allegations and his situation, as Deputy Harney said, is impossible. We have been given a number of explanations for his behaviour, one of which was that it was a personal donation. If it were a personal donation he would have to account for how he could manage to spend £50,000 during an election campaign. Some £14,000 is probably the maximum he would have spent at that time on his campaign. It is difficult to believe the Gilmartin donation of £50,000 was a gift and was not to be used for election purposes. An explanation also doing the rounds is that he was prohibited from speaking about this at the request of the tribunal. This explanation is much too convenient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another explanation is that we cannot televise the proceedings of the tribunal because apparently Justice Flood would not agree. I have in my possession a letter from Justice Flood who said this is a matter for the Oireachtas. Deputy Killeen said the people want this matter pursued. I agree. The public want total transparency and would welcome the proceedings of the tribunal being televised. Justice Flood has told us the ball is in our court. All parties should pursue this matter. It is in our interest and that of the public that the proceedings be televised. While Vincent <Col N="1314" /> Browne's radio programme is excellent with actors playing the part of James Gogarty etc. there is no substitute for the proceedings being televised. This is an issue the Green Party will pursue.</P>
    <P>The explanations do not add up. In relation to the former Deputy, Ray Burke, we were told donations destined for Fianna Fáil went into his back pocket. We were told a number of individuals in Fianna Fáil knew about this, including Deputy Seán Fleming, Des Richardson, Pat Farrell, the General Secretary, that they informed Mr. Haughey but no one else knew. Apparently the Taoiseach knew nothing about this when he appointed Deputy Burke.</P>
    <P>We have been told also that only one individual, Seán Sherwin, knew about the donation to Commissioner Flynn. We are all members of political parties and know how they operate. Sometimes we go for a pint and have a little tittle tattle. Are we supposed to believe no one knew about these donations, that no one ever spoke about it? If that is the case, Fianna Fáil is very different from all other parties in the House, because we all talk to each other. There is gossip and the usual tittle tattle. Yet we are asked to believe these individuals in Fianna Fáil are the souls of discretion and did not tell anyone. I simply do not believe that and I do not think anyone believes it. One explanation is that people did know but because it was commonplace in Fianna Fáil at the time they did not bat an eyelid. I believe people knew and people know who knew. Eventually they will speak out. If Ray Burke decides to come to the tribunal and sing it will be the end of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has kindly offered me two minutes to correct a few points which have arisen. Both the Minister and Deputy Killeen were at pains to point out that Fine Gael was in some way trying to interfere with the workings of the tribunal. That is far from the truth. It was Dáil Éireann, in fact a Government amendment, that requested Commissioner Flynn to make a full statement. Given that he replied saying he could not make a full statement because he was constrained by some legal imposition imposed on him by the tribunal, it is only right that we should find out what that constraint is and how it arose. The reason for tabling this motion &ndash; I am glad the Government amendment more or less coincides and we can accept it &ndash; was to establish whether he can or cannot make a full statement. Let us not cod ourselves, certain matters will arise which are not within the remit of the planning tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley mentioned one particular donation which was in the public domain. It was not put into the public domain by Fine Gael or any other political party but by some leak. I refer to a donation given by the Fitzwilton Group through Rennicks. It was stated that a former Minister and a former Member received a sum of £30,000. It was clear that donation was meant for <Col N="1315" /> the Fianna Fáil Party. The Fitzwilton Group is entitled to donate money to the Fianna Fáil Party or any other party. That is within the law. So far as the Fitzwilton Group is concerned the planning tribunal will not investigate that matter because it does not relate to any planning issue. The terms of reference of the Flood tribunal refer to planning issues. This was simply a donation given to an individual to pass on to his political party. It appears that £20,000 of the £30,000 disappeared. How can the Flood tribunal investigate that issue? In fairness to the Fitzwilton Group, how can that matter ever be cleared up? It will not come out in any tribunal. There are times when we in this House have to pursue issues. It is our responsibility as Members of the Opposition to ask the Government questions. In the time I have been a Member and for as long as I remain a Member, I have no intention of denigrating anybody's character. I intend to ask questions but it is up to the person to respond. If a court or a tribunal investigates something, so be it. An Opposition cannot be gagged in asking the appropriate questions when these issues appear in the media and are a cause of deep concern to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has had to revert once again to matters relating to the £50,000 donation allegedly received from Mr. Tom Gilmartin in 1989 by the then Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party. This is due to the refusal of Commissioner Flynn to respond adequately to the motion passed by Dáil Éireann on 10 February and the failure of the Taoiseach to follow the matter up with the vigour required.</P>
      <P>Since this allegation first came into the public domain the attitude of Commissioner Flynn has been totally inconsistent. He has chosen on some occasions to comment publicly to the media about these matters, as in the infamous &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; interview, and has opted on other occasions to shelter behind a claim of legal impediment to making a comprehensive public statement or answering questions on the grounds that he is due to be a witness before the Flood tribunal. A week ago the Taoiseach read into the record a letter from Commissioner Flynn in which he responded to the motion passed by the Dáil on 10 February by saying that because he was due to be a witness before Mr. Justice Flood, it would be inappropriate to make a public comment on the matter. Yet yesterday listeners to RTE radio heard Commissioner Flynn comment freely on his &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; interview, outline his views on political and personal financial contributions, deal with his relationship with Mr. Gilmartin and offer an entirely new and hitherto unheard explanation for his controversial telephone call to Mr. Gilmartin in the immediate aftermath of the original <i>Sunday Independent</i> story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that when Commissioner Flynn <Col N="1316" /> receives an official request from Dáil Éireann to make a statement on these matters he seeks refuge behind legal advice from the tribunal &ndash; advice that he claims to have received but that we have not seen or heard &ndash; but when somebody puts a microphone in front of him, he feels free to comment without any legal restraint.</P>
    <P>It is important to restate that when the story first appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last year suggesting that Mr. Gilmartin had made a £50,000 donation to Mr. Flynn for the Fianna Fáil party, there was little political response. Most Members of this House took the view that it was most appropriate to leave the matter to the Flood Tribunal. However, it was Commissioner Flynn who made the issue a matter of legitimate public and political comment when he gave his extraordinary interview to Gay Byrne on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; on 15 January.</P>
    <P>The matter was made a further subject of legitimate public and political comment by the fact that on the weekend of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; the Taoiseach's media handlers were busy decrying Commissioner Flynn's RTE appearance and making it clear that he had now no prospect of reappointment to the Commission for a third term.</P>
    <P>Following &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and further public comment by Mr. Gilmartin, my party leader, Deputy Quinn, was the first Member of this House to publicly call on Commissioner Flynn to make an immediate statement responding to the allegations made against him. In a subsequent statement he said that notwithstanding any investigation by the Flood Tribunal, issues pertaining to people who hold high office must be answered. He said: &ldquo;It simply is not acceptable that respect for our democracy should be further diminished by allegations of wrongdoing which are left unanswered, possibly for months or even years, concerning senior politicians&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the time, the Labour Party and Deputy Quinn were accused by some Government representatives and by a number of commentators of going over the top, but the subsequent course of events have borne out the validity of our position. Had Commissioner Flynn made a comprehensive statement at the time setting out the facts as he saw them, dealing with the basic questions that have been raised, then the matter could probably have been regarded as closed until such time as Mr. Justice Flood was able to deal with it in much more detail.</P>
    <P>Instead, the way in which Commissioner Flynn continued to try and duck the issue and evade answering any questions on it, coupled with the reluctance of his Fianna Fáil colleagues to even ask the relevant questions, has simply added further to public cynicism about politics in general.</P>
    <P>What are the basic facts we already know and what are the issues on which we require answers? What we know is that Mr. Gilmartin claims that in 1989 he gave a contribution of £50,000 to Mr. <Col N="1317" /> Flynn, which he says was intended for the Fianna Fáil Party. This donation was made at a time when Mr. Flynn was Minister for the Environment and when Mr. Gilmartin was seeking to advance a huge development project in the Dublin area. Mr. Flynn has not, at any stage, denied receiving this money.</P>
    <P>We also now know that the money in question was not apparently received by Fianna Fáil headquarters. It has also been claimed by Mr. Gilmartin that as far back as 1989 he made the Fianna Fáil national organiser, Mr. Seán Sherwin, aware of the fact that he had given Mr. Flynn the donation in question. Despite this, it was only ten years later, when the matter came into the public domain, that the general secretary of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Mackin, actually got around to writing a pro-forma letter to the Commissioner asking what had become of the money.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions that arise both for Mr. Flynn and for the Fianna Fáil Party which can be answered without prejudicing or prejudging the work of the Flood Tribunal. Mr. Flynn should state simply and directly whether he got the money from Mr. Gilmartin. He should outline the circumstances of the donation and say whether all or any part of it was passed on to the Fianna Fáil party. If the money was not passed on, he should indicate how he spent or applied the money.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Fianna Fáil Party, it should say very clearly when it first became aware of Mr. Gilmartin's donation and why it took no action for ten years to establish what happened to the money. The failure of Fianna Fáil to pursue this matter is one of the most puzzling aspects of this bizarre affair. Fifty thousand pounds was, by any standards, a massive donation in 1989. This sum would have been enough to fund a general election campaign in several constituencies, yet Fianna Fáil apparently did not take any action to recover the money or to establish what happened to it. I am sure that even Fianna Fáil, for all the legendary generosity of its backers and for all its success in fundraising, would have regarded this as a substantial donation and would have wanted to locate it and put it in the bank.</P>
    <P>However, an even more fundamental question arises. If Mr. Gilmartin made a donation which he intended to be passed on to the Fianna Fáil Party, and if the money was not passed on as intended, is there not a danger that a criminal offence may have been committed and that there could have been an obligation on the appropriate personnel to bring the matter to the attention of the Garda? If members of the committee of a small sporting or social club heard that somebody had made a donation of £50 to an individual, which had not been passed on, one would expect that they would have made more effort to recover it than Fianna Fáil apparently did in the case of Mr. Gilmartin's £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has adopted something of a mantra about ethics and politics. I do not ques<Col N="1318" /> tion the genuineness of the Taoiseach's desire to see new ethical standards in politics and particularly within his own party, but for him to have the credibility to do so, it is essential that he confronts wrongdoing by those in his own party in the past and imposes appropriate political sanctions on those responsible. This is the only way to lance the boil.</P>
    <P>At successive Fianna Fáil Ard Fheiseanna we have heard him talk about looking to the future and setting new ethical standards for political life. However, we have yet to see or hear the Taoiseach denounce the sort of wrongdoing that has been well documented on the part of a number of those who have held very senior positions in the Fianna Fáil Party and in Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>Despite all that emerged in the evidence to the McCracken Tribunal and despite the findings of Mr. Justice McCracken in his report, I have yet to hear the Taoiseach condemn in the unequivocal way that every citizen would expect, the improprieties, irregularities and downright abuse of public life perpetrated by his predecessor and political sponsor, Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the extraordinary failure of Fianna Fáil, including during the period since the present Taoiseach has been leader, to follow up on the Gilmartin donation. We know that at the time the first allegations were made against the former Deputy, Mr. Burke, the Taoiseach claimed to have &ldquo;been up every tree in North Dublin&rdquo; following them up. It subsequently emerged that what this tree climbing amounted to was simply to ask Mr. Burke in a casual way if anything was bothering him, and to send the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, off on a fool's errand to London to interview Mr. Joseph Murphy. We also know that Fianna Fáil headquarters were aware for many years that Mr. Burke had passed on only £10,000 of the £30,000 he received from Fitzwilton in 1989 &ndash; that most successful and financially rewarding of years for senior Fianna Fáil personnel.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach's promises of new ethical regimes might be taken somewhat more seriously if he showed some enthusiasm for establishing what happened in the past. Fianna Fáil has now taken to claiming credit for the establishment of the tribunals of inquiry, conveniently forgetting that in the case of both the Flood and Moriarty inquiries, Fianna Fáil initially stoutly resisted all demands for their establishment and conceded only under intense and sustained pressure from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Initially, Fianna Fáil spokespersons rubbished the suggestion that the Dáil should call on Commissioner Flynn to make a statement. I recall in particular the comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who said the initial motion on this matter &ldquo;may well constitute an attempted political interference in the ongoing <Col N="1319" /> work of a tribunal established by the House&rdquo;. He then went on to deliver a eulogy in praise of Commissioner Flynn and compared him, in passing, to the Birmingham Six and the Guilford Four. Clearly, that speech was written before the Government recognised the writing on the wall and had to table its own amendment calling on Mr. Flynn to make a &ldquo;full and immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we know from the letter read to the House by the Taoiseach last week, Commissioner Flynn, despite being a long serving Member of this House, has decided to thumb his nose, to ignore the motion passed by the Dáil, and has again sought refuge behind supposed legal advice from the tribunal that he should not make any public statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted the general thrust of the initial Fine Gael motion on this matter. If Mr. Justice Flood confirms that the advice given to Mr. Flynn was as suggested in the Commissioner's letter, then clearly the Dáil will have to accept that and await the matter going before the tribunal. However, if it turns out that the statement made in Mr. Flynn's letter to the Taoiseach was misleading or inaccurate, or did not truly reflect the advice given to him, then it will add to the seriousness of the Commissioner's behaviour and leave the Dáil with little alternative but to return to the matter and take appropriate action.</P>

      <P>Before Private Members' business I was saying that as a Northern Nationalist, I am acutely aware of the importance of the new cross-Border bodies as institutionalised expressions of my Irish identity. Partition was used to try to cut us off from the rest of the Irish nation. Unionists did their best to stamp out our nationalism and, the educational system, to the extent it could organise it, was oriented to Britain and we were not even allowed to use names such as Séamus or Seán. When my brothers' godparents went to register their birth, they were told no such names as Séamus or Seán existed in Northern Ireland and were asked for the English equivalent. Many people do not realise the extent to which an alien loyalty was imposed on people. As a Member of Parliament in Stormont in the late 1960s, I tabled parliamentary questions on the number of employees of central Government, local govern<Col N="1320" /> ment and its committees who were forced to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen as a precondition to getting a job. This applied even to what could be described as menial jobs such as brushing the streets, cleaning the drains or as we call them in the North cleaning out the seoch. The Unionists went to this extent to stamp out our nationalist identity. I am sorry to say it was not only in the North that our Irish identity was questioned. Some in this State questioned our Irishness and there are some who still do. Partitionism over the years of separation became a fact of life, sometimes in the most unexpected quarters, as I found through personal experience including an occasion in this House. We Northern Nationalists were a nuisance and were disrupting the nice cosy arrangement in a State which in many respects is the Northern equivalent of a Protestant State for a Protestant people. Successive Governments of different complexions were good at verbalising on republicanism but in practical terms ignored us until we forced them to pay attention in the last 1960s.</P>
      <P>These new arrangements will be a challenge not only to Unionists but to those of a partitionist mentality in this State. There may be some truth in the assertion, not always a jocular one, that the best future for a new Ireland might be a 32-county new Ulster. I do not know how things will evolve, where working together North and South, Unionist and Nationalist will take us. I cannot be sure where we are going. I hope it will develop towards greater unification on this island, but by consent, which is crucially important. Consent is central and fundamental. Without it there is no way forward but there is no inevitable future. The late Cardinal Conway, in the aftermath of Sunningdale, put it very well, I thought, when asked on an RTE programme about the way forward. Catholics and Nationalists were involved in Government in the then power sharing Executive. Asked to comment on what effect that would have, would the fact that Catholics and Nationalists were being treated as equals reconcile them to the Northern State or would it have the opposite effect, spur them on to a united Ireland and give them greater confidence in working towards that goal, the Cardinal, with whom I had my disagreements, was very wise when he replied he was prepared to leave the answer to those questions to history. I think we have no alternative but to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the officials on a job well done. I have long admired the expertise and dedication of the State's officials in their dealings with the North. I remember when they first started to arrive in 1969 and for some of them it was very strange, an alien place in which it required courage to operate. They travelled North taking the views of everyone. Some of them have deservedly reached very high ranks in this State and in the EU as well, for which I congratulate them. The Northern Ireland civil servants, some of whom I knew very well in their previous capacities, deserve credit for the way in which they have <Col N="1321" /> adapted to the changing conditions over the years. When I think back to the attitude of Northern Ireland civil servants in the 1960s and 1970s, I marvel when I meet them today at the way in which they have changed. I also welcome the co-operation of officials who in the past, certainly in the post-Sunningdale era seemed more concerned about their own empires in this jurisdiction and in the Northern jurisdiction than about the new possibilities. That was a fact of life. It looks as if it has changed and I hope it has. I give credit to the Taoiseach and to my party leader, Deputy Bruton when as Taoiseach he made it very clear publicly and privately that he would brook no attempt to retain positions to continue with empire building at the expense of new developments.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Armagh is the likely location for the ministerial council. I am not surprised at that. Mr. John Taylor was utterly opposed to the Council of Ireland in 1974 but like a good constituency man and a resident of Armagh he is very much in favour of the headquarters of the Council of Ireland being in Armagh. Séamus Mallon has a constituency interest in Armagh as well and it is likely that the location of the headquarters of the North-South ministerial council is a foregone conclusion. The British-Irish intergovernmental conference will replace the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference established in 1985. It will look after devolvement matters. I hope its role in this respect will decrease as time goes on, as the representatives of the two traditions work together in Government to solve the political, social, economic and cultural problems and this should encourage them together to seek the return of devolved powers.</P>
    <P>Irish Nationalists and republicans ought to get back from London any power they can, especially as regards policing, the next big difficulty facing the process. Only when policing is returned to the hands of people in Northern Ireland will it have a proper policing system, and it will eventually come. Any administration which cannot enforce its writ is a eunuch &ndash; the late Brian Faulkner believed that, and he was right. If real power is to be shared in Northern Ireland, these functions should be returned there.</P>
    <P>Since no one else has done so, I praise the officials at Maryfield. They had a tough task and a difficult life. It was a hardship posting which was called, for good reasons, &ldquo;the bunker&rdquo;. I pay tribute to those who served, at considerable stress to their brains, hearts and, in some respects, livers, and for the job they did in circumstances of some danger to themselves.</P>
    <P>In that regard I emphasise the importance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, because what has happened now would have been more difficult, perhaps impossible, without the British-Irish context established in that Agreement. The Unionists learned an important lesson then, because it was the first time they realised their <Col N="1322" /> writ would not run despite their efforts on the streets.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Council, described by some as the &ldquo;Council of the Isles&rdquo;, involves Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands and provides an interesting new context. I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which is already considering making changes to its operation. I hope the Unionists will join us at long last.</P>
    <P>This is an historic day which reminds me of a passage in White's <i>A History of Italy</i>, describing how over the course of a century the Italians clawed their way to the top of the mountain to reach a plateau where they expected to find a completed city but instead found building blocks. To some extent that is the position we are in today. I am also reminded of what Mr. John Hume, M.P. keeps saying <i>ad nauseam: </i>&ldquo;Now is the time for the spilling of our sweat and not of our blood&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As previous speakers have said, today is of great significance as the Government presents this historic legislation to the House. It gives me immense pleasure that food safety, which is in my area of ministerial responsibility, should be the subject matter of a North-South implementation body, to be called the Food Safety Promotion Board. Previous speakers have mentioned that the significance of the legislation is the implementation of part of the Good Friday Agreement and we hope we can bring that to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>Food safety issues and food-borne illness do not recognise political borders. The two jurisdictions, North and South, form one island; many of the issues of food safety are common to both and it is only practical we should both work to address these issues together on the island on which we cohabit. In this context, the establishment of the Food Safety Promotion Board builds on co-operation that previously existed at official and operational level on food safety in the two parts of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office, this Government has attached particular importance to food safety generally and the concerns of consumers in particular. It recognises the need for uncompromised and independently verifiable assurances on food safety to ensure consumer confidence. As I stated last year during the passage through the Dáil of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, the primary purpose of the FSAI is the protection of consumers. The Government also recognised that one of the best ways of promoting the Irish food sector was to put in place a strong, independent and science-based food safety authority, which <Col N="1323" /> would have the confidence of consumers both at home and abroad. The establishment of the Food Safety Promotion Board will provide this reassurance for the whole island. The board should not only contribute to public health, but will also serve the economic development of the Irish food sector on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government has recently published its &ldquo;Food Standards Agency &ndash; consultation on draft legislation&rdquo; wherein it proposes the establishment of an independent agency to protect public health and to raise standards across the food industry. The establishment of the Food Safety Promotion Board is therefore timely when the legislation and administration of food safety systems North and South are changing.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the Agreement establishing implementation bodies provides for the establishment of the Food Safety Promotion Board. The board will provide an independent assessment, through independent scientific advice, of the safety and hygiene of food produced, distributed or marketed on the island of Ireland. However, the respective food safety enforcement agencies North and South will continue to be responsible for inspection and enforcement in their own jurisdictions. Likewise, existing arrangements for international negotiations, the setting of food standards and the promulgation of legislation and regulations will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>The body will draw on the pool of scientific advice and expertise already available North and South. It will establish and maintain links with key interests in the food safety field including the Northern Irish and Irish food safety enforcement agencies, namely, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in the South. The body will have an advisory board and an advisory committee, both of which will be appointed by the NSMC, The committee will comprise scientific experts and representatives of broader food safety interests.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to elaborate to the House the functions that will be vested in the implementation body on food safety, which are as follows: the promotion of food safety; research into food safety; communication of food alerts; surveillance of food-borne diseases; promotion of scientific co-operation and links between laboratories; and developing cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing.</P>
    <P>The body will have responsibility on an all-Ireland basis for the promotion of food safety and hygiene. Promotional activities will include holding conferences, providing food safety advice, and developing initiatives targeted at the public, professionals responsible for food safety and the food industry. The Northern Irish and Irish food safety enforcement agencies will retain their existing promotional role to support their inspection and enforcement functions.</P>
    <P>The body will identify priorities for research and will commission and fund projects as necessary to fill identified gaps. A database of research programmes will be established and maintained. <Col N="1324" /> Research findings will be disseminated to relevant interests. The FSAI will retain a research role in relation to its functions while taking into account the research activities of the Food Safety Promotion Board.</P>
    <P>Information on national and international food alerts will be disseminated by the body. A cross-Border emergency response procedure will be developed, including training for personnel involved. Joint action in communicating food alerts will ensure consistency of approach and maintain consumer confidence. Cross-Border co-operation in the microbiological surveillance of food-borne diseases will include promoting harmonisation in the development of surveillance systems. Surveillance data and information will be exchanged between the National Communicable Disease Surveillance Unit, its Northern equivalent and other interest groups.</P>
    <P>Linkages will be developed between scientific experts North and South. This will assist the sharing of experience on test methods and surveillance. A system for rapid access to laboratory results will be developed. Linkages between laboratories will facilitate easy access to data and exchange of information. The development of a strategy for the delivery of specialised laboratory services for the island of Ireland will include a study of the relative cost effectiveness of the available options, including use of laboratories in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a historic day and I am pleased to commend this legislation to the House. I pay tribute to all who have worked so tirelessly over the past few weeks to bring the negotiations on these six implementation bodies to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill as an essential step in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which was endorsed by 85 per cent of the people of Ireland last year. We in Sinn Féin were party to that Agreement; we recognised it as an historic compromise for which all parties took political risks. Not the least of those risks was taken by Sinn Féin. We accepted key elements of the Good Friday Agreement which challenged political positions we had held for many years. We altered our party's constitution to allow attendance at an assembly in the six counties; we urged a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the 32 counties after a painful and heart-searching internal debate and despite our reservations &ndash; shared by broad sections of opinion on this island &ndash; about changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see the Agreement as a vehicle for change in which we can all make the journey towards a just and equal society, leaving behind the injustices of the past and the conflict which has arisen from them. This is not a final settlement and there are many aspects of the Agreement, including the institutions which are established in the Bill, which do not go far enough. The extent of all-Ireland bodies is too limited. We are con<Col N="1325" /> cerned at the minimising of their scope at the insistence of the Ulster Unionist Party. However, like the other aspects of the Agreement, these institutions can be built upon as the historical, political and economic imperative moves the divided parts of our island, and the divided sections of our people, ever closer together. It is up to all of us to create that imperative.</P>
    <P>If the Agreement as negotiated was being implemented, then the Executive, the all-Ireland Ministerial Council, the all-Ireland implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference would have been established by now. Power could then have been transferred to those bodies and to the assembly tomorrow, 10 March. This could and should have been the case. I am disappointed and gravely concerned as is Sinn Féin that this deadline is being allowed to pass. The Irish Government should have taken a much stronger position, insisting that the Agreement as negotiated be implemented in the agreed timetable.</P>
    <P>It is not talking up a crisis to state the plain fact that there is a crisis in the peace process. This crisis exists because the Ulster Unionist Party, for the past 11 months, has been allowed to elevate one element of the Good Friday Agreement above all others. I say &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; because I am also disappointed that both Governments have indulged that party in its pretence that the entire Agreement hinges upon a decommissioning gesture from the IRA. This false position was given expression in what can only be described as a disgraceful editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday, 8 March, which argued that it would be better that the entire Agreement should founder than that decommissioning should not take place in the way that is being demanded by Unionists.</P>
    <P>The decommissioning issue is being dealt with. It is as complex as any of the other issues addressed in the Agreement. We in Sinn Féin have fulfilled and will continue to fulfil our commitment in that regard. Everyone needs to recognise the duplicity of the simplistic approach which talks of decommissioning gestures. One only has to remember the theatrical and choreographed hand-over of weapons by the Loyalist Volunteer Force some months ago. Armed members of this same force appeared before RTE cameras last weekend and threatened to end their ceasefire. The so-called decommissioning carried out by the LVF was valueless, a propaganda stunt by an organisation whose ceasefire is unstable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to opinion polls and the views of republicans. I can reflect those views more accurately than any interpretation of a particular opinion poll. In Nationalist and republican districts in the six counties, the decommissioning issue is seen in the context of increasing attacks and threats from loyalists as referred to at the Taoiseach's Question Time today, and of continuing revelations about decades of collusion between British forces and loyalist paramilitaries; it is seen in the context of more than 130,000 <Col N="1326" /> licensed weapons in the Unionist community; it is seen in the context of the continuing siege of the Nationalist community on the Garvaghy Road; and it is seen in the context of an unchanged, heavily armed RUC and a British Army which may be less visible in some areas but which is still present in large numbers, with all its infrastructure intact. I urge Deputies Quinn and John Bruton to come with me to South Armagh and to speak to the people there about decommissioning under the din of helicopters and under the shadow of dozens of hilltop posts, checkpoints and barracks.</P>
    <P>People need to look beyond the Unionist rhetoric about decommissioning and look at the real motivation. The mask slipped recently when David Trimble and John Taylor spoke of moving forward without Sinn Féin. Unionists look to the prospect of the expulsion of Sinn Féin from the process, the breakdown of the broad republican consensus in favour of the Agreement and the splitting of the IRA from top to bottom. The sad reality is that many Unionists and significant and powerful sections of the British military establishment would relish such a prospect. They seek a defeat of Irish republicanism, a defeat that could not be achieved through 30 years of conflict.</P>
    <P>An international commission was established to deal with the issue of decommissioning. Its work continues and Sinn Féin has worked with it. The issue is not resolved but the lack of resolution of this issue, like all the other issues in the Agreement which remain unresolved, does not prevent the formation of the Executive now. What is being allowed to prevent it is the lack of political will on the part of the Ulster Unionist Party. I urge the Irish Government not to allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>In spite of the negative political context in which this Bill comes before us, it represents a tremendously positive development in the history of our country. It points to a new political dispensation for all the people of Ireland. The failures of the past &ndash; partition, sectarianism, one-party rule and repression, among others &ndash; can be set aside and we can begin a new era of equality. Let us cast aside the obstacles and enter that new era.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised by the tone of Deputy Ó Caoláin's comments. It is alarmist to talk of Unionists vetoing or blocking progress on full implementation of the Agreement. It is wrong of the Deputy to state that some element of the Unionist community is trying to push ahead with the Agreement without his colleagues in Sinn Féin. It is not often I get the opportunity to quote Fergus Finlay in a positive light but implementation of the Agreement without Sinn Féin not is worth a penny candle. That was the truth when Fergus Finlay stated it in the lead up to the Agreement being made and it is also true now. There is no point in proceeding with the Agreement if we do not have the full partici<Col N="1327" /> pation of Sinn Féin and the other groups which negotiated and signed off on that Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Agreement is predicated on consent and the agreement of all parties who signed it. Deputy Ó Caoláin is correct, it depends on their goodwill. They should obey not just the letter but the spirit of the Agreement. Nobody should move ahead without the consent of others or public support.</P>
      <P>The Agreement is being held up because of a dangerous and damaging obsession with decommissioning. It is a dangerous issue on which to get hung up. Deputy Ó Caoláin is correct to highlight the unease in the Nationalist community about guns legally held mainly by members of the Unionist community. Republicans of every stripe, including those who previously engaged in violence, should not become obsessed with the security agenda. There is a much wider agenda. We are right to adopt an upbeat and positive tone about the legislation. It is the first small practical step towards reaching agreement between the peoples who inhabit the island and have separate allegiances.</P>
      <P>I am a republican and have not supported the use of violence during the past 25 years. We can reach political agreements and resolve our difficulties in a peaceful manner. That is what the Agreement is about. It is not about an over-emphasis on decommissioning. Good sense should prevail. It should be realised that there is no point in concentrating on decommissioning if the mindsets and attitudes of those who have resorted to violence do not change. There is a need for reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Decommissioning is a sensitive issue for republicans. It is noteworthy &ndash; I studied history in university &ndash; that no republican group has ever surrendered weapons. I, therefore, warn members of the Unionist community not to push the issue too hard. The Agreement depends on the goodwill of all participants.</P>
      <P>There has to be decommissioning and a timetable set. I would, however, reject an empty gesture and empty rhetoric. There must be a tangible reduction in tension brought about by the guns used to deny the most fundamental right of all &ndash; the right to life. We should push ahead and implement the Agreement. It is in its implementation that its true worth will be seen.</P>

      <P>The two parts of the island, which for generations have been divided, are interlinked. These links will be strengthened by the historic treaties signed yesterday and being ratified today. The leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, set out the historical and contemporary context of the legislation. He praised all the parties involved and stated that further progress is linked to decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> The legislation is a further historic step forward. It will bring the people of the island closer together. The functions set out in the sections dealing with Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the trade and business body, the special EU programmes body, An Fóras Teanga and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will give Ireland a keener competitive edge in the European Union as well as over our other trading competitors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the new bodies. Politics is the winner. Politics is about honourable compromise. That is what was achieved in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the areas on which I am spokesperson. Sport has been a great catalyst in uniting the peoples in the two parts of the island. In the appointment of the new Irish Sports Council in 1997 the importance of bringing the people of the island together under the umbrella of sport was acknowledged through the appointment of a representative of the Northern Ireland Sports Council. In turn, a representative of the Irish Sports Council was involved in the development of different aspects of sport in Northern Ireland. Co-operation has been achieved in the area of coaching. The Northern Ireland Sports Council has been involved in the development of the drug testing and education programme in this jurisdiction. Sport, through competition, participation and enjoyment, has broken down and will continue to break down barriers.</P>
    <P>The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will have the capacity to develop marine tourism in the areas under its jurisdiction with obvious benefits for the Border counties. There will be an extension of his functions to cover the development of angling and marine tourism. I am surprised, however, that the development of tourism in general has not been included.</P>
    <P>In a discussion document published earlier this year my party set out ten key objectives essential to a healthy and developing tourism industry on the island. One of these objectives is an effective marketing of Ireland as an island destination. The peace process offers a unique opportunity to market Ireland on an all-island basis through a genuine North-South co-operative approach. Greater funding must be provided to promote the tourism industry throughout the island as the potential of tourism promotion on an all island basis cannot be realised without adequate resources or proper structures. Coupled with a marketing approach must be the enhancement of tourism development in the Border region through the INTERREG programmes.</P>
    <P>Why has tourism not been included in the programmes set out in the legislation? The need to market Ireland effectively on an all island basis has long been recognised. It was recognised by the previous Government and Bord Fáilte. This must be done in a sensitive manner avoiding the errors made by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in his unilateral abolition of the <Col N="1329" /> agreed marketing logo. This serious political error damaged the goodwill and enthusiasm towards a joint approach. Did this lack of judgment bring about the downgrading of tourism in the legislation? How can the development of tourism on an all island basis be achieved?</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, announced that legislation would be introduced to establish a limited company to market Ireland on an all-island basis. I assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the necessary resources would be available to achieve this goal. If early agreement can be reached on this issue, an excess tax to market tourism in this jurisdiction might not be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate. I have numerous contacts, through the GAA, in the northern part of the country. I am familiar with the difficulties and problems the Nationalist community face. Nationalists should be happy with this development. The structures being established under the legislation have great potential.</P>
      <P>This is part of a long drawn out process, which will be challenged and come under pressure, to ensure peace is achieved. I also hope it will mean that both communities in the North will feel secure in their homes and villages and that they will feel part of the wider community they can be proud of, as epitomised on sporting occasions when members from both communities play together.</P>
      <P>The almost unanimous approval of this legislation in this House reflects a maturity one would not have expected ten years ago. The distance travelled by Fianna Fáil in accepting this Bill and abandoning Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution &ndash; sacred cows for that party &ndash; and the way it has come around to the Fine Gael approach is extraordinary. It reflects a maturity which we in this House will need in the weeks and months ahead because these have been trying times at official and Government level.</P>
      <P>There are people from both communities in the North who do not want this process to work, who will hinder any progress. The fine officials working in the North will face a testing time and that will not change with the passing of this legislation or the establishment of the Executive.</P>
      <P>I have a specific interest in one of the implementation bodies, the trade and business development body. I work on a twinning group between Listowel and Downpatrick and we are in the process of developing a five year plan. Business will be very much at the centre of that. I see a major role for such relationships within the framework of the body. We are a small group, but I see great potential for similar groups to interact with the body, including the presentation of proposals. Will it be possible for a group like ours to meet this body, make proposals and seek funding? It would provide us with a means of developing the relationships between Listowel and Downpatrick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> There is a triangular connection between San José in the Silicon Valley, California, Derry and Listowel on which we have been quietly working over the past six or seven years. People travel from the Silicon Valley to Listowel and on to Derry. Both sides have benefited in different ways, Derry through companies such as Cegate and north Kerry through tourism, culture and other aspects. I see great potential for this kind of development, not only within but beyond the island.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Ó Caoláin is not present. I often speak to him and we understand each other. Eilis O'Hanlon of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> sums up politics in Northern Ireland. She is the authority on how people think there. When I want to understand what is happening I read her articles. Deputy Ó Caoláin should read her article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday. The headline asked: &ldquo;Will Sinn Féin ever grow up?&rdquo;. She went on to say that letting Sinn Féin into the Northern Ireland Executive is one way to ensure that decommissioning will never happen. That is the bottom line. If Members wish to get a good understanding of what is happening in Northern Ireland they should read her articles because she has her finger on the pulse.</P>
    <P>I agree with my party leader, Deputy John Bruton on the issue of deommissioning. For the past three years it has been the issue requiring resolution and he has not wavered in his approach. The Taoiseach has come around to his way of thinking. There must be some decommissioning before we make progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The politics of Northern Ireland has in many ways had the most profound and unfortunate consequences for both North and South over the past 30 years. I served on the New Ireland Forum in 1984. It gave me an understanding of dealing with the politics of Northern Ireland and with North-South relations. The fervour with which issues were dealt with in the early 1980s was often influenced by the slant that may or may not have been put on statements issued by members of the forum or by the forum itself.</P>
      <P>This House and the people of Ireland owe a debt of gratitude to the many civil servants and politicians from all sides who have contributed to this. I recall impasses and crises of one kind or another where words were the stumbling block. Often it took overnight discussions by civil servants to produce a formula of words to allow the process to move forward.</P>
      <P>In this regard 1998 will prove to be one of the most important years in terms of constitutional politics in this country, both North and South. The repeal of most of the British Acts of Parliament relevant to Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, and the changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, which, if this side of the House had been in Government, would not have been effected for political reasons, are the most significant changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> In addition, the changes and moves made by each of the past number of Taoisigh enabled them to fill in pieces of the jigsaw which others may not have been able to do. They can all claim that their thumbprint is on the fabric of the Agreement and this Bill. Throughout, one would not have thought the fear, bloodshed and terror that existed in Northern Ireland for 30 years would have resulted in ceasefires by the paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic, because matters have now been reduced to the one remaining stumbling block of decommissioning. When I listen to Deputy Ó Caoláin and hear statements by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness to the effect that they are genuinely sincere &ndash; I believe them when they speak about proceeding on the road of peace &ndash; and contrast that with subsequent statements by the IRA army council that decommissioning will never occur I am concerned, especially when it is understood that the army council takes precedence over the political wing. There will always be a doubt as to how the crisis will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>When one speaks to republican elements and to those who have a knowledge about what happened in Northern Ireland it becomes clear that there will not be decommissioning of certain kinds of arms which were used by the Provisional IRA for the purposes of war tactics. These have, in an unfortunate sense, become heirlooms. However, there is no tradition or sacredness about having tons of semtex locked away. There should be decommissioning of semtex because its only use is to blow lives away. If we are serious about the development of our country and our people, about what John Hume often calls accommodating the differences among our peoples, we should ensure that this gesture is made.</P>
    <P>I will refer on Committee Stage to the bodies dealing with the inland waterways and the Irish language. There are matters of importance that need to be teased out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker said people have a mindset against decommissioning. It is tiresome listening to radio interviews with people such as Mitchell McLaughlin and Martin McGuinness who keep stating that decommissioning is not part of the Agreement. They are correct but the Agreement states that all decommissioning must be done within two years. As we approach the first anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, it is understandable that there is extreme disappointment that neither semtex or guns have been handed over. The Agreement also states that an independent commission will monitor, review and verify progress on the decommissioning of illegal arms and will report to both Governments at regular intervals. However, that has not happened in the past year as there has not been decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill outlines the procedure for establishing bodies. I am particularly interested in aquaculture and marine matters. The Commissioners of Irish <Col N="1332" /> Lights, which are based in Dublin, are responsible for the coastline in the North and South. The 15 representatives on the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who will probably lose their positions when the new board is established, have given great service. I hope they are paid compensation under this legislation.  </P>
    <P>Legislation must be passed before these changes are implemented by the end of the year. Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough are natural contiguous communities in the North and South and it is only right that they pool their resources in terms of aquaculture development and tourism. I am sure when chief executives are appointed to those bodies, it will be in their interest to advance the causes of those communities by tapping into their financial resources. This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of appreciation of the role played by the Commissioners of Irish Lights over the years. They were established in 1781 and the last Act which had a direct impact on them was the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. They have operated effectively with a staff of approximately 260 and 80 attendants who are mainly involved in lighthouse duties.</P>

      <P>It is a privilege to contribute to this historic debate. There may be an air of normality in the House this evening but that does not mask the fact we are marking a historic achievement, the passing of the British-Irish Agreement Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the most reassuring things in recent times is that historic events have been treated as almost normal events. When the British Prime Minister addressed both Houses of the Oireachtas, the atmosphere seemed to suggest that major historic event was being taken for granted. We should remember that not only those currently involved in building up this major and important edifice of peace but also those who went before them have played a major part in reaching this significant stage.</P>
      <P>This is an agreement between both Governments, between North and South and within the North. As one who has been involved in this process for some time, I feel a sense of envy that I am not involved at its culmination but also a sense of pride and admiration for those who are. Some elements were part of a party policy which I introduced as long ago as 1975. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to see it being put into place this evening in an atmosphere of almost normality if not routine practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That both Governments have been working <i>ad idem</i> for some time is a tribute to the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach. It is also a tribute to the Ministers who have been working hard to bring about this enlightenment and confidence. <Col N="1333" /> As co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I, on behalf of the representatives of the elected representatives of our people, whether in this Parliament or the British Parliament, confirm that we will play our part in ensuring that what the representatives of Government have put together, we will spontaneously support. I anticipate that when this body meets at the end of this month in Dromoland Castle, which has significant historical connotations for Anglo-Irish relations, we will spontaneously and warmly endorse what our Governments have been doing in our name.</P>
    <P>The areas mentioned in the Bill are the avenues to further common cause and progress. While agriculture and tourism are not immediately included for action, they are included for further serious consideration and development. As Minister for Agriculture for five years, I know that agriculture is the area in which the common interest of the Northern Ireland and the Southern Ireland producers is self-evident. During long night's negotiations in Brussels as Minister for Agriculture, the Ulster Farmers Union always felt closer to our negotiating position than it did to that of the British Minister for Agriculture who represented a consumer society. Surely there can be no threat in advancing the common interest of agriculture any more than there can be in advancing the common interest of tourism? These are matters of natural coincidental interest not just at home but in our multilateral trade negotiations with Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since I was privileged to be Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1977 when we engaged in bilateral negotiations from time to time. I recall attending with Jack Lynch, a Taoiseach who was greatly respected both at home and in Britain, meetings with Jim Callaghan, the then British Prime Minister, and subsequently with Mrs. Margaret Thatcher. I pay tribute to all those people who have built on that base over the years, including Taoisigh from all sides, who built up an understanding which Governments and Ministers of the day have so efficiently and effectively put in place.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Ministers from the other Government with which I was privileged to deal from time to time who laid the foundations for what we are now achieving. I am thinking of people such as Lord Peter Carrington, Mr. Geoffrey Howe and Mr. Humphrey Atkins, who were involved in the Dublin Castle Summit in 1979. While there have been stops, hesitations, obstacles and falls since then, the contribution of such people cannot be underestimated much less taken for granted.</P>
    <P>I want to mention another area where there is common cause. It is said that communication does not pose a threat to anybody. If I were asked to nominate one area which broke down the barrier between east and west, between totalitarian and democratic states, before the Berlin Wall finally came down, it was communications. Young people inside the Iron Curtain were able <Col N="1334" /> to observe young people living outside the Iron Curtain. They saw them at play and in a sense they shared that recreation with them. Those young people did more to break down that awful wall, not just the physical but the metaphorical wall, than any Governments at that time.</P>
    <P>I hope we will shortly see the total and free transmission of our television programmes North and South, whether it is UTV, RTE or the BBC. I realise some commercial arrangements will have to be made with the directors of these interests but it is time that this is done. We have nothing to fear from communicating with each other and transmitting to each other programmes about the routine of our daily lives, our culture, hopes and confidence.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Ministers of both Governments who played a dynamic role in this process, to not only the Taoiseach and Mr. Blair but also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and Mo Mowlam, who, despite ill health, has made a major contribution. It is appropriate that both these people had the opportunity of sealing all those relations. I also mention the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who is in the House this evening, and her counterpart Paul Murphy, who have demonstrated that it pays to have people of commitment and imagination on the ground, with their respective Ministers, to steer this process in terms of tolerance, understanding and confidence.</P>
    <P>I will conclude shortly because I want to share my time with my two colleagues. I want to record my appreciation of the work of some of the most enlightened officials any Government would be privileged to have in the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have worked with both Departments and, while these officials do not like to be mentioned, it is significant that one of those with whom I worked closely more than 20 years ago &ndash; he was in the Taoiseach's Department &ndash; is in the House this evening. I will refrain from naming him but it is a measure of that constant commitment that these officials, with their knowledge and sensitivity, helped to steer us all to this position where, as the Minister said today, we have a transformation from conflict and division to peace and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I particularly acknowledge the courage of the leaders of the Northern Ireland parties. Despite the issues with which they are struggling at this time, the leaders of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness struggled for years to get to the point we have now reached &ndash; I know this from my own experience &ndash; and their efforts, in addition to those of people like David Trimble, Ken Maginnis and Dermot Nesbitt, deserve the success we will hopefully celebrate. The Irish phrase &ldquo;go mbeidh toradh saothair le gach éinne&rdquo;, let everyone have the rewards of their efforts, is appropriate. I believe there will be great rewards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important <Col N="1335" /> debate. I concur with Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks in paying tribute to officials in both the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Over the years I had to contact officials, particularly in the Department of Foreign Affairs, regarding difficulties experienced by my constituents going about their daily business due to road blocks, etc. and I was always given the utmost help by officials in the Department who displayed their knowledge of the situation on the ground, particularly in the Border region.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on their presentation of the legislation today. It is historic and a major milestone in the furtherance of the Good Friday Agreement. In recent years we have been privileged to witness historic dates in Anglo-Irish and North-South relations &ndash; the Downing Street Declaration in 1993, the Good Friday Agreement last April, referendum day North and South on 22 May last and, yesterday, the signing of four international agreements. The legislation before the House provides for participation in the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, and also provides for the establishment of the implementation bodies.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to everybody on this island and further afield that the Good Friday Agreement is the basis for lasting peace in this country. The Agreement won the widespread and enthusiastic endorsement of the people of this island last May. The whole island must benefit from the potential of this Agreement.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Tánaiste say this evening that the working procedures of these new implementation bodies will begin the process of ensuring the economic prosperity of the Border regions which have suffered most as a result of the troubles. The six southern Border counties and the six northern Border counties suffered immeasurably, both socially and economically, over a period of 30 years. It is important that the economic regeneration needed south of the Border is given all the necessary impetus.</P>
      <P>In the agreement of 18 December last, six matters appropriate to further co-operation were identified: transport, agriculture, education, health, environment and tourism. These are areas of common concern and the North-South bodies will bring increased trade and generate employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These bodies will not only bring practical, economic and social benefits but they will offer an institutional expression of the Irish identity of Northern Nationalists. I wish to refer in particular to the waterways body. I am glad responsibility for the Shannon-Erne waterway will transfer to the new body. It was due to the political leadership, particularly of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, that the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal was restored and that we now have the Shannon-Erne waterway, which has been a major catalyst for <Col N="1336" /> tourism development in the south Fermanagh, west Cavan and south Leitrim areas. Much more work needs to be done on inland waterways. I appeal to the officials working on the new bodies to ensure that the Erne navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killeshandra and Lough Gowna is completed so that the optimum use can be made of that waterway.</P>
    <P>I hope both Governments will decide to locate the headquarters of these new bodies in Ulster, and I can think of no better place than the central Border area of Cavan. I hope that the need to decentralise and regenerate the Border economy can be helped by decisions to locate administrative units in those areas.</P>

      <P>It is important in the discussions that will take place tonight and tomorrow to be supportive, optimistic and forward looking. As an Ulster woman who represents a Border county, I see economic and cultural opportunities for the development of a region which has, unfortunately, not developed to the same extent as the rest of this country. That region includes the west of Northern Ireland as well as the six Border counties in the Republic.</P>
      <P>The areas identified in the implementation bodies are ones in which there can be tremendous co-operation. I hope we will see the fruits of working together in economic development through trade and business and in the aquaculture and marine sector, which is extremely important in my constituency. EU programmes are vital for the development of the Border region. I urge the Minister of State to ensure the programmes funded by the Commission include additionality as opposed to substitution for national investment by both the Irish and British Governments, which has been discussed in recent years. There must be additionality to develop the region fully and to ensure the economic progress the Border counties deserve.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the waterways body. There has been a transfer of functions from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands regarding the development and restoration of inland navigable waterway systems with special reference to the Ulster Canal and the linkage which is proposed on the Erne system. I am sure the staff of the Department studied geography, but it is worth reminding them that the Erne flows into Donegal Bay and does not stop at Enniskillen. It should be included in any developments on the Erne-Shannon waterway system and the Ulster Canal system. Beleek and Cloghore have invested heavily and need tourism development. Linkage to Ballyshannon, which is not beyond the abilities of our engineers, should be included. The Border counties look forward to the implementation bodies reaching their potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> I wish to respond to a remark by Deputy Ó Caoláin. There is pain and gain in the Good Friday Agreement. It is the people, North and South, who are anxious to see political progress. No impasse regarding decommissioning is beyond resolution. I urge everybody involved, regardless of their political background, to ensure the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement is realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to overcome the effects of divergence in the growth of the economies on either side of the Border through enhanced co-operation. To fully realise the potential of Ireland as a single market, many issues must be dealt with. These include the negative economic impact on both sides of the Border of the recent troubles both within and outside the island, the lack of an all-island strategic approach to many shared economic and social issues and the limited co-operation at all levels of society from local community, private and public sector organisations through to Government.</P>
      <P>In recent years much strenuous work has gone into addressing these issues. Many programmes such as the IFI, the special support programme for peace and reconciliation and INTERREG have done excellent work in addressing specific problems at grassroots level. The endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement provides a singular and important opportunity to further develop co-operation on economic activity on the island by providing for new cross-Border co-operation through existing or agreed implementation bodies, as set out in Strand 2 of the Agreement. It is hoped the Agreement will address the many opportunities to improve cross-Border trade links, develop economies of scale and enhance business. The EU, in concert with the two Governments, will have a key role in shaping the future of the economic development of both regions on the island.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on the Bill on this historic day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity on behalf of the Government to conclude Second Stage of the British-Irish Agreement Bill. I thank all Deputies for their positive and supportive approach to the Bill and to the agreements signed at Dublin Castle yesterday, to which the Bill gives effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies acknowledged the significance of the Bill. As Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, there is an eerie normality about debating so quickly issues of such historical significance and significance for the future of the two islands. I regret that Deputies had so little time to study the detailed provisions either of the agreement setting up the implementation bodies or of the Bill. The final text of the agreement was not agreed until lunchtime on Sunday so the Bill could not be completed earlier. The equivalent British order was laid before the House of Com<Col N="1338" /> mons yesterday and debated last night. We considered it important to advance matters in the same broad timeframe.</P>
    <P>As was made clear by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, once arrangements to implement these elements of the Good Friday Agreement have been put in place, the technical preparations necessary to enable it to enter into force will have been completed. It is important, therefore, that there be no undue delay on our side. We are most grateful to the Opposition parties for their constructive and accommodating approach.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to consider matters which Deputies may wish to raise about individual sections of the Bill. However, I wish to respond briefly to the concerns raised by Deputy Quinn about section 5 which confers certain powers on the Taoiseach to remedy difficulties in bringing the Act or the agreement into operation. I understand, on the basis of preliminary advice, that this section is intended to relate only to matters of a minor, technical character and that the terms of the Constitution would not permit its use for any wider purpose. Any changes in the agreement would have to be agreed between the two sides and confirmed by an exchange of letters between the Governments, as is provided for. However, this matter can be dealt with more fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that about 20 months will have elapsed between the referenda in Scotland and Wales and the establishment of devolved administrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff. In about half that time, the progress made in implementing the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; a more complex and multi-faceted document &ndash; has been remarkable and gives the lie to those who assert that no real advances have occurred in that time. It is also important to remember that progress has been made across the board, not just in relation to institutional matters. The creation of the new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, for example, and the advanced state of legislative preparations for a similar commission in this jurisdiction &ndash; we hope to be in a position to introduce this legislation shortly &ndash; are developments of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>The text of the Agreement on implementation bodies, and so of the Bill, is detailed. There is, admittedly, a certain absence of poetry or of rhetoric. However, the history of relations between Nationalist and Unionist, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland has been marked by a good deal of poetry and rhetoric. On the other hand there have been few opportunities in that history to use the more sober prose of effective public administration. Viewed in that perspective, the fact that we must make provision for complex arrangements, worked out in careful detail, is a cause for celebration.</P>
    <P>The bodies being set up by the Agreement and being empowered by the Bill are unprecedented. As David Trimble said in the House of Commons <Col N="1339" /> last night, &ldquo;something rather unique&rdquo; is being achieved. It is true that there has been worthwhile North-South co-operation for many years and that its volume and intensity have increased in recent years. It is also true that both the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Commissioners of Irish Lights have, in their different ways, worked on a cross-Border or all-island basis. What is new is that we are putting in place a new structure and system for carrying forward co-operation and common action.</P>
    <P>In the lead up to Good Friday, the negotiations on North-South issues in strand two were intensively difficult. More time was spent on issues of North-South co-operation than on anything else. Even during Holy Week, it looked as if the negotiations might break down on precisely this point. It was clear to all sides that not only were there important practical issues to be addressed, but that matters of huge symbolic political importance were involved. Meaningful and worthwhile North-South institutions are for Nationalists an integral part of the overall balance of the Agreement, a counterweight to the Assembly and to constitutional change, and they must be worked vigorously and taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>The institutional aspects of the Agreement have been somewhat overlooked since last year, such has been the preoccupation with other issues. They are of immense long-term significance in providing the framework for a new beginning in all our relationships through which we can transcend the troubled history of these islands. In the longer perspective of history, the achievement of these bodies and of a North-South Ministerial Council and a British-Irish Council should not be discounted, minimised or taken lightly.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed by the contribution of a Northern Nationalist, Deputy Currie. He articulated, with great sincerity, how important the North-South aspect to the historic compromise is to Northern Nationalists who for so long felt abandoned and neglected in terms of their allegiance.</P>
    <P>It is unprecedented for this House to have so many Ministers dealing with and speaking on one Bill. The extent and breadth of ministerial involvement reflects the range of Government functions and activities which are affected by this Bill. It also reflects the extraordinary dedication and commitment shown by Ministers and their officials in the negotiation of the implementation bodies agreement. In this jurisdiction sometimes we are accused of being partitionist, an issue to which Deputy Currie referred, and of being long on talk and short on action when it comes to North-South co-operation. If that charge were ever true, the energy, creativity and enthusiasm shown right across our public service, including all the Departments in their approach to these difficult negotiations, demonstrably proves that this is no longer the case. What Deputy Deenihan said is true, to reach the historical compromise, <Col N="1340" /> all the parties in Northern Ireland and the two Governments had to move from cherished positions.</P>
    <P>The six implementation bodies represent an important and diverse range of public service activity. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other Ministers who have addressed the House have spoken in some detail on the role and significance of each of the bodies. As the Taoiseach said, once the bodies are up and running, some £56 million in annual expenditure will be involved and the bodies will have a total staff of about 880.</P>
    <P>Each of the bodies will have its distinct mission and organisation. In the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, each will have &ldquo;a clear operational remit&rdquo;. It is our intention that from day to day each will operate with the practical autonomy which characterises our own semi-State bodies. They will operate within a common framework and on the basis of certain key principles. I hope this will address the concerns of Deputy Flanagan about their accountability.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Agreement specifies that each body will &ldquo;implement any decisions of the North-South Ministerial Council on policies and actions relating to matters within the scope of its functions.&rdquo;  Moreover, in exercising its functions, a body will at all times act in accordance with any directions, whether of a general or specific nature, given by the North-South Ministerial Council. This ensures that the bodies will be subject to political direction, but on an agreed North-South basis. The bodies will also have to submit corporate plans to the council for its approval and to furnish an annual report on their activities.</P>
    <P>The chain of accountability will run through the council to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly, but there is also a requirement that any member of a body or its staff, if so requested, will appear before or otherwise co-operate with the Northern Ireland Assembly or an Oireachtas committee or sub-committee, in accordance with normal practice and relevant legislation within each jurisdiction. On the points raised by Deputies Quinn and Mitchell, this will include the Committee of Public Accounts to which reports on the bodies that will be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton raised the important point of judicial review of the actions of the bodies. As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, consultation arrangements between the two Attorneys General have been agreed to address any issues which might arise. We are confident that the approach taken, of inserting most of the detail into the common text of the Agreement between the two Governments, should minimise any difficulties.</P>
    <P>In the long run we see the North-South Ministerial Council as the principal focus of North-South co-operation. Work is proceeding on the detailed procedural arrangements for the council, which we are determined to ensure will be a <Col N="1341" /> vibrant and active institution, with a dedicated secretariat, and which will address the entire gamut of areas of common interest and mutual advantage. The council will meet at least twice a year in plenary format and regularly and frequently in each sectoral format.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are also being made in respect of the British-Irish Council, which has an important and complementary role, though arrangements in respect of its secretariat have not yet been finalised. Deputy Flanagan raised concern about paragraph 10 of strand three. The aim is to strike a balance between the flexibility necessary to allow certain members to pursue issues of special interest to them and the need to maintain the overall identity of the council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also raised the absence of reference in the Bill to the North-South and British-Irish interparliamentary tiers envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. The Government very much supports the development of these arrangements, which would build on the excellent work of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, but this is a matter for Deputies and Senators to pursue with their colleagues elsewhere, perhaps after power has been devolved to the Assembly and to Scotland and Wales as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is our hope and determination that soon it will be possible for devolution to the Assembly and to an inclusive Northern Ireland executive to take place. As several speakers emphasised, this urgently requires a resolution of the decommissioning issue. To falter at this stage, after so many hurdles have been overcome and with the winning post in sight, would be unthinkable and unforgivable. Dialogue must continue. It will be intensified over coming weeks so that the bright promise contained in the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people North and South and given operational form in this legislation, can be realised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen raised the issue of North-South co-operation on tourism. That was not one of the areas agreed for implementation bodies on 18 December last. However, it was one of the six broad areas for co-operation, other than the implementation bodies agreed. It was agreed, in particular, that a tourism company would be set up by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to take responsibility for the international marketing of the island of Ireland as tourist destination. Such a company is to be established under company law and, accordingly, is not to be established under statute, as are the implementation bodies dealt with in the Bill. Since 18 December the Departments responsible for tourism, North and South, have worked intensively and agreed a detailed paper on the operation of the company. It remains to obtain political sign-off to what has been agreed at political level. There is full acceptance that the arrangements for the tourism company must be fully in place at the time the British-Irish Agreement comes into effect, subject to agreement by the North-South Ministerial Council. At the recent <Col N="1342" /> meeting between the Taoiseach and the First Minister designate there was agreement on further early steps to bring the preparation of the tourism marketing company to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of the trade body and whether groups, North and South, would be able to work with that body and develop economic co-operation. The remit of the body is broad. The first function listed in the Agreement regarding the body is to develop co-operation on business development opportunities, North and South. I envisage a very intensive interaction between the body and organisations and groups seeking to develop better economic and business ties between the two parts of the island.</P>
    <P>I felt privileged to represent the Government on the team together with the Minister, Deputy Andrews, the Taoiseach and other Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who from time to time participated in the negotiations. I join with other Deputies on all sides of the House and Ministers who have given full credit to the excellent expert work of officials on all sides and in all Departments who contributed, with great patriotism and determination, to bringing these matters to a conclusion and without whom we could not have progressed this far.</P>

      <P>There is a need to provide a rehabilitation assessment unit to meet the needs of the elderly population of Laois-Offaly at St. Vincent's hospital in Mountmellick.</P>
      <P>St. Vincent's hospital serves a population base of 28,796 &ndash; 14,614 males and 14,162 females. There are 3,266 people over 65 years of age, 725 of whom are single and 1,123 people who are widowed. This population mainly uses the general hospitals at Tullamore and Portlaoise for acute care needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on a recent survey of admissions to the general hospitals at Portlaoise and Tullamore, the following admissions were made from the Mountmellick catchment area over a 20 day period in January 1999: 11 persons per week, one from St. Vincent's hospital in Mountmellick, were admitted to Portlaoise and five per week, again with one person from St. Vincent's, were admitted to Tullamore. The most important statistic is that 50 per cent of the admissions were of people who were over 65 years of age. Of those admitted, on average one person per week was admitted from St. Vincent's hospital, Mountmellick to both Portlaoise and Tullamore general hospitals, <Col N="1343" /> mainly patients who due to their physical condition or lack of family support remain in the acute hospitals to rehabilitate before discharge, occupying beds needed by acutely ill patients.</P>
    <P>On many occasions patients had to be discharged early to free up beds when they may have benefited from additional rehabilitation to return more rapidly to normal living. Those admitted from St. Vincent's hospital Mountmellick eventually returned to this care centre for older people following rehabilitation and discharge.</P>
    <P>A rehabilitation assessment unit for Laois-Offaly would relieve the pressure on the acute beds in the general hospitals in Tullamore and Portlaoise. It would also help to relieve the demand for beds for the elderly in hospitals for the elderly at Mountmellick and Abbeyleix.</P>
    <P>A rehabilitation assessment unit for Laois-Offaly in Mountmellick is required to meet the needs of the elderly population. It would provide for proper assessment of the patients' needs to live independently after acute illness and post surgery. Post hip operation patients, for example, require intensive physiotherapy and occupational surgery and nursing rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>St. Vincent's hospital in Mountmellick has built a reputation for itself over the years as an excellent centre for care of the elderly people in the Laois-Offaly area. The hospital currently has 171 beds, including ten independent living units. The average age of patients there is 81 years. The hospital is ideally suited for the location of a rehabilitation assessment unit. As well as an excellent professional staff, the hospital has an active social and patient support group.</P>
    <P>A rehabilitation assessment unit is now urgently required to meet the needs of the elderly population to assure them about their quality of life and to add life to years as well as years to life. I urge the Minister to respond positively and grant the necessary funding for such a unit for the Laois-Offaly area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the question of the need to provide a rehabilitation unit at St. Vincent's hospital, Mountmellick, for the elderly population of Laois-Offaly.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board has adopted a strategy for the health and social gain of older people. In relation to care in centres for older people, it is envisaged that there will be a significant rehabilitation input. Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, chiropody, visual testing, audiology, incontinence advice, nutrition advice etc. will be provided to enable the rehabilitation of patients where possible and to improve the quality of life where rehabilitation is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inappropriate admissions to care centres have, in the past, led to older people being in long-term care when alternative forms of care would have <Col N="1344" /> given a better quality of life. Assessment is critical to ensure that the older people are provided with care that best matches their needs.</P>
    <P>In the case of St. Vincent's hospital, Mountmellick, the strategy of the Midland Health Board advocates that a 20 bed rehabilitation and assessment unit be provided. The importance of rehabilitation for older people is recognised and a successful unit impacts positively on the availability of beds in acute general hospitals.</P>
    <P>In providing such a unit at Mountmellick, it will be necessary to provide the appropriate infrastructure in capital terms and there will also be increased costs in terms of the improved staffing levels and a wider range of staff and skills expertise-revenue costs.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board, subject to funds being made available, wishes to make progress in such a unit in the future. I agree in principle with the Midland Health Board on this matter and the proposal will be considered in the light of the priorities of the health board and the availability of capital resources.</P>
    <P>I have already committed considerable capital resources to projects relating to older people within the Midland Health Board area since I came to office. I must have regard to the needs of all health boards but I will treat the Mountmellick proposal as sympathetically as possible within the constraints I have just described.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue funding of £1.145 million was provided to the Midland Health Board this year for the development of services for older people. Included in this was a specific sum of £100,000 to provide increased staffing levels at St. Vincent's hospital, Mountmellick. The additional funding for services for older people will mean that many more older people will have access to the community supports necessary to allow them to live in their own homes, amongst their neighbours, with the dignity and respect which they deserve in their older age.</P>
    <P>I commend the Deputy for bringing this matter to my attention and assure him that I will do all I can to progress the issue.</P>

      <P>There is grave disquiet and anxiety in the Mullingar area, and throughout counties Longford and Westmeath, concerning the future of Mullingar General Hospital. The recent announcement of the Minister of £50 million capital investment programme for Tullamore General Hospital is seen not only as political expediency but as a total rejection of the decisions of the Midland Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minutes of the September 1997 meeting of the Midland Health Board state that the order of priorities, as previously agreed by members, were agreed once again. They are: the commissioning of phase 2A of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital; capital project, General Hospital, Tullamore &ndash; accident and emergency department, out patients department, day ward, new entrance and <Col N="1345" /> concourse; capital project, general hospital, Portlaoise &ndash; acute psychiatric unit, medical wards, catering department, and provision was made for the design to add a new paediatric unit to the general hospital at Portlaoise; and, phase 2B, Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the members would seek funding from the Minister for all the board's priorities but that the list would reflect the order of priority if that was requested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement for Tullamore goes contrary to those minutes. The rejection of Mullingar General Hospital is particularly disturbing when we see a five storey block built at this hospital three years ago with four floors still unoccupied. The fitting out of these floors would provide much needed beds. Is the Minister aware that, even though there are 57 medical beds in this hospital, the bed occupancy over the winter averaged in the region of 90 beds per day? It peaked at 120 beds per day.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that Mullingar General Hospital has the highest output and best value for taxpayers money of all the hospitals in the Midland Health Board area? The Minister, by failing to sanction the additional capital funding for phase 2B of Mullingar General Hospital, is penalising the staff of the hospital and the people of Longford and Westmeath who rely on the hospital for services.</P>
    <P>A new consultant surgeon is to take up his appointment shortly. Will there be adequate theatre facilities to ensure the maximum output from this new surgeon and all the other surgeons working at the hospital? </P>
    <P>Contrast all this with the announcement of capital investment of £73 million for the Minister's own constituency of Laois-Offaly. The corresponding announcements for Longford and Westmeath amount to £2 million. That money is the proceeds of the sale of lands and buildings at St. Loman's in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I demand that the Minister set out the timetable for the completion of phase 2B of Mullingar General Hospital. The public of Longford and Westmeath are not prepared to wait for the provision of these much needed additional beds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly regret the tone of the Deputy's contribution. It beggars belief that a Deputy from that side of the House could make such a contribution. The question of setting priorities for the development of acute hospital services in the Midland Health Board area is a matter for the board in the first instance. Some years ago, the Midland Health Board determined its priorities, as part of a comprehensive acute hospital plan, as the completion of phase 2A of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, the development of Tullamore General Hospital, the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at Portlaoise General Hospital and the completion and commissioning of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what Deputy McGrath said, I am very pleased with the progress made on these priori<Col N="1346" /> ties to date, priorities which are being achieved because someone is taking cognisance of the needs of the Midland Health Board area, unlike the Deputy's colleague when he was in office.</P>

      <P>There was no money for it. I provided half the total commissioning unit costs in 1998 for Mullingar General Hospital, 50 per cent of the national requirement. I was happy to perform the official opening of this important development last November. On 19 February 1999 I announced a much needed major capital development at Tullamore General Hospital. I had earlier given approval to proceed with the detailed planning of an acute psychiatric unit at Portlaoise General Hospital and was pleased to be able to approve a proposal to combine this with a new paediatric unit at the hospital, which was not in the plans of any Fine Gael Minister for Health as far as I am aware, nor was any money provided for it.</P>

Those are the facts. I am glad I have been able to make considerable progress in relation to these vital developments at all three acute general hospitals in the Midland Health Board area. The developments I have approved illustrate my commitment to developing all three acute general hospitals in the midland region in an integrated, cohesive way, as set down by the Midland Health Board for the past 15 years.</P>

Members of the Opposition have come to the House crying about why there were such long orthopaedic lists &ndash; 2,500 &ndash; in Tullamore General Hospital, which provides a service for all four counties. I am sick and tired of answering questions from Opposition Deputies who cry crocodile tears. I am proposing a capital development to deal with that issue, which will help those in Deputy McGrath's constituency as much as it will help those in mine. Perhaps I should have done nothing, the same as the Minister from the Deputy's party, for the people of Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath&mdash;</P>

Developments at Tullamore General Hospital which has responsibility for providing orthopaedics and ENT to the whole area are important as it is not only those living in Offaly who will benefit, as some people, including Deputy McGrath, would like to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to improving the services of all three hospitals in the entire region and I have set about doing this in a planned, co-ordinated way. I have already provided the necessary funding for the opening of phase 2A in Mullingar. I was the <Col N="1348" /> first to provide funding for major improvements at Portlaoise General Hospital, the first improvements in 60 years, and recently I continued the improvement process by announcing a major development at Tullamore. I understand that the next priority of the board is to complete and commission phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. The availability of funding for phase 2B will be examined in the light of competing priorities in the health capital programme, but it is not possible at this stage, as the Deputy knows, to give commitments in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been over two years since the four District Courts at Dunfanaghy, Falcarragh, Bunbeg and Dungloe were abolished. Since then, District Court business for these areas has been carried out in Letterkenny and Glenties, to the great inconvenience of both practitioners and litigants alike. There is now only one District Court in the western seaboard of County Donegal, in Glenties. Legal services in this area are effectively marginalised. A population of some 15,000 people have to travel between 30 and 40 miles to avail of the services of a District Court.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State and before, there has always been a District Court in Bunbeg, the heart of the Donegal gaeltacht. The decision in January 1997 to abolish the court at Bunbeg means that residents of Gweedore, with District Court business, are obliged to travel to Glenties, which is a distance in excess of 30 miles over one of the most difficult roads in the county. Public transport between Gweedore and Glenties is almost non-existent. This makes it inconvenient and more expensive for people to travel. As a result, legal costs have risen, as more time is spent travelling to various courts at which cases are heard.</P>
      <P>The same is true of Dungloe and Rosses. The long established District Court in Dungloe was closed in January 1997 and never reopened. The people of these areas have to travel and are subject to the same inconvenience and expense. The situation in Falcarragh and Dunfanaghy is just as critical. Both these courts were closed in January 1997 and people now have to travel to Letterkenny which is over 30 miles from Falcarragh and 23 miles from Dunfanaghy. At least one of these courts should be immediately reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the matter in a national context, how would litigants in Dublin accept having to travel to Dundalk, Kildare or Navan to appear at District Court or how would people in these areas accept having to travel to Dublin? The Minister, <Col N="1349" /> in addition to representing a rural constituency, is a legal practitioner of wide experience. Would it be acceptable in Kerry for people to travel to Limerick, or from Tralee to Killarney, for a District Court hearing?</P>
    <P>The District Court situation in west Donegal would not be tolerated or accepted in any other part of the country, particularly on the east coast. A whole region has been marginalised as far as access to the District Courts is concerned. After two years, I ask the Minister to restore these essential court services in west Donegal, in Bunbeg, Falcarragh, Dungloe and Dunfanaghy. A long tradition has been broken and I ask the Minister to have these facilities re-established as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Is mór an náire é, cé go bhfuil ceann de na Gaeltachtaí is mó sa tír i dTír Chonaill, nach bhfuil cúirt cheantair nó dúiche suite ann faoi láthair. Ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh an tAire aire speisialta do sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of the ongoing difficulties arising from the absence of District Court sittings at Dunfanaghy, Falcarragh, Bunbeg and Dungloe. As Deputies will be aware, the need to rearrange certain District Court areas arose following queries raised in the District Court in Milford, County Donegal by a solicitor concerning planning requirements for the use of rented accommodation for sittings of the District Court and the decision of the District Court judge that Court sittings could not be held in such places without specific planning approval.</P>
      <P>As a precautionary measure my Department arranged for the transfer of all sittings in rented accommodation in Donegal to the nearest dedicated courthouse. At the time the Donegal County Council submitted the issue of whether planning permission was required in respect of the use of the function room in the Milford Hotel to An Bord Pleanála for a ruling. An Bord Pleanála ruled that planning permission was not required as use of the function room was exempted development under planning legislation.</P>
      <P>Last year I met a deputation from Donegal which was anxious to have reinstated the courts which were closed in County Donegal. I undertook at the time to reopen the court venues as quickly as possible. Ballyshannon Court has been reinstated following consultation with the District Court judge. My officials have been in ongoing contact with Donegal County Council and the District Court judge with a view to acquiring suitable court accommodation in the areas which were closed pending the necessary reinstatement of the District Court areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 February this year officials from the Department met Donegal County Council and the District Court judge. I understand from that meeting that attention was given to progressing the reopening of District Court venues in west Donegal. Nevertheless, there are difficulties in <Col N="1350" /> finding suitable premises in some localities which meet even minimal standards appropriate for a court venue.</P>
    <P>However, I recognise the hardship on the public in having to travel longer distances to court and have asked my officials in conjunction with the District Court judge and Donegal County Council to expedite the reopening of as many as possible of the venues which were closed.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department again met with the District Court judge last Friday and I hope some of the court venues in west Donegal can be re-opened as a result. I am also conscious that a number of cases would be heard in Irish in Bunbeg and am anxious to have this District Court area reinstated for this reason. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta; tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh Cúirt Dúiche san nGaeltacht Tír Chonaill, agus táim ag déanamh mo dhícheall chun an chúirt san a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the venues which were closed were rented by Donegal County Council. The courts sit in these venues approximately one day per month. The facilities provided in these venues do not always equate with the requirements of a court, particularly in the area of hearing family law business, which is a sensitive matter. These premises are privately owned and my Department cannot allocate funding to improve facilities in these venues, for obvious reasons. In any event, the funding available to my Department is directed towards the refurbishment of dedicated Courthouses throughout the country. I am sure the Deputy will agree that a significant amount of work has been done to upgrade court accommodation throughout the country in recent years. I have provided £8.5 million this year in capital funding for the courts building programme and a further £6.5 million for maintenance and upkeep of court buildings. This is the highest figure provided to date for the refurbishment of court accommodation. It is hoped to commence work shortly on the refurbishment of Buncrana Courthouse.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that I am anxious to reinstate the venues in County Donegal. However, I must take into account the views of the sitting judge and the need to provide accommodation appropriate to the functions of the courts. I expect that there will be some developments in respect of the venues referred to by the Deputy in the near future, and I will keep him informed of developments. With regard to whether people in Kerry would appreciate travelling from Killarney to Tralee or vice versa, the analogy I offer the Deputy is that whenever our senior football team wins in either venue, we are happy to travel.</P>

      <P>The Minister is probably familiar with a recent fine article and editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> concerning this matter. My interest arises out of the fact that Mr. William Geary <Col N="1351" /> comes from County Limerick and many of his relatives still live in the area. A member of his family approached me and asked me to raise this matter in whatever way possible. I am pleased that it has been allowed to be raised on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Next week many Ministers will be winging their way all over the world on St. Patrick's Day. Many of them will be going to the United States. A proud Irishman, Mr. William Geary, who is 100 years old, will also be celebrating St. Patrick's Day, but his celebration will be tinged with sorrow because of an incident that led to his enforced emigration to the US in November 1928, more than 70 years ago.</P>
      <P>On 25 June, 1928, Mr. Geary, a Garda Superintendent, was dismissed for allegedly accepting a bribe of £100 from the IRA. There was no trial, and Mr. Geary has vehemently denied the charge against him. For the past 70 years he has led a personal crusade to clear his good name. He has made numerous requests for a trial and has written to various Ministers for Justice over the years. Recently, the Taoiseach released some of the papers related to the case.</P>
      <P>I call for a thorough investigation of this case. Mr. Geary has taken lie detector tests and other examinations to prove his innocence. As far back as 1986 he signed a statement waiving all rights to back pay and compensation. If the State cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty, it is incumbent on the State to clear his name and restore his honour. Because of his age, speed is of the essence, and I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not allow St. Patrick's Day to pass without good tidings for Mr. Geary. I look forward to the Minister's reply with great interest.</P>

      <P>This issue relates to a former Superintendent of the Garda Síochána who was dismissed by the Government in power in 1928. I am constrained in what I can say by two considerations: the individual concerned is alive, and it would not be appropriate for me to discuss in public the full details of his affairs; also, I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of the consideration of the latest submissions made on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The basic facts have been made known by the individual to the media, so I see no harm in summarising those facts which are already in the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> In 1928, the individual concerned was accused of providing information to the IRA in return for bribes. He denied the allegations and has consistently protested his innocence since then. However, the Garda Síochána and Government of the day considered that the evidence against him was sufficient to justify his dismissal.</P>
    <P>Over the years, he has written to a number of Taoisigh and Ministers for Justice protesting his innocence. There have been a number of reviews of his case, but each came to the conclusion that there were no new facts that would justify overturning the original 1928 decision.</P>
    <P>The possibility that he was framed has to be considered. In the 1970s an in-depth investigation was carried out to establish if he had in fact been set up by the IRA. However, the inquiry was inconclusive because as far as could be established all the individuals who had been in the IRA at the time, and who would have been privy to that information, had since passed away.</P>
    <P>At the time the former Superintendent was dismissed, he was not given full access to the evidence against him. It appears there were security reasons for this approach. The source of, and the relevant documents which constituted the evidence against him were considered confidential and were not released.</P>
    <P>When I became aware that he was looking for relevant papers, I had the situation reviewed and arranged for my officials to send to him all the material relating to his dismissal in 1928, including copies of the confidential papers which constituted the evidence against him. The material was dispatched to the USA in early February of this year. As is standard practice in cases like this, the names of other individuals mentioned in the papers were blanked out to protect their privacy and that of any surviving family.</P>
    <P>This is the first time he has seen the full case against him. Shortly after this new information was released, two written submissions were made on his behalf. The latest of these arrived on 5 March 1999 and I am now considering them with a view to bringing a recommendation to Government for a decision.</P>

In addition, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Bord na Gaeilge &ndash; and the Irish language agency of the North-South language body, when established &ndash; will continue with their programmes in relation to the promotion of the Irish language both within and outside the Gaeltacht &ndash; and indeed on an all-Ireland basis.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 304 of 16 February 1999. The most common trees and shrubs found in hedgerows are hawthorn, blackthorn, ash, elm, gorse, willow, hazel and holly. These species are not specifically protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, but hedgerows receive protection under section 40 of the Act, which restricts the cutting, grubbing, burning and destruction of vegetation on uncultivated land during the critical nesting period of 15 April to 31 August. Similarly, regulations transposing the Habitats Directive into Irish law restrict damaging hedgerow destruction in special areas of conservation. While the loss of hedgerows and the valuable wildlife habitat which they provide is of concern, I believe that the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, will play an important part in contributing to the protection of hedgerow habitats.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also be aware that the issue of hedgerow conservation is receiving consideration by me in the context of the forthcoming amendment of the Wildlife Act and I expect to bring forward a number of amendments which will seek to strengthen the protective provisions applying to hedgerows. Furthermore, under the national biodiversity plan which I am preparing, some possible measures to improve the conservation of hedgerows have been identified and I intend to afford further consideration to those measures in the context of the finalisation of the plan.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that the issue raised in the question is of relevance to <Col N="1356" /> the National Library and I have not had any meeting with the Minister for Education and Science on this subject.</P>
      <P>National school registers do not have the status of departmental records for the purposes of the National Archives Act, 1986. Consequently there is in general no statutory requirement for them to be transferred to the National Archive. However, considerable quantities of school registers were transferred to the National Archives by the Department of Education in July 1993 and March 1994. In addition a smaller number of registers have been transferred to the National Archives by individual schools. In all registers of more than 400 national schools are now held in the National Archives and are available for public inspection there. However, the National Archives has advised the Department of Education and Science which has led to the carrying out of a survey by questionnaire of the records still held by national schools. The results of this survey should provide a sound basis for informing future policy concerning the preservation of the records.</P>
      <P>In the meantime while the National Archives would be glad to accept further transfers of registers from individual schools, in the longer term it may be more appropriate that school registers be transferred to local authority archives services now being established in many counties. While school registers are of national importance, they are primarily local records and should, if possible, be preserved by the appropriate local authority as part of their archives services.</P>

    <P>The matters referred to by the Deputies are identified as key priorities in relation to the arts in the programme for Government &ndash; An Action Programme for the Millennium. The report of the FORTE task force recommended that a music board should be established to promote and develop the indigenous music industry. I have indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions relating to these matters that these issues would best be considered within the frame<Col N="1357" /> work of such a board. I am pleased to advise that agreement has been reached with the music industry representatives under the auspices of IBEC to jointly fund a music board to further promote the industry. At the present time my Department is investigating the most suitable structure that would enable the board to be formally established on a non-statutory basis initially. Once the board is in place, I believe its terms of reference will enable the provision of such a forum for the consideration of issues such as the provision of music libraries and the potential of attracting performing artists to live in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in replies to previous questions on this matter a Bill is being drafted at present to provide for a statutory regime which will faciltate the early introduction in Ireland of digital broadcasting services, in particular digital terrestrial television. The draft text of the Bill is at a very advanced stage of preparation at present and has been the subject of consultation by my Department with RTE, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. I had hoped that it would have been possible to publish the Bill before the end of March. However, the matters to be addressed in the Bill are complex in that the Bill will be the first comprehensive piece of broadcasting legislation for ten years and must provide for broadcasting structures into the next century at a time when the parameters within which broadcasting <Col N="1358" /> has operated for over 70 years are undergoing fundamental change. Accordingly, finalising the details of the draft Bill with the Attorney General's office is a difficult and time consuming process. At this stage I believe that an April publication date is more likely.</P>

      <P>The Carrowmore Whitestrand proposed natural heritage area was surveyed to determine if these lands met the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC. This survey identified habitats covered by the directive in a relatively small portion of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultants for the developer subsequently prepared an environmental impact statement on lands proposed for the development. This process brought to light the existence of the rare species of snail Vertigo angustior. Dúchas, the heritage <Col N="1359" /> service of my Department, recently surveyed the area identified by the developers, and the special area of conservation, and discovered that the species is also to be found on land included in the special area of conservation.</P>
    <P>The grazing regime in use in recent years has led to nutrient enrichment of the soil, which is detrimental to the survival of the species, on the lands in question. It will be some time before the long-term impact of this nutrient enrichment is known and it is possible that the species will not survive irrespective of the management regime that may be put in place.</P>
    <P>The developers of the proposed golf course have contacted Dúchas and are committed to liaise with it, acquire its advice, and establish the course in a manner which is not detrimental to this snail. I am certain that the management regime that will be put in place will do all possible to satisfy the needs of the species. As these lands are included in a proposed natural heritage area, the developers will be required to meet their commitments regarding the snail or, if failing to do so, lose their development grants. Dúchas is confident that the golf course may be developed in such a way as to ensure it has no significant impact on Vertigo angustior. This species is known to be present in nine sites proposed for SAC designation. Dúchas carries out additional surveys to determine if the species is present in other sites.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 48 on 3 February 1999. I stated then that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is responsible for the care <Col N="1360" /> of many protected areas in the west, ranging from parks and gardens to national monuments. Although the overriding responsibility is that of conservation, the presentation of heritage sites to the public plays a key part in tourism. Each of these sites provides interpretation, some in purpose built buildings, others in existing buildings or monuments depending on the circumstances in each case.</P>
      <P>There were six heritage sites open to the public in 1980 in the western counties, from Donegal to Kerry, and they attracted 202,000 fee paying visitors in that year. By 1998 the number of such sites open to the public had risen to 23 with visitors to these sites amounting to some 763,000 &ndash; the comaparative figures for 1996 and 1997 were 760,000 and 757,000 respectively. Figures can fluctuate at individual sites depending on a variety of circumstances but overall there has been an upward trend in visitor numbers to the sites.</P>
      <P>In my previous reply I outlined the strategy to maintain and improve visitor numbers at sites and I am happy to say that there is close co-operation with Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department manages some 74 heritage sites, including some of the most prestigious national monuments and historic properties in the State. A full list of all sites which are open to the public this year is contained in my Department's booklet, Heritage Sites 1999, which is available free of charge to the general public and a copy of which I have arranged to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Among the historic properties currently open to the public are Emo Court, County Laois, and Muckross House, County Kerry. It is proposed to reopen Castletown, County Kildare, by the end of April, while Doneraile Court, County Cork, will be opened following the completion of necessary restoration and safety works.</P>
      <P>Lists of stately homes in private ownership which are opened for viewing by the public are not kept by my Department. However, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief for expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of that building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> A person who has obtained the two determinations is obliged before claiming relief, to provide Bord Fáilte with particulars of the name, if any, and address of the approved building, and the days and time during the year when access to the approved building is afforded to the public, such particulars being provided to the board on the understanding by the person and the board that they may be published by the board or by another body concerned with the promotion of tourism. The minimum obligation regarding access which must be satisfied is that access to an approved building is so afforded for not less than 60 days, including not less than 40 days during the period commencing on 1 May and ending on 30 September in any year.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have responsibility for stately homes in private ownership but is concerned with the preservation of important elements of our architectural heritage. Under the package of measurements announced in May grants will be available from local authorities for conservation works to listed buildings.

      <P>In regard to film and television projects certified by my Department under the section 481 scheme, 1998 was a record year for expenditure on film production in Ireland. There has been a trend for the average budgets of films certified by my Department under the scheme to increase as the capacity of the industry grows. Growth is related primarily to the development of the skills and physical infrastructure for film production, with the support of incentives and assistance provided by the State. Such skills and infrastructure have been building steadily and I am happy to say that present indications are that this process of growth will continue through 1999.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that I have been given the opportunity to represent the Government at the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Australia. These celebrations across the world provide the opportunity to give a high profile to <Col N="1363" /> Ireland which can be utilised to enhance economic and  cultural activity.</P>
      <P>While in Australia, I will meet Irish communities in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne and join with them in celebrating St. Patrick's Day. I hope to meet the Australian Prime Minister, my counterpart, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Premier of Victoria and the Lord Mayor of Sydney. I also hope to meet the chief executive of the Australian Film Commission, senior figures in the Australian broadcasting services, representatives of the Australia Council, the director of the Australian National Gallery, the president of the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce, the vice-chancellor of Victoria University and prominent members of the arts community in Australia.</P>
      <P>I am confident that my visit will promote further cultural links with Australia, a good example of which is the film co-production agreement in place between the two countries.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a provision of almost £200 million in my Department's group of Votes for 1999 to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, the cost of commitments made in relation to heritage and cultural projects. Provisions are also made in the context of my Department's multi-annual budgets for the period to 2001. The Deputy will also be aware of the ongoing multi-annual capital programme funded from EU Structural Funds and Exchequer sources. There are also specific commitments in regard to which work is ongoing in the context of the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium. The Deputy will appreciate that many commitments are involved and it would be unrealistic to seek to itemise each and every one. If, however, the Deputy has any particular commitment in mind, I would be glad to look into the matter further if he can indicate the specific issue in question.</P>

      <P>I am the Minister responsible for the issue of certificates under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to allow a project to be treated as a qualifying film for the purposes of the section. An application to be eligible for consideration must be submitted before the principal photography, the first drawings, or the first model movement have commenced as the case may be depending on whether the film is live action, documentary or animation. Subsection (2)(a)(ii) precludes certification in cases in which an application is submitted after the date of such commencement.</P>
      <P>In regard to an investment raised under section 481, such a sum is eligible for tax relief only if it is used by the qualifying company within two years of the receipt of the sum for the purposes of enabling the qualifying company to produce the film in question.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland ratified the Granada Convention in January 1997. Since assuming office I have taken significant steps to enhance the protection of the architectural heritage in accordance with the principles and objectives of the convention. The Deputy will also be aware of the package of legislative, administrative and financial proposals agreed by Government and announced by me and my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in May 1998. The legislative measures include a new Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, going through the Oireachtas, which will provide comprehensive protection of buildings and structures of architectural heritage importance, and a Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, which is being carried out by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, on a statutory basis. I am steering this Bill through the Oireachtas. The package introduces <Col N="1365" /> a grant-aid scheme of almost £4 million per annum for the carrying out of preservation/ conservation works, and includes provisions for conservation expertise.</P>
      <P>These initiatives serve to strengthen our core commitments under the Granada Convention in relation to the maintenance of inventories, statutory protection, the provision of financial support of conservation works and the promotion of training in conservation skills.</P>

      <P>The primary task of the Screen Commission is to market abroad the many attractions of Ireland as a film and television production location. Its specific terms of reference are as follows: to promote Ireland as a film and television production location and centre internationally by marketing the tax advantages and other incentives, the range of facilities, the body of professional crew, actors and creative personnel, and the variety of locations available; to faciltate incoming and indigenous production by providing information from a one stop source by co-ordinating a network of national and regional organisations, commercial, State and State-sponsored companies and individuals; to encourage the location of international distribution companies, facilities companies, creative and talent agencies and international producers to Ireland on a long-term strategic basis; generally to promote Ireland as a film and television production location internationally to attract film and television production to Ireland, and to co-ordinate and integrate as appropriate the efforts of local bodies with similar objectives.</P>
      <P>I established the Screen Commission on an operational basis last year and it has since been actively carrying out its functions.

I am confident that my activity will contribute to continuing invest<Col N="1368" /> ment in film production in Ireland. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the decision of film producers to locate anywhere is influenced by many complex considerations and is ultimately a commercial one.</P>

This package will be applied countrywide and I urge affected landowners or cutters from the north Galway and west Roscommon areas who have not yet done so, to contact local officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, who will be pleased to discuss matters with them.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to vary at this time any of the terms on offer and which were the product of long and painstaking consultations. I am arranging to forward for the Deputy's information a copy of my recent press release on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the population trends on the offshore islands as published on pages 128 and 129 of &ldquo;Census 96 &ndash; Population Classified by Area&rdquo;, volume 1, and I have noted that, while there has been a decrease in the population of a number of those islands granted island status by my Department, the overall number inhabiting these islands has increased between 1991 and 1996. With a view to continuing this trend, I have introduced a number of measures aimed at <Col N="1370" /> improving the living conditions of island inhabitants.</P>
      <P>I am continuing the process of implementing an action plan to address the needs of our islands as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In 1998, I announced assistance of almost £3.9 million towards various capital works on islands. This programme of works is being carried out in partnership with local authorities.</P>
      <P>Access to the mainland was one of the main issues raised with me on the various occasions I met with island communities and their representatives. Since I assumed responsibility for the offshore islands I have provided significant funding for access,  including over £1.7 million for the inhabited islands off the coast of County Cork and for the first time ferry services to and from Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island have been subsidised. The announcement in the recent budget of the doubling of new house grants on islands is a major boost to islanders wishing to build new homes for themselves.</P>
      <P>Through the interdepartmental committee on the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, the implementation of Government policy on the offshore islands is co-ordinated so as to ensure it is implemented in an effective manner. As chairman of this committee I will continue to endeavour to ensure equal access to services such as health, education, water, roads, electricity, refuse collection etc., for our island communities.</P>
      <P>Numerous positive decisions have been made following discussions at the interdepartmental committee by various Government Departments in relation to the islands. I have succeeded in obtaining an increase of 30 per cent in funding for the offshore islands in 1999 and this additional funding will further assist me in continuing with the work which I have already outlined.</P>

      <P>The National Archives does not intend to have the 1911 census returns bound in the same manner as the 1901 census returns and is not aware of any returns having been stolen due to their being in loose-leaf form. The 1901 census returns were bound in the 1970s. This seemed desirable at the time, but the manner in which they were bound would now be considered inappropriate as a means of ensuring their long-term preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1911 census returns are being microfilmed, and it is expected that all counties will have been filmed before the end of the year 2000. Members <Col N="1371" /> of the public wishing to inspect the returns will then be required to use microfilm copies rather than the original returns. This will allow members of the public to have self-service access to copies of the films in the National Archives, and will enable local libraries to acquire copies of the films for consultation in locations outside Dublin, as well as meeting the requirement for security of the original material.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to previous replies to similar questions, in particular my reply to Questions Nos. 63 and 138 of 18 June 1998. As I stated on that occasion, at present Teilifís na Gaeilge operates as an RTE service under the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1993. The issue raised by the Deputy is the day to day responsibility of the RTE authority on the advice <Col N="1372" /> of Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge and I have no statutory function in the matter. However, in accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of its national broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>RTE informs me that: Teilifís na Gaeilge is available to 95 per cent of the population on the UHF band; reception is not available yet in parts of the counties of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Cork and Kerry; subject to the acquistion of suitable sites and planning permission, it hopes that when the 1999 programme of development is completed coverage of Teilifís na Gaeilge will be comparable to that of RTE 1 and Network 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Formal consultations in relation to the pro<Col N="1374" /> posed life assurance disclosure regulations have taken place between my Department and all interested parties, including the Irish Insurance Federation, Irish Brokers Association, Professional Insurance Brokers Association, Consumers Association of Ireland, the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Pensions Board. Despite the fact that the formal consultation process has almost concluded, submissions continue to be received and considered by my Department. The draft regulations are currently undergoing examination and legal drafting in the parliamentary draftsman's office. My objective is that the regulations will be in operation from 1 September next and I have been exhorting all in the insurance industry and all those affected to plan on that basis. The House will be aware that I have been signalling the proposed introduction of these important regulations since assuming office.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies have raised concerns about the possible discriminatory impact of the proposed regulations. In that regard, my Department has sought the expert assistance of the Society of Actuaries to frame the regulations in such a way that will avoid unfairly discriminating between commission disclosure by brokers and other insurance intermediaries, on the one hand, and disclosure of remuneration for salesforces employed directly by the insurers themselves or through tied agents such as banks and building societies, on the other. We have devised a formula, with the co-operation of the Society of Actuaries, which I believe will achieve equivalence of disclosure, as far as is practicable, between the different distribution channels.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a misconception that the charges and expenses, including sales remuneration, associated with the selling of all life assurance products by insurance companies directly or by tied agents, such as banks and building societies, will not be disclosed to the consumer. I assure the Deputies and the House that this is not the case. I referred to this matter in a recent interview with the official journal of the Irish Brokers Association in which I emphasised that the whole thrust of the draft regulations and the supporting actuarial guidance notes is to ensure a level playing field in disclosure requirements as between different methods of distribution.</P>
    <P>As recent events will testify, it has become evident that there is a consumer information deficit in regard to the purchasing of life assurance products resulting in consumers making uninformed and sometimes ill-informed decisions which may impact only in the long-term. To remedy that market failure, the life assurance transparency regulations which I propose to introduce will provide the consumer, as of legal right, with easy to understand pre-contractual and post-contractual information on the essential features of life assurance products, including all charges and surrender values.</P>
    <P>The prime objectives in the formulation of this new regulatory regime will be to: simplify the <Col N="1375" /> presentation of such products to the consumer; minimise the scope for mis-selling, including churning of policies; ensure complete transparency of all charges and expenses; identify the principal with whom the insurance consumer is dealing and provide adequate redress through a firm statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I will now address in some detail the specific issues raised by the Deputies, regarding the proposed disclosure of commissions in relation to protection-only insurance products and the question of equivalence as between the different sales and distribution channels. First, in relation to non-investment insurance products, I am concerned about the possibility inherent in the commission payments system of creating a disclosure lacuna, effectively a loophole, which could be open to manipulation and create competitive distortions. I also believe that there are sound consumer information requirement reasons for enabling commission levels, and I use the term in its broadest sense, for all products to be monitored, particularly in the light of statutory powers available to the Minister under section 37 of the Insurance Act, 1989, to control commission levels. The Deputies should also be aware of the existence of enabling provisions in the Consumer Credit Act which provide for disclosure of commissions and fees on insurance products sold in connection with purchasing a house, as, for example, mortgage protection policies. For these specific reasons, and in the general interest of transparency and consumer information I do not see how protection-only insurance products could justifiably be excluded from the commission payments-sales remuneration disclosure requirements of the proposed regulations.</P>
    <P>For the record, and for the benefit of the House, I would like to emphasise that commission and sales remuneration disclosure is but one element of these very comprehensive and consumer-friendly proposals and I include an appendix to this reply which gives a short outline of the other all-inclusive provisions. A core element in the draft regulations will be the provision to the prospective policyholder of an illustrative tabular statement containing two distinct parts. Part I of that table will analyse the total deductions from the premium, including specific life insurance company expenses, charges and loadings, and will indicate the ultimate value of the product over the lifetime of the policy. Part II of the table will state intermediary commissions or, on an equivalent basis, direct sales remuneration as well as assisting consumers to identify possible product or provider bias. As stated previously, the main elements of commission equivalent have been identified in the supporting actuarial guidance notes.</P>
    <P>The proposals as outlined not only supplement the minimum life assurance policyholder disclosure requirements under EU directives but also greatly exceed them in terms of effectiveness and overall content. The regulations will also bring <Col N="1376" /> about a level of consistency across the insurance industry in so far as consumer protection measures are concerned and indeed will act as a catalyst to encourage other competing financial services providers to institute comparable transparency measures.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Life Disclosure Regulations</i>The draft regulations are aimed at informing any person who proposes, directly to an insurer or indirectly through an insurance intermediary, to purchase a life assurance product. It is proposed that all suppliers of life assurance must supply to the customer, before he-she signs a proposal or application form, information, in writing, in a clear, prominent and accurate manner, as prescribed in the draft regulations. Full details must be provided of the supplier of life assurance, including the legal form of the insurance name, the regulatory authority responsible, the level of delegated authority granted by the insurer to the intermediary, and details of the nature of the relationship between the insurer and the intermediary.</P>
    <P>Information must be provided in respect of the terms and conditions of the proposed insurance policy, including information on the benefits and options available to the proposer and the laws applicable to the contract; the circumstances under which the contract may be cancelled by either party and the arrangements for application of the cooling-off period which will remain at 15 days, as heretofore; the means of calculation and distribution of bonuses and a statement of the units to which the benefits are linked and the assets underlying unit-linked policies; the arrangements for handling disputes about the life assurance policy including the option of recourse to the insurance ombudsman service; the purpose and intention of the policy, that is, whether it is a protection or savings policy, or a combination of both; the type of policy, for example, regular premium savings or single premium investment, regular or single premium pension, whether critical illness cover or permanent health insurance is included and whether policies are index-linked; the long-term nature of the policy and level of monetary commitment given in that regard; a statement outlining the cost of the insurance policy and the means and duration of payment of premiums; a prominent statement indicating whether the policy acquires a surrender or early encashment value and the consequences of cessation of payment of premiums; a prominent statement indicating that early surrender of the policy, whether through non-payment of premiums or voluntarily, may result in a surrender value which is less than the aggregate of the premiums paid up to the date of surrender; annual statements to be provided to policyholders indicating as a minimum current premium payable and current surrender values and anti-churning provisions.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations also provide that information shall be made available to the policy<Col N="1377" /> holder, during the term of the insurance contract, related to any change in the name, legal form or address of the insurer.</P>

The group may commission detailed sectoral studies as required and will also, in its work, review the evolution of competition policy at EU and global level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the review group is to <Col N="1378" /> make recommendations designed to further improve on our competition regime in terms of its legislative provisions and its structures. The treatment of mergers under competition law and the consolidation and improvement of mergers legislation will be central to this work. The group is also reviewing the position of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, particularly the below cost selling aspects of the order, with a view to making appropriate recommendations in this regard for the future.</P>
    <P>To date the group has met on 36 occasions. The group has published two discussion documents entitled <i>Proposals for Discussion in Relation to Mergers </i>(July 1998) and <i>Proposals for Discussion in Relation to Some Recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry </i>(February, 1999). The group is continuing with its work and is now considering issues related to the Competition Acts and the Groceries Order. I expect the group to make its final report later this year.</P>

      <P>Generally, public-private partnership in projects is understood to <Col N="1379" /> involve the private sector in designing, planning, constructing and-or operating infrastructure projects normally provided by the State. This can often involve a switch by the State from capital expenditure now to current expenditure in the future.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have not had occasion to authorise my Department to participate in any public-private partnerships in the strict sense of that term. However, on a somewhat wider definition, there are a number of public-private partnerships, either planned or under way, involving agencies of my Department. For example, the IDA has been working with the private sector to develop a digital park. In addition, significant advances have been made by the IDA during the past year in pioneering new public-private partnership approaches to provide advance buildings to attract new overseas investors, especially into regional locations. Shannon Development Company is involved with similar arrangements for the provision of industrial property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, through its community enterprise centre programme, also provides opportunities for partnership between the public and private sectors. Funding for these centres is drawn from a number of sources including Enterprise Ireland, local authorities, EU and the private sector. Enterprise Ireland also facilitates <Col N="1380" /> the operation of seed and venture capital funds involving public and private sector partnership. My Department will, of course, be exploring the possibilities for use of public-private partnership in the context of the forthcoming National Development Plan.</P>

      <Col N="1381" /> Minister of State Kitt also attended two meetings of the General Affairs Council which were held on 11 December 1997 and 18 May 1998 to discuss trade issues.</P>
    <P>Minister of State Kitt met the then British Trade Minister on 25 July 1997. He also met with the Austrian and British Ministers who have responsibility for EU Labour and Social Affairs matters in Dublin on 23 February and 22 May 1998 respectively. He had a meeting with the Austrian Trade Minister in Dublin on 26 June 1998. On 3 October 1998, in response to his invitation, the Austrian Minister for Women's Affairs and Consumer Protection addressed a forum in Dublin entitled Consumer Policy and the Amsterdam Treaty. In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, held discussions with the British Trade Minister on 11 January 1999 on the occasion of his visiting Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, met with his European colleagues at a Colloquium of Research Ministers which took place in London on 28 April 1998. Officials from my Department meet regularly with officials from other EU member states and the European Commission during, or at the margins of, meetings of Council and European Commission working groups. Such meetings take place almost on a daily basis. Officials also have bilateral meetings with the Commission from time to time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently met a number of large retail multiples to discuss the concern among consumers that falling farm gate prices have not been reflected in retail prices in the shops. The multiples maintained, in general, that any reductions in the prices which they pay to processors have been reflected in their retail prices and the most recent CSO data would indicate that some of the reductions in farm producer prices have been passed on to consumers. However, the specific detailed information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>A search has been carried out within my Department but no records have been found dating back to the 1960s in relation to examinations or reports on the company referred to by the Deputy. Files dealing with inspections of specific employers premises were transferred to the Health and Safety Authority on its foundation in 1989.</P>
      <P>The recognition of the danger caused by asbestos was slow in developing and I understand there can be a long latency period in that diseases associated with the product may only manifest themselves after 20 to 30 years. The first legislation to be introduced by the European Council to combat this danger was in September 1983 when Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work was adopted; this was subsequently updated and amended by Council Directive 91/382/EEC.</P>
      <P>Ireland had already in place the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1972, which were replaced by the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1975. These early regulations recognised some of the dangers presented by this hazardous agent and were basically concerned with the hygiene and cleanliness aspects of working with asbestos. The intention behind the regulations was to exclude asbestos from the place of work.</P>
      <P>Ireland introduced further legislation, the European Communities (Protecton of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989, which were amended in 1993. These regulations place a duty on employers whose work involves coming into contact with asbestos or materials containing asbestos to make assessments of the exposure to asbestos in the air in the place of work. They have a duty to ensure that employees are not exposed to concentrations above limits indicated in the regulations. Employees also have the right to be provided with suitable protective equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The Health and Safety Authority is the statutory body responsible for the promotion of occupational safety and health and for the day to day administration and enforcement of relevant statutory provisions in this area. The regulations mentioned above give wide ranging powers to inspectors of the authority to inspect places of work to ensure that the regulations are being complied with. Ultimately the authority may apply to the court to prohibit work being carried on which they believe may cause exposure to asbestos.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that the marketing and use of all types of asbestos with the exception of chrysotile (white asbestos) have been banned in this country since the mid-1980s. A proposal to ban white asbestos is currently being examined at EU level.</P>

      <P>I recently announced my Department's coastal protection plan for 1999 under which financial assistance will be provided in respect of two further projects in County Mayo. In view of the considerable calls on the funding available for coast protection, I regret that it is unlikely to be possible to provide further grant aid to Mayo County Council this year.</P>

As I advised the sanctuary and as I have indicated to the House previously, seals are a protected wildlife species under the terms of the Wildlife Acts which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. While I have therefore no direct function in relation to the funding of the Irish Seal Sanctuary, I should add that the Marine Institute has ongoing contacts with the Irish Seal Sanctuary and facilitates access to its programmes where appropriate. I will in addition bring the concerns of the sanctuary to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <P>At present there are no public-private partnerships in operation in which my Department or associated state bodies are participants. However, my Department and associated State bodies do co-operate closely with the private sector across a range of activities. An example of this is a joint venture between the Marine Institute and Marine Technology Ltd. to develop and operate a technical research and development support base in Galway.</P>

      <P>This question refers to standard operational procedures applicable in the medical evacuation of a fisherman with an eye injury from the MFV Nozdie on 21 January, 1999 and the inaccurate media reports following the incident. The Air Corps helicopter was on the ground at Waterford Airport when the incident commenced for the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCCD) Dublin, and it had earlier that morning carried out training flights in the Waterford area. The standard operational reporting procedure between the MRCC Dublin and rescue resources (whether helicopter, lifeboat, coastal teams, rescue boat, etc.) requires a 15 minute updating of location and if this is not forthcoming MRCC must call the resource. Arising from the incident and in order to improve communications, IMES Coast Radio Stations were reminded on 30 January 1999 to ensure the normal 15 minute reporting and monitoring checks with all four Irish SAR helicopters on operational and training missions were carried out.</P>

      <P>Given their speed of travel, marine emergency response helicopters are regional assets available to respond to emergencies in any part of the Irish search and rescue region. When a marine emergency is notified to the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Dublin and a helicopter response is deemed necessary by the duty search and rescue mission co-ordinator, the most appropriate, available helicopter is tasked to respond to the emergency. Marine emergency helicopters are base-located so that they can reach, by day 40 nautical miles off-shore in one hour, and by night or in bad weather, 100 nautical in two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently marine emergency helicopter coverage is provided by two all-weather medium load carrying, Sikorsky S61N helicopters on contract to my Department and based at Shannon and Dublin Airports and two Air Corps helicopters, one all weather light-load carrying Dauphin helicopter based at Finner Army Camp, County Donegal and a daylight and inshore only Alouette 111 based at Waterford Airport. The Marine Emergency Service helicopter coverage will be improved on the 1 July 1999 when the Air Corps Alouette 111 helicopter based at Waterford Airport is replaced by an Air Corps, all-weather, 24 hour, Dauphin helicopter service assuming that the Air Corps crew numbers remain stable. This upgrading will complete the marine emergency helicopter infrastructure. The distances in nautical miles to Cork from Finner <Col N="1388" /> Army Camp is 160.3, from Shannon is 54.4, or from Dublin 125.8, and from Waterford 56.2 nautical miles.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I signed an Agreement between the Irish and British Governments establishing six North-South Implementation Bodies under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement in question has been laid in the library of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Among the six new North-South institutions being established is a body on language, one part of which will comprise an agency devoted to the promotion of the Irish language on a North-South basis. The functions and scope of the Irish Language Agency are set out in the Agreement which I signed yesterday. This Agreement will be given domestic effect in legislation which is being introduced in the Dáil today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the language body for the important part it can play in meeting the commitments to support the Irish language in the Good Friday Agreement. The language body will have an important role in regard to the general promotion of the Irish language on the island, but most particularly in Northern Ireland. For the first time there will be specific budgetary provisions for the Irish language in Northern Ireland. This represents a very fundamental change in the position of the language there and demonstrates clearly the inclusive nature of the new structures now being established. I also welcome the opportunity the language body will provide to promote a greater awareness of Ulster-Scots culture.</P>

      <P>The General Affairs Council and the Development Council are the two formations of the European Unions Council of Ministers of primary concern to the Department of Foreign Affairs. In the normal course, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attended the General Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>I also attend the informal meetings of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, or the Gymnich-type meetings as they are called, and which are usually organised once during each Presidency.</P>
      <P>In the Development Co-operation area, the relevant body is the Development Council, which normally meets every six months, and which is normally attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for development co-operation, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>I include for the Deputy's information lists of the meetings of the General Affairs Council, of the Development Council and of the informal meetings of Foreign Ministers, which have been held since the Minister of State and I, respectively, took up office.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council meets, under normal circumstances, once per month and meetings are scheduled well in advance. In most cases it is possible for me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to arrange to be present. The Deputy will understand, however, that it can happen on occasion that other business might require particular attention at a particular time. On such occasions, I would normally be represented by a Minister of State or, in very exceptional circumstances, by the Permanent Representative to the European Union.</P>
      <P>It can also happen that a particular meeting of the General Affairs Council may be held to discuss a particular issue, for instance, trade questions, and in such circumstances, the Council would be attended by the appropriate Minister, Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has special responsibility for trade matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, in particular those posted at the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, meet, almost on a daily basis, officials of the Council, of the Commission and national officials of other member states at Council and Commission work<Col N="1390" /> ing groups and other meetings.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 22 February, which I attended, the issue of Ocalan was discussed. Following our discussion a declaration was issued in the name of the Union which took note of the assurance of the Turkish Government that Abdullah Ocalan would have a fair trial. However, the Union made clear that it expected this to mean fair and correct treatment and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court, with access to legal counsel of his choice and with international observers admitted to the trial. We also underlined once more our strict opposition to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>As regards the demonstrations by Kurdish supporters, the EU strongly deplored the fact that the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan had sparked massive unrest and violent acts which has resulted in death, hostage-taking, intimidation and extensive destruction. We reaffirmed our position that such acts of violence are inadmissible and under no circumstances tolerable.</P>
      <P>The EU again condemned all forms of terrorism and stated that the legitimate fight against terrorism must be conducted in full respect of human rights, the rule of law and democratic norms. We emphasised that legitimate interests must be expressed through a political process, not through violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU fully upholds the territorial integrity of Turkey. At the same time, we expect Turkey to resolve its problems by political means with full respect for human rights, the rule of law in a democratic society and in full accordance with Turkey's commitments as a member of the Council of Europe. In this context we expressed a welcome for all genuine efforts to separate the fight <Col N="1392" /> against terrorism from the search for political solutions and to promote conciliation. In support of this we indicated that the Union stands ready to contribute, including through continued financial assistance. Finally, we emphasised that Turkey's efforts in dealing with these problems in this spirit could not but affect EU-Turkey relations positively.</P>
    <P>In recent days the Turkish authorities have granted unrestricted access to Ocalan in Imrali prison to representatives of the Council of Europe. Ireland welcomes this development and we are convinced that the granting of a transparent free and fair trial to Ocalan can only have a positive effect on the development of EU relations with Turkey and on Turkey's EU candidature.</P>
    <P>Further, a recent visiting parliamentary delegation from Turkey was informed of Ireland's concern about Ocalan's right to a transparent, free and fair trial. They responded to my concerns positively.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs does not procure materials directly for emergency humanitarian or development programmes. Assistance is provided in the form of cash grants channelled through international aid organisations and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which have a proven track record in providing prompt and effective intervention in humanitarian emerg-encies.</P>
      <P>We believe that these agencies are best placed to assess everyday needs in crisis situations. Funded agencies are free to purchase the necessary relief goods by a process of competitive tenders which maximise the value and quantity of relief aid and ensures value for taxpayers' money. It is open to Irish commercial interests to tender for the supply of such goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> It is not the practice of the Government, furthermore, to specify which products should be purchased when making grants to NGOs or international agencies or to engage in what is known as tied aid, as there are strong development arguments against this. Tying of aid also reduces competition and transparency and results in poor value for aid money. Furthermore, in emergency crisis situations we believe that NGOs should have flexibility in assessing their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is and always has been my policy that transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them. I am committed to bringing about a situation where public transport facilities are fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Bus Átha Cliath currently has six low floor single decker buses in operation on the No. 3 route, Belfield to Drumcondra, and the company has given a commitment that, from now on, all single-deck buses due for renewal will be replaced by low-floor equivalents.</P>
      <P>At my request, the company is preparing a broad programme of trials of possible low floor buses. Details are being finalised, but I expect these to include double deck; articulated; and alternative fuel buses. These trials, together with the experience of their existing low floor single deck buses and a further 20 fully accessible 33 seater midi buses which the company will purchase this year will provide the basis for decisions on the future fleet replacement programme.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has a further ten low-floor vehicles on order. These vehicles are due for delivery in 1999 and will be put into service on Bus Éireann's Cork and Limerick city routes.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made in making the railway accessible to people with disabilities. Iarnród Éireann has published an accessibility guide for passengers. Almost all of the approximately 90 mainline stations are accessible by wheelchair users. All of the newer rail passenger carriages, including the DART, are accessible by wheelchair users. In addition, the new DART stations at Drumcondra, and Clontarf Road and the upgraded Dún Laoghaire station are all fully accessible.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to report that each of the companies, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, have now established user groups representative of people with disabilities. The input from these groups gives the companies very valuable assistance in their ongoing programmes of improving the suitability of their services for mobility-impaired customers.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the replies to Questions Nos. 7, 40 and 60 by the Minister for Public Enterprise on 18 February 1999.</P>
      <P>The current capacity of the gas interconnector between Scotland and Ireland is 9-10 million standard cubic metres per day. Bord Gáis will enhance the capacity of the interconnector to 17 million standard cubic metres per day by means of additional compression to be provided in the years 2000 and 2001. There will then be adequate capacity to meet forecast gas demands to 2004.</P>
      <P>A study of gas demand to the year 2025, based on a number of growth scenarios, being carried out by Bord Gáis and my Department, shows that by 2005 daily peak demand for gas for domestic, industrial and other purposes will grow to between 17.1 and 25.2 million standard cubic metres. The necessary additional gas transmission infrastructure to cater for the demand for gas from 2004 will be put in place in good time.</P>
      <P>There have been recent newspaper reports about a number of proposals and options for the provision of additional gas infrastructure, all of which will be carefully considered by me.</P>

      <P>I understand that preliminary feasibility work was carried out by CIE in the course of its preparation of the public transport investment needs review for the greater Cork area. The review was submitted to my Department but not the supporting preparatory work. Publication of any of the preparatory work would be a matter for the company.</P>
      <P>The CIE review concluded that, based on current population levels and commuter patterns, the necessary investment in the Cork to Midleton line could not be justified in the short to medium term, but that the option should be kept under review in the longer term.</P>
      <P>In a report I made to Government last week on the future development of suburban rail in Dublin and Cork I suggested that the reopening of this line could be considered, not on the basis of current passenger demand but in anticipation of future developments. The Government agreed that I should arrange for the detailed costing and feasibility work on the various suburban rail proposals. The outcome of this work will be considered as part of the strategic transport needs for the country as a whole in the context of the preparation of the national development plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The company was paid grants totalling £111,570 in respect of research and development <Col N="1403" /> activities at the Midleton plant. It also assumed liability for research and development grants of £73,539 paid to the previous owners. Based on the proposed timescale announced by the company for the scaling down of its operations at Midleton, no repayment liability will exist in respect of these grants.</P>
    <P>The company advances commercial reasons for the scaling down of its activities at Midleton. It has incurred losses for several years and contends that, due to the limited size of Ireland's vegetable market it cannot benefit from the economies of scale enjoyed by its European competitors. My Department is working closely with Enterprise Ireland to secure an alternative enterprise for the Midleton facility.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted a ten month application for special beef premium in respect of 20 animals in February 1998. However, one of the tag numbers listed by the person named on the beef premium application was also listed by the person named on a 1998 suckler cow premium application. Payment was delayed until it could be established if the animal in question is, in fact, a male and therefore eligible for special beef premium. This query has now been resolved and the advance payment, in respect of 20 animals, is expected to issue within the next 14 days.</P>

      <P>All applications are processed in each of the Department's local offices in strict order of receipt. In general, the longer processing time in some counties is attributable to the higher volume of applications under the various EU schemes. However, in no case does the processing time result in financial loss to a retiring farmer. The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Community and national legislation, cattle born since 1996 must be identified <i>inter alia</i>, by means of two plastic ear tags each containing the same unique tag number. An animal bearing only one plastic ear tag is not properly identified and must not be moved from a holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a small number of cases cattle are presented for slaughter at meat plants/abbattoirs with a single ear tag. Exceptionally, and to deal with such cases, my Department has recently introduced arrangements to allow such animals to be considered for slaughter provided not more than a percentage of the animals in the consignment are missing one ear tag and that the animals in question comply with the other EU identification requirements, that is, (i) that they have a valid passport document, (ii) that they are recorded on the national registration database and (iii) that they are correctly recorded in the herdowner's <Col N="1412" /> onfarm herd register. Experience has shown that where animals are correctly and securely tagged in accordance with instructions, tag loss in transit is low.</P>

The schemes will be confined to farmers with enterprises involving not more than 100 income units including off farm income. Typically this would include farmers with either a dairy enterprise which has an annual milk quota of up to 40,000 gallons or a suckler cow and beef enterprise with up to 50 suckler cows and followers.</P>

Details on the exact number received by each Department, which includes requests received by public bodies under the aegis of Government Departments, are set out on the attached summary table. This table also includes a breakdown of the outcome of each request received by end January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attached table records the number of requests refused in the first instance. The position under the Freedom of Information Act is that <Col N="1418" /> requesters have up to six months in which to lodge an appeal when they are not satisfied with decisions taken on their requests, initially at a higher level within the public body to whom the request was directed and subsequently to the Office of the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>While the summary table provides particulars with regard to Government Departments, the Deputy will be aware that the Freedom of Information Act also applies to health boards and local authorities. In this regard, my Department will ensure that details of freedom of information requests to these bodies will be provided directly to him in due course.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that tax harmonisation and tax competition issues are not being negotiated as part of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The issues are entirely separate. While tax policy co-operation and combating harmful tax competition are being actively pursued at present under various EU initiatives, including the code of conduct on business taxation and the proposed directive on the taxation of savings income, tax harmonisation as such does not form part of the EU's agenda. This position was confirmed at last December's Heads of Government summit in Vienna.</P>

      <P>The Government has endorsed a public private partnership, or &ldquo;PPP&rdquo;, approach, on a pilot basis, to public capital projects in Ireland. The initial concentration will be on economic infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>This approach reflects the recommendations of the report commissioned from Farrell Grant Sparks and Goodbody economic consultants in association with Chesterton Consulting by my Department last year. The Government also approved the establishment of a central public private partnership unit in my Department as recommended by the consultants. The PPP unit in my Department was set up in January of this year. A PPP unit has also been established in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I understand that the establishment of a unit in the Department of Public Enterprise is being considered.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to announce in the next few weeks a list of pilot projects on which I expect substantial progress to be made by the end of this year. My Department is discussing possible projects for inclusion in the list with the relevant line Departments. It would be inappropriate for me to specify today the candidates for inclusion in that list, as consideration of their suitability is not yet complete and a decision has not yet been made on their inclusion. However, I can say that the priority area for projects is roads. In respect of bodies for which I am directly responsible, the possibility of including in the list some projects involving the Office of Public Works is being considered.</P>
      <P>The parameters to be adopted in deciding on the merits of the PPP approach in any particular case will depend on the economic case for the project; the impact, if any, on the general Government balance; the cost effectiveness of any private funding under PPP as compared with normal public funding; efficiency gains which private sector involvement could secure and other criteria including the potential to generate revenue, legal and regulatory aspects and possible supply constraints in the construction sector. In looking at the prospective pilot projects, the key considerations are long-term value for money and their priority at national level. However, their suitability for PPP and what we may learn from them for a wider application of PPP are also important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department is endeavouring to keep all the interested parties, including possible investors, informed of Government policy on PPPs and up to date with developments, it is not in negotiation with any investors at this time. With <Col N="1420" /> regard to PPP projects already under way, such projects have been put in place in a wide range of areas. I understand that the relevant line Departments will be providing details of such projects in replies to the parliamentary question which the Deputy put to all Ministers. As regards my own area, I am informed that a total of 22 projects were carried out on a PPP basis by the Office of Public Works as part of the decentralisation programme, totalling some £109 million.</P>
    <P>However, I believe there is real scope to deepen and widen co-operation between the private and public sectors. I am committed to public private partnership as a central part of the future development of our infrastructure. I am confident that the pilot projects will provide a sound and sustainable basis to extend the PPP process in the future into a range of areas where it can provide the optimum benefits for the national economy and the public purse.</P>

      <P>The Councils relevant to my Department are (i) the Economic and Finance Ministers' Council, ECOFIN and (ii) the Budget Council. There have been 22 meetings of ECOFIN since I took office on 26 June 1997 and I have attended all of these meetings. Ministers of State, Deputy Cullen and Deputy Byrne, have on my behalf, attended four meetings of the EU Budget Council since that date.</P>
      <P>Meetings of the EURO-11 group normally precede the meetings of the ECOFIN Council and I have attended all seven meetings of the Euro-11 group since its inception on 4 June 1998. The EURO-11 group is comprised of the member states participating in the euro. Its meetings are informal and discussions cover issues connected with shared specific responsibilities for the single currency.</P>
      <P>Ministers for Finance also attend European Council meetings of Heads of State or Government as occasion demands. I have attended three of the European Councils, in Luxembourg, Cardiff and Vienna held since I have taken office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, meetings with Ministers of Finance from all other member states occur regularly on the margins of Council meetings, by arrangement or otherwise. I also <Col N="1421" /> meet Ministers of Finance outside the ECOFIN format as the occasion demands, for example, in the pre-Presidency visits which are normally undertaken by incoming Presidencies. The last such meeting was with Minister Lafontaine of Germany. Of course, I also meet regularly with the President and members of the European Commission on matters of policy relevant to my Department.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are in regular contact with officials from the Commission and other member states in a variety of different contexts. These range from formal, regular, high level statutory committees such as the economic and financial committee &ndash; meeting monthly, the taxation policy group &ndash; which meets approximately three times a year, the code of conduct group on business taxation &ndash; currently meeting about every three weeks &ndash; and other high level <i>ad hoc</i> groupings, to the various Council and Commission working groups established to process EU legislation on other matters, for example, financial legislation and Structural Fund regulations.</P>
    <P>Bilateral meetings between officials of my Department and their counterparts in other member states, in the Commission and in other institutions of the Community also occur on a regular basis. Such meetings are an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department across a wide range of its activities.</P>

The Office of Public Works' resident engineer for the south west region also compiled a factual report of the flood event at that time. The resources of my office, however, have been and are currently fully committed to the completion of the flood alleviation schemes in the areas nominated for priority under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995. Consequently, there are no plans, at present, to consider the possibility of a flood relief scheme for Freemount, County Cork.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to funding of public service occupational pensions. The majority of such pension schemes are not funded. They are financed on a pay as you go basis. Recent actuarial studies suggest that the cost of public service pensions, expressed in constant price terms, will increase fourfold over the next 30 years.</P>
      <P>This issue was referred to in the interim report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions which was published in November 1997. In that report, the commission stated that the evolution of pension costs required careful monitoring. It noted that funding, were it to be introduced on a full or partial basis, would raise significant practical and budgetary issues. It went on to say that it would consider the full range of arguments regarding funding in its final report, taking into account the experience of other countries.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, I look forward to receiving the recommendations of the commission which is to report shortly</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to e.coli 0157. In 1995-96 new departments of public health were established in each health board. The new specialists in public health identified as a priority the need to improve collaboration and communication between microbiologists, environmental health officers and the new public health departments. In late 1996, the specialists requested all laboratories to inform public health departments of detected cases of e.coli 0157. The criteria employed by laboratories to test for e.coli 0157 were expanded and the introduction of newer techniques of culture enrichment and immunomagnetic systems dramatically improved the sensitivity of isolation, and the use of sero diagnostic studies in outbreaks improved the detection of infection by testing for antibodies to e.coli 0157.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These technological and administrative devel<Col N="1426" /> opments have contributed to an increase in the number of e.coli 0157 cases reported from eight in 1996, 31 in 1997 and 76 in 1998. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established an e.coli 0157 task force to advise on the appropriate response to the increase in the number of reported cases of e.coli 0157 in terms of regulation, standards and education for consumers and producers. I understand that its report is currently being finalised and will be available in the near future.</P>
    <P>As indicated in previous replies, the recently established National Communicable Disease Surveillance Unit, which will provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne disease, will participate in a review this year in the whole area of disease notification, and e.coli 0157 is being included in this review.</P>

The scheme does not cover the cost of any treatments that may be administered by a patient's general practioner. Neither is the scheme designed to cover the cost of medicines that are dispensed to patients by general practioners. This is in line with the Department's current policy in respect of the refund of drugs and drug cost subsidisation schemes.</P>

    <P>In North America and Western Europe cases of AIDS and deaths from AIDS have been decreasing over the last few years. However, there has been no significant reduction in the incidence of HIV so while antiretroviral drug therapies keep already-infected people alive, the proportion of the population living with HIV has actually grown. My Department monitors closely the levels of AIDS in the US and all other countries and I view the rise in cases of HIV as a cause of concern but I am encouraged by the decline in the overall rate of increase.</P>
    <P>Irish figures on HIV-AIDS reflect those in the developed world, with a lowering of cases and deaths from AIDS in recent years but a rise in the number of cases of HIV. The rate of increase has, however, stabilised. My Department con<Col N="1445" /> tinues to make available a range of materials and literature to educate the public, especially young people about the dangers of HIV-AIDS. The health promotion unit has run a media campaign to coincide with national and world AIDS days. Specific messages have been placed in the washroom areas of third level colleges and some night clubs and pool halls. Most recently the decision by the Department of Education and Science to introduce relationship and sexuality education into schools will also contribute to creating a greater awareness of the issues among young people.</P>

      <P>The appointment of additional occupational therapists is a matter for the relevant health board. In the case of County Roscommon, this would be a matter for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>This year, an additional £3 million revenue, rising to £6 million on a full-year cost basis in the year 2000, has been allocated to the health boards for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, the Western Health Board received £300,000 for development of services in this sector in its area. Priorities for the allocation of this funding will be decided by the board in consultation with its Regional Co-ordinating Committee for Physical and Sensory Disability Services. The appointment of additional occupational therapists will be considered by the board in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal was established under the Health Act, 1970 (No. 1 of 1970). Its statutory functions are defined under section 41(1) of that Act and include the regulation of the number and type of consultant appointments to hospitals, the provision of advice to the Minister on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and the preparation and publication of reports relating to hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1977, a joint working group of the Department of Health and Comhairle na nOspidéal produced a discussion document on the development of specialist services in Dublin. Following this, a final report was published in July 1980 which set out the designations of specialities within the Dublin hospitals in terms of regional, hospital and service units. This report would still be used by Comhairle na nOspidéal as a reference point in considering implications for consultant appointments to Dublin hospital services. However, both Comhairle and the Department would also take into account factors such as <Col N="1448" /> developments in medical technology, changing demographics and increasing specialisation in medical practice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding national specialities, as I stated in my reply of 2 March 1999, there are a number of formally designated national speciality services within individual hospitals in Dublin. These would include the National Cardiac Surgery Unit at the Mater Hospital, the National Liver Transplant Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital and the National Neurosurgery Centre at Beaumont Hospital, by way of example. In addition, some of the major acute providers offer services which are considered as national specialities by virtue of the degree of specialist expertise which has been developed within the relevant hospitals by individual consultants or the specialties concerned.</P>
    <P>National and regional specialties are provided as part of the individual hospital's overall services and as such are resourced within the hospital's total annual determination. The development of these centres of particular expertise is often due to the existence within the hospital involved of a range of complementary skills and technologies. It would not be possible to provide a breakdown of allocations to individual national and regional specialities.</P>
    <P>In the context of the proposed establishment of the new Eastern Regional Health Authority, there are a number of critical issues which fall to be considered regarding future arrangements for the formal designation of and funding arrangements for national specialty services. My Department has indicated to the chief executive officers of the major hospitals that this issue is currently under detailed consideration within the Department. We will be discussing the matter further with the hospitals and health boards in due course.</P>
    <P>The basis for the designation of national and regional specialities must also be seen within the context of my Department's policy objectives for regional self sufficiency in the delivery of acute services. The health strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; identified a number of priorities in this regard including the achievement of self sufficiency in regional specialties within each health board area and the provision of a small number of highly specialised tertiary or supra-regional units which would service much wider catchment areas and concentrate resources nationally to best effect. My Department is conscious of the need to continue to improve efficiencies in the delivery of acute services, both at regional and national level and to ensure that the patient interest is served at all times. The recently announced proposals for the establishment of joint structures for both the paediatric and maternity services serve as an example of a departmental initiative in this area. My Department is considering the scope for developing other collaborative networks within the acute sector with the aim of improving service provision at local, regional and national levels.</P>

      <P>Health boards and public voluntary hospitals are funded by my Department for a wide range of services covering in many cases both regional and national specialties. The management of services and the associated budgets is a matter for each health board and hospital. While patients are referred from one hospital to another for treatment, tests, etc, there are no public hospitals in general which have a specific block of funding provided by my Department related to another hospital which may be using its services. It might be noted, however, that the effective determination of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, includes a sum of £3.916 million in respect of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals. Also, in regard to the 1999 waiting list initiative, there is scope for an agency to reach agreement with another agency to carry out procedures on their behalf in order to maximise available capacity within the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244, 245 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities in the public hospital sector are available at Beaumont Hospital. The accepted tender for the installation of this MRI scanner in December 1991 was £1.8 million, which also included building works. No other tenders for MRI facilities have been obtained on behalf of my Department in the intervening period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the scanner is available to public patients at Beaumont Hospital during nor<Col N="1452" /> mal working hours, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. I have been advised that the MRI scanner at the hospital is made available to its private clinic each weekday from 5 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. and occasionally on Saturday mornings, depending on demand. Revenue of £420,000 per annum accrues to the public hospital for this service. The running costs for the MRI scanner at Beaumont Hospital are £940,000 per annum. I have also been advised that requests for MRI scans at the hospital are prioritised using strict protocols based on medical need. If an emergency MRI scan needs to be performed on public patients outside normal hours, these patients get priority. The Deputy will appreciate that the running costs for MRI facilities would vary with circumstance from site to site.</P>
    <P>My Department has been aware of the need to monitor and evaluate overall MRI requirements in the public hospital service. Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of MRI facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was commissioned from Professor David Banta, an international expert in health technology assessment. Professor Banta's findings were announced in 1997. As I have already outlined to the House, he identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>All three hospitals have now submitted applications to my Department for the development of MRI facilities on foot of the acceptance of Professor Banta's recommendations. My Department is currently in discussion with the management of the three agencies concerning the installation and operational requirements for their facilities. Once these discussions have been satisfactorily concluded, I am committed to making the necessary resources available for the provision of MRI facilities at the three sites. I am confident that this will have a positive impact on the overall waiting list and waiting times for MRI scans throughout the public health sector.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the pace of developments in this area is fast moving, both in terms of the technologies involved and their applications. I can assure the Deputy that the evolving needs of the acute hospital service for high-technology imaging facilities will be taken into consideration in implementing the commitments set out earlier.</P>

      <P>The development of services for intractable pain at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park and St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, is a matter, in <Col N="1454" /> the first instance, for the two hospitals concerned within their approved financial determination and the hospitals overall service priorities.</P>
      <P>The South-East Dublin Department of Anaesthesia is the co-ordinating body for the provision and development of anaesthetic services in the region, including pain management programmes. It is comprised of clinicians and management from the acute general hospitals in the region, including St. Vincent's Hospital and St. Columcille's Hospital. The south-east Department has developed an integrated plan for the delivery of pain management services across the region. The plan divides pain services into various sub-divisions from the initial consultant contact with the patient at out-patient or in-patient level, to the more sophisticated spinal implantation procedure.</P>
      <P>With regard to the service provided by St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, I was pleased to allocate additional funding to the hospital in 1999 to meet additional costs arising from the continued development of pain management services within the hospital, I should make the point that the pain management service at St. Vincent's Hospital is not an approved national speciality despite a significant number of referrals which are coming from outside the hospital catchment area. In relation to St. Columcille's Hospital, I understand that the Eastern Health Board is considering the purchase of additional equipment for this service which would allow extra procedures in this area to be performed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals adopted by the Midland Health Board on 17 April 1998 were considered in detail at a meeting of the National Cancer Forum on 20 May 1998. The forum was of the unanimous view that they should not be implemented because they would lead to a highly undesirable fragmen<Col N="1455" /> tation of services with consequent implications for the quality of care that could be offered to patients.</P>
    <P>The forum unanimously recommended approval of the plan for the development of cancer services, March 1998, known as the Hollywood report and this was adopted by the Midland Health Board on 17 September 1998. To date I have provided £650,000 to commence its implementation. The principles of the cancer plan, as unanimously supported by the National Cancer Forum, envisages the provision of intravenous chemotherapy at Tullamore general hospital and the use of oral chemotherapy at both Portlaoise and Longford and Westmeath general hospitals.</P>

      <P>Services for children with attention deficit disorder, ADD, come within the remit of the child and psychiatric services of the health boards.

The special needs of children with conditions such as attention deficit disorder, ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD, is being examined as part of the review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position in the Eastern Health Board, I understand that the recent departure of a key staff member from Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, has affected the provision of services for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Discussions have taken place between Our Lady's Hospital and the Eastern Health Board in relation to resuming the provision of services to children with this disorder. It is the intention of Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, to make an appointment to the vacant post in the near future in order to restore levels of service to patients.

    <P>The advice that I received from the CJD advisory group prior to taking the decision to inform patients was that the risk of transmission of new variant CJD through this product was unquantifiable but likely to be very low. The decision to inform patients was taken, on balance, following very careful consideration of the ethical issues involved having regard to the extremely low risk of transmission of the disease, the lack of a diagnostic test for new variant CJD, the lack of any treatment and the unknown incubation period of the disease. The extremely low level of risk involved was subsequently confirmed by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, CPMP, of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in a position statement of 25 February last year on new variant CJD and plasma-derived medicinal products. It concluded that the transmission of new variant CJD by med<Col N="1458" /> icinal products derived from human blood or plasma is very unlikely.</P>
    <P>All traceable recipients of the withdrawn Amerscan Pulmonate II product batches have now been contacted by the hospitals involved and have either had or been offered appointments for follow-up consultations with their treating physicians.</P>

    <P>The number of applications received in 1998 more than trebled over the previous years and the Eastern Health Board had difficulty in responding to the level of applications because of the difficulty in getting building contractors to tender for the work as a result of the boom in the building industry. In late 1998, the Eastern Health Board employed a second team of builders to undertake the work directly. The Eastern Health Board has informed me that early indications are that the two teams should go a considerable way to meet the demands of the service in 1999.</P>

      <P>Allowances are paid in respect of children who are in the care of health boards in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. The standard rate of allowance payable, effective from 5 June last, is £60.25 per child per week for those under 12 years of age and £73.75 per child per week for those over 12 years of age. In addition there are a number of discretionary payments made by health boards which cover items such as medical, school or clothing expenses.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment to develop foster care, the allowance for children over 12 years of age was increased last year by £6.25, in addition to the normal increase given in line with increases in Social, Community and Family Affairs allowances. This year the allowances for foster children under 12 will be increased by the same amount over and above the normal increases made in line with increases in the Social, Community and Family Affairs allowances. In addition for the first time last year a special payment of £100, over and above the normal Christmas bonus, was given in respect of each child in foster care in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are a number of issues in relation to foster care which need to be reviewed. These include the issues of recruiting, training and retaining foster parents, allowances, the provision of support for foster parents and foster children, foster care for children with special needs, foster care for children with behavioural <Col N="1460" /> difficulties and relative fostering. I therefore established, last October, a working group on foster care to review all aspects of foster care. Its membership includes nominees from the Department of Health and Children, the health boards, the Irish Foster Care Association and a foster parent.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group are as follows:</P>
    <P>Accepting that where a child requires care outside their own family, in particular if they require care for long periods, they should, as a general rule be cared for in another family; the Working Party on Foster Care is asked to make recommendations, as soon as possible, on all aspects of foster care and in particular in relation to the following areas:</P>
    <P>The requirements for the recruitment and training of foster parents;</P>
    <P>the ongoing training and support that should be provided for foster families;</P>
    <P>the development of relative fostering;</P>
    <P>the requirements for the further development of the foster care service;</P>
    <P>the support and training required for special fostering arrangements and</P>
    <P>the support and training required for fostering arrangements for children with behavioural problems.</P>
    <P>I expect that the group will be in a position to submit a report to me before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In addition I have established a number of pilot projects in relation to training, relative fostering and fostering for children with behavioural difficulties. This year I included in the net determination of the health boards a total of £1.1 million for a foster care package.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all of these initiatives will help to address any major difficulties there may be in relation to the provision of foster care services.</P>

      <P>The provision of accommodation for and statistics on the number of homeless adults is a matter for the relevant local authority. I understand that Dublin Corporation will be carrying out a comprehensive survey of housing need in its area of responsibility this month and will be reporting its <Col N="1461" /> findings to my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board operates a homeless persons unit at Charles Street West, Dublin 7, which arranges emergency accommodation for homeless adults and families on behalf of the relevant local authorities in the Dublin area. The board also provides income maintenance through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and advice and support to clients on access to the health, welfare and accommodation services available to them. The board, in co-operation with Dublin Corporation through the homeless initiative, funds voluntary organisations, providing outreach services to homeless people sleeping rough and to those providing day care services including meals. In addition, the board also provides a mental health service specifically for homeless persons including a hospital admission, treatment and day care service. The board points out that the number of persons sleeping rough changes from night to night but estimates that there are between 50 and 70 persons currently sleeping rough in the Dublin city centre area.</P>
      <P>As mentioned above, the board is involved with Dublin Corporation in a joint homeless initiative. This was established in 1996 with the aim of ensuring that services for homeless persons in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow area are provided more effectively, particularly through improving their planning, co-ordination and delivery. This is to be achieved through analysis, planning and the development of strong partnership between the agencies involved in service provision including the health board, the local authorities and voluntary agencies. This process is ongoing and I understand that the homeless initiative is due to produce a report by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, launched a Forum on Youth Homelessness in the Eastern Health Board on 25 February last. The purpose of the forum, is to bring together a group from the relevant sectors in the field of youth homelessness to draw up a plan to improve and develop services for young homeless people aged between 12 and 20 years in the board's area. A cross-Department team has also been established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to develop an integrated response to homelessness. The chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board has established a senior management committee to consider the health and social needs of the homeless and to submit a report to the cross Department team by the end of March.</P>

Under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland has undertaken to limit its increase in a basket of six greenhouse gases, including CO2, to 13 per cent above 1990 levels by the period 2008-12.</P>
      <P>Data prepared by the EPA for 1996, the latest date for which finalised data are available, show that the net increase for the greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol was 3.9 per cent above 1990 levels. These data also show that the increase in CO2 emissions above 1990 levels was 13.3 per cent.</P>

This figure includes discretionary grants of £511,000 which may be used to provide and maintain road markings and road or traffic signs. The selection of individual projects to be assisted from discretionary grants is a matter for the local <Col N="1472" /> authority and neither I nor my Department has any function in the matter.</P>

      <P>The rent payable to the voluntary housing body under the terms of the rental subsidy scheme is income related. The scheme was reviewed in November 1997 when reductions were made in the proportion of household and subsidiary incomes payable in rent and a maximum was applied to the rent payable in respect of subsidiary income. I have no proposals to introduce a maximum to the rent payable in respect of household income. The scheme is, however, being kept under review. In the context of rent payments, under the scheme, household income is the total gross income of the tenant and his or her spouse, if any, or of joint tenants, as the case may be, and subsidiary income is the income of any other person or persons resident in the house.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper on Voluntary Activity was published in 1997, with a view to initiating a consultation process with the voluntary and community sector leading to publication of a White Paper.</P>
      <P>A steering group has been brought together to advise and assist the Department on a consultation process in relation to the White Paper and to advise on issues and directions for the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The group's terms of reference are to advise on the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector and with relevant statutory agencies in relation to the White Paper; participate in same i.e. provide speakers as appropriate; mediate and comment on feedback and advise on issues and directions for the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention was that the White Paper be published before the end of 1998. However, at the steering group meeting on 28 May 1998 members of the group expressed concern that this might be too tight a timeframe to allow for adequate <Col N="1477" /> consultation with the voluntary and community sector and asked that this timeframe be extended for some three months or so, so as to ensure that time is available for the widest range of voluntary and community groups to be involved in discussions and debate about the forthcoming White Paper. As my primary concern in the preparation of the White Paper is to ensure that it reflects the issues that are of real importance to the sector and that there is genuine consultation in this regard, I have agreed to this request.</P>
    <P>The consultation process with the voluntary and community sector provided for a three phased approach. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The final phase will provide for a national seminar to which people, who have been involved in the initial phases, will be invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in its discussion papers.</P>
    <P>The first and second phases of the consultation process have now been completed. In this context, 72 submissions were received by my Department and 53 regional seminars have taken place in different locations around the country. The final phase is now being planned. The steering group is currently developing a number of discussion papers reflecting the issues which have been raised in the first two phases of the consultation process. The national seminar which will be held shortly, will provide the opportunity for people who have been involved in the initial phases to discuss the issues addresssed by the steering group in its papers. Following completion of the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector it is envisaged that the White Paper will be published before the end of the summer 1999.</P>

      <Col N="1479" /> Officials from my Department meet regularly, generally on an informal basis, with officials from the European Commission usually in the course of their attendance at meetings organised by the European Commission or the EU Council. The most regular of these meetings are the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers, which meets seven times per year approximately and the Group of Directors General for Social Security, which meets on average three times a year.</P>
    <P>Such meetings also afford the opportunity for my officials to meet their counterparts from other EU and European economic area, EEA social security administrations. Similar opportunities are availed of in meetings of Council of Europe and OECD committees.</P>
    <P>Meetings between officials from the UK Department of Social Security and my Department are held twice yearly to discuss the application of the EU regulations on social security for migrant workers, social security developments of mutual interest at EU level and at the international level generally, and developments at national level in both countries. The latest in this series of meetings took place in Dublin in January of this year.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department also met in February 1998 with their Dutch counterparts concerning workers posted to work temporarily in the Netherlands by their Irish employers and the implementation of the EU social security regulations in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference for the review are to examine the rationale for benefit-in-kind schemes; establish the correct charging mechanism for the services provided; identify the objectives of the free schemes; evaluate the extent to which those objectives have been achieved and remain valid; comment on how effectively and efficiently the free schemes have achieved their objectives; evaluate the extent to which the objectives warrant the allocation of public resources and, if so, whether the current allocation is appropriate; examine the scope for alternative policy arrangements; specify suitable performance indicators which <Col N="1480" /> can be used to monitor and evaluate these schemes in the future. The research conducted will be published in the <i>Trinity Studies in Public Policy </i>series. It is expected that the review will be completed by mid-year and published by the Policy Institute in October-November 1999.</P>

      <P>The committee of inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance, which was established, <i>inter alia</i>, to look at ways in which the cost of motor insurance could be contained, recommended that disability benefit should be taken into account when assessing damages for loss of earnings as a result of a road traffic accident. In its 1982 report, the committee argued that, as loss of earnings can constitute a very substantial proportion of large court awards when assessing damages arising out of road traffic accidents, it was not necessary for the purpose of achieving justice between the parties that an injured person should recover more than their full loss of earnings caused by the motor traffic accident. The committee was of the view that if it was considered that the injured person ought to be compensated over and above their full loss of earnings, then the court had the discretion to award interest on such loss of earnings.</P>
      <P>The then Government accepted the committee's recommendation in this regard and decided that provision be made in the 1984 Social Welfare Act for the taking into account of any payment of disability benefit or invalidity pension paid to the injured person in the five years following the accident, in assessing damages in any actions in respect of liability for personal injuries arising from a road traffic accident. This legislative provision is currently contained in section 237 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, a person who is unfit for work as a result of a road traffic accident can claim disability benefit or invalidity pension, depending on the extent of their injuries. The fact that the injured person may choose to take a court action for damages does not, in any way, affect their entitlement to social welfare benefits and they are not required to reimburse these payments to the State or any other party. However, in order to avoid double compensation, the court, in assessing any damages for loss of earnings, will <Col N="1481" /> take into account any payment of disability benefit or invalidity pension paid to the injured person in the five years following the accident.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit was disallowed in this case by a deciding officer following an examination by a medical assessor who considered that the person concerned was capable of work.</P>
      <P>In the context of his appeal against this decision the person concerned was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that he was capable of work. Following an oral hearing of his appeal on 6 October 1998, and taking account of all the available evidence in the case, an appeals officer decided that he was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts and disallowed his appeal.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of new evidence or new facts or any change of circumstances since the decision was given. Subsequent to the decision the person concerned wrote to the appeals officer to say that he had omitted to submit a report from his doctor. However, no new evidence was furnished and the appeals officer did not consider that a revision of his decision was warranted.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul, Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the pendant or panic button alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Older people who wish to apply for a grant under the scheme should contact the voluntary group or organisation in their local area prior to the purchase and-or installation of the necessary security equipment.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the operation of the scheme in 1999 will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>Carer's allowance is payable at a rate of 150 per cent of the maximum rate, less means, where a carer is caring for two or more persons.

      <P>The person concerned, who is in receipt of unemployment assistance since 1984 is self-employed as a cabinet maker and his wife as a cleaner. He is assessed with means of £37 per week derived from his own net earnings of £5 per week and his wife's net earnings of £32 per week. This assessment has been upheld by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>In assessing means from self-employment for unemployment assistance purposes any expenses incurred are deducted from the assessment. There are no plans to change the method of assessment of earnings from self-employment for the purposes of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>The SAC appeals advisory board has already begun work and will commence consideration of individual cases next week. The Deputy will be aware that local liaison committees are currently being established in SAC areas. These local committees will provide a forum at which the views and concerns of all those concerned can be expressed and, very importantly, these local committees will be represented on the SAC appeals advisory board. I urge all interested parties to involve themselves and participate in the local liaison committee process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to compensation, the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, provide that, in the event of agreement on <Col N="1488" /> compensation for loss of actual earnings not being reached with a landowner/user whose activities have been curtailed for reasons arising out of designation, the matter will be referred to arbitration under various Land Acts. In the light of these provisions, I see no necessity to establish a special compensation committee.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the contract for the provision of a computer system for the Irish Genealogical Project, IGP, formerly known as the National Genealogical Project.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the IGP was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to my Department in November 1997. The papers transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach indicate that in 1989 a number of companies were asked to submit a tender, based on a functional specification prepared by Digital Equipment Ireland Ltd, for the hardware-software costs associated with the provision of a computer system for the IGP and to quote separately for the cost of implementation. The tenders were assessed by the National Microelectronics Applications Centre Ltd. in March 1990 and a contract valued at £1,426,827, to be funded by the International Fund for Ireland, was awarded to Digital Equipment Ireland Ltd. later in 1990. During the period in question the IGP was managed by a management committee chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and including representatives of the Irish Family History Co-Operative; FÁS, Bord Fáilte and SFADCo.</P>
      <P>Work on the building of the IGP database is ongoing. I am at present considering a comprehensive review of the IGP which was completed earlier this year by my Department.</P>

      <P>Legal protection for all industrial developments initially devolves from the Planning Acts. In the case of industry wishing to develop industrial plants in conservation areas, proposed for designation by my Department, the planning authorities were requested to afford Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, an opportunity to make recommendations or submit reports in respect of any applications for planning permission likely to have an adverse impact on the ecology of proposed natural heritage area sites.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. 94/97), transposed the EU Habitats Directive into national legislation, and provided for the protection of special areas of conservation, SAC. These regulations oblige planning authorities, including local authorities, An Bórd Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency, to: </P>
      <P>(a)carry out an appropriate assessment of the environmental implications for the proposed SAC in view of its conservation objectives;</P>
      <P>(b)only grant permission for developments that will not adversely affect the integrity of the SAC;</P>
      <P>(c)impose any restrictions or conditions on the development which may be necessary to ensure the integrity of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is a negative assessment, and where the planning authorities are satisfied that there are no alternative solutions, planning permission may only be granted for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. In the case of sites hosting priority species, the only considerations of overriding public interest shall be those relating to human health or public safety, to beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment, or further to an opinion from the EU Commission to other reasons of overriding <Col N="1490" /> public interest. In the event that planning permission is granted to a development, damaging to the integrity of an SAC, the member state is required to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to ensure that the overall integrity of Natura 2000 is protected.</P>

As a result of the assessment of the proposal referred to by the Deputy, I am satisfied that the processes being proposed by the company will not adversely affect the conservation value of the site nor will they have a significant negative impact on the environment within the SAC. It has been proposed as a consequence of the main development to develop a new football pitch within the candidate SAC in a location where this would be environmentally damaging and Dúchas has lodged an objection with Donegal County Council in respect of this item only.</P>

      <P>The boundary of the Inagh river proposed natural heritage area, NHA, was determined by an ecological survey carried out on 6 May 1993. This survey effectively identified the extent of lands with a special conservation value. Initially it was thought that the area would merit designation as a special area of conservation. However, after further evaluation, it is now under consideration for designation as an NHA only. I understand that the areas around the village of Inagh referred to by the Deputy were never under consideration for any ecological designation.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is aware of a number of sites which groups wish to have extended to encompass additional lands. It is currently looking at those sites with a European interest. When these are completed, resources will be available to review the NHA boundaries. It may be some time before this becomes possible. However, it is unlikely that the area in question has sufficient ecological interest to attract a nature conservation designation.</P>

      <P>Phase I of works to the main block of Castletown House was completed in 1995 and involved replacing the entire roof and rebuilding the chimney and parapet. Phase II which involved mechanical, electrical, fire prevention and security works and structural repairs was completed in November 1998. Both phases were necessary to secure the fabric of the house and to install all the necessary infrastructure to ensure that it complies with the best current practice and standards for historic buildings in respect of fire, security, health and safety requirements.</P>
      <P>A range of other works, consisting primarily of structural works, site services and finishes in key areas are under way and will be completed before Castletown House reopens to the public.</P>
      <P>Actual expenditure on the three phases of works carried out to date amounts to some £4.2 million and approximately £1.3 million remains to be expended. All works to date relate to securing the fabric of the building and to protection of the  house from such hazards as fire and intrusion. A considerable programme of works remains to be done e.g. interior restoration in the house, the upgrading and provision of visitor facilities both in the house and in the demesne grounds generally and improving access. These works will require substantial Exchequer funding and will be carried out on a phased basis as resources permit over a number of years. As of now, no firm estimates of cost are available for these further works.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies of 2, 3 and 4 March 1999, to Questions Nos. 148, 324 and 118 respectively which set out the current position concerning the transfer of the traffic warden service to Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the terms and conditions of the employment of the traffic wardens with Dublin Corporation, including the question of any potential voluntary redundancies, are solely matters for the corporation as their future employer.</P>

      <P>The only project currently being developed on a public-private partnership basis is that of the Midlands Prison at Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>This project was procured on a design, build and finance basis. This means the contractor is responsible for the detailed design, the building of the project and the financing of the project. The Government will then make repayments on the project over 20 years. The contract for this project was signed in May 1998 and the project is expected to be completed in August 1999. An extension to the Midlands Prison is at present under negotiation with a contractor on a <i>pro rata </i>basis to the above project.</P>
      <P>In relation to possible further such projects, my Department has received expressions of interest from private investors which could in certain circumstances fall within the remit of the public-private partnerships.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the moneys to which the Deputy refers, are still the subject of legal procedures and processes and accordingly, I am not in a position to comment further on this particular case.</P>
      <P>In general, moneys and other property seized in the course of drug investigations become exhibits until all legal procedures are concluded. If the court makes a confiscation order in relation to a drug trafficking offence, under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the position is that, under section 22(2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, money paid or recovered in respect of a confiscation order is paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister for Finance. It would be contrary to standard public accounting procedures to transfer particular revenues to particular purposes. All revenues are taken in by the Exchequer and such allocations as are necessary are made through the normal Estimates process. Such moneys as are necessary for purposes of the kind referred to by the Deputy will be provided in the normal way through relevant Votes.</P>
      <P>Substantial funding has been provided for approved projects in the north inner city drugs task force area, as part of the Government's national drugs strategy.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics for 1996, the earliest year for which such figures were published, shows that there were 48 female prisoners in custody in Irish prisons at the time of the survey. This represented 2.2 per cent of the total Irish prison population on that day. The Deputy will see from the table I have forwarded to him that the number of females as a percentage of the total prison population was lower in Ireland that in any of the other countries surveyed. It may be of interest to the Deputy to know the highest percentage was 9 <Col N="1503" /> per cent. At unlock on Friday, 5 March there were 83 female prisoners in custody representing 3 per cent of the total Irish prison population.</P>

    <P>*There are no in-cell toilets in these institutions. However, these prisoners have 24 hour access to toilet facilities.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The practice of slopping out continues in Mountjoy, Cork, Portlaoise and Limerick prisons. Several areas of Limerick Prison have in-cell sanitation. Those prisoners without in-cell sanitation in Limerick Prison have access to toilet facilities until late lock-up at 9.30 p.m. Access beyond this time is at the discretion of the officer in charge in the interests of minimising the necessity for slopping out. In the prisons where slopping out is still practised every effort is made to minimise discomfort and maintain privacy, bearing in mind the need for security and good order.</P>
    <P>Since taking up office I have put in place a substantial programme of prison refurbishment and <Col N="1504" /> construction. The extensive refurbishment programme at the older prisons includes the replacement over the next year of the C wing at Limerick Prison and the D Block in Portlaoise Prison. The refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison, over a five year period, including the installation of integral sanitation, is planned to start as soon as possible following the opening of the new remand centre at Cloverhill. There are several areas of Mountjoy Prison where in-cell sanitation is provided. With the ongoing refurbishment programme this will become the norm throughout the prison rendering the practice of slopping out obsolete. While the refurbishment of Mountjoy is long overdue, it would simply not be possible to start in advance of additional prison accommodation being available.</P>

      <P>For reasons related to the United Kingdom's position on freedom of movement of persons and to the common travel area between both countries, neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom participate in the Schengen process. Now that the Schengen process is to be brought into the EU framework, the two countries may, if they wish, continue not to take part. Either or both, however, will also be able to opt in to all or part of Schengen, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Protocols added to the EU and EC Treaties, and a declaration made by Ireland annexed to the final Act, taken together, make it clear that Ireland's concern is to maintain the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom in order to maximise freedom of movement of persons into and out of Ireland; and that, subject to this, Ireland would wish to participate to the maximum extent possible.</P>

The purpose of the checkpoints is to monitor compliance with various enactments. Each agency operates in accordance with the law relating to its own area of responsibility. In the case of the Garda Síochána, the checkpoints are used to monitor compliance with the Road Traffic Acts. Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by the Road Traffic Act, 1968, places an obligation on drivers to stop vehicles and keep them stationary.</P>
      <P>Garda traffic department checkpoints have always been a regular feature of Garda operations and will continue to be so. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the multi-vehicle checkpoints have been a success to date and that, in appropriate circumstances, they will continue to give other agencies the oppportunity to participate in such checkpoints. Agencies exercise the option to participate, as their own operational needs require.</P>

      <P>The course referred to by the Deputy has been taking place at Templemore Garda College since 15 February 1999 and concludes on Friday next, 12 March. It is part of a programme involving training events in six member states of the European Union. In addition to attendance from EU member states there are participants from the Baltic States and Eastern European countries. The initiative is supported by the European Commission under the OISIN Programme and is co-funded by the Commission and the participating countries.</P>
      <P>During its Presidency of the EU in 1996, Ireland brought forward proposals for the establishment of a framework, including funding arrangements, to develop and enhance co-operation between EU police, customs and other law enforcement authorities. This initiative, known as the OISIN Programme, was adopted at the European Council in Dublin in December 1996. The programme envisages co-operation between member states' law enforcement authorities in the form of exchange and training. Projects may also involve the accession countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> The main aim of the police studies course is to develop the operational English language skills of the participants in order to promote more effective communication between police forces in specific police related situations. It also aims to develop their appreciation of the police and criminal justice systems of the Republic of Ireland.</P>

I would personally hope that EU funding available under the 5th European Union Framework Research Programme 1999-2004, might be of particular benefit in the area of researching doping agents and methods.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of co-operation and co-ordination in this field, the European Commission will, I understand, be consulting with sporting organisations and, in particular, the medical committee of the International Olympic Committee, both to set priorities for research and to evaluate projects submitted according to the procedures laid down in the framework programme.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council, when established on a statutory basis, will have responsibility for the operation of Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme. The Bill, providing for the establishment of the council and which includes a requirement to set up an anti-doping committee &ndash; chaired by a registered medical practitioner &ndash; has recently passed Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The national sports anti-doping programme, in line with the terms of the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, seeks a three strand approach to the reduction of doping in sport: (i) actual testing programmes; (ii) educational programmes and information campaigns exphasising the dangers to health inherent in doping, and its harm to the ethical values of sport; and (iii) research regarding both the devising of appropriate sports training programmes that respect the integrity of the human person, and programmes of research and development into doping agents and methods.</P>
      <P>Necessary preliminary steps for the implementation of the programme such as tender procedures for the taking, and independent analysis, of samples, and confirmation by individual NGBs of their willingness to participate in the programme, are currently under way. It is anticipated that, once established, the Irish Sports Council and its anti-doping committee in particular, will be in regular consultation with national governing bodies of sport in Ireland, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Council of Europe, the EU Commission, and other jurisdictions-international agencies on the progress of research, etc.</P>

      <P>Applications for financial assistance under the Sports Capital Programme have been received from the groups in question. These are among almost 1,900 applications which have been received and which will be considered when the grant allocations for 1999 are being made in accordance with the criteria for awarding such grants as set out in the terms and conditions of the new programme.</P>
      <P>Given the large number of applications received and the level of work involved in evaluating them, I do not expect to be in a position to make final announcements on the 1999 round of grant allocations for some time yet.</P>

      <P>Special Olympics places its highest emphasis on promoting participation in sporting activity. One of the founding principles of Special Olympics states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special Olympics celebrates and strives to promote the spirit of sportsmanship and a love of participation in sports for its own sake. To that end, Special Olympics aims to provide every athlete with an opportunity to participate in training and competition events which challenge that athlete to his or her fullest potential, <Col N="1515" /> regardless of the athlete's level of ability. Special Olympics therefore requires that Special Olympics Games and Tournaments offer sports and events which are appropriate for athletes of all levels of ability, and in the case of team sports, provide every athlete with an opportunity to play in every game.</P>
    <P>The international carding scheme was introduced in 1998 to provide a range of supports, both financial and non-financial, to assist Ireland's most talented players and athletes realise their potential to perform successfully at the highest international levels. This scheme replaced the outstanding sportspersons grant scheme operated by the Department of Education and Science between 1986 and 1997.</P>
    <P>It is not considered that the aims of the carding scheme &ndash; with its focus on the individual in terms of competitive international success &ndash; would be in accordance with the principles of the Special Olympics Movement. Special Olympics is a highly valued national governing body and its importance is reflected in the fact that it received funding in the sum of £136,217 in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 393 together.</P>
      <P>The estimates set out in the NESF report on early school leaving derive from research conducted by the Task Force on the Travelling Community in 1995. The research in qeustion indicated that of an estimated 5,000 traveller children of primary school age, 4,200 were attending primary schools at the time. Of the estimated 2,000 traveller children of second level age, it was estimated that 100 were attending mainstream second level schools. A further 300 places were available in junior education centres for travellers.</P>
      <P>The most recent information available to my Department indicates that 4,300 traveller children are attending primary schools. A further 200 children are attending special schools for travellers. The total of 4,500 children involved, includes approximately 740 children aged 12 and over. Children attending ordinary primary schools are supported by 369 resource teachers for travellers.</P>
      <P>The most recent information available also indicates that approximately 800 of the estimated 1,800 traveller children in the 12 to 15 age bracket are in receipt of an education service either in second level schools or in junior education centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's estimates of children leaving second level schools without qualification <Col N="1518" /> includes traveller children. The annual estimates of early school leaving before transfer to second level are based on the annual census of primary schools conducted by my Department and focus on leavers from ordinary national schools. They do not include children, including travellers, catered for within the special school system.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage participation by traveller children in the second level system and support second level schools catering for such children, my Department is introducing a special rate of capitation funding in respect of traveller children attending second level schools.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on the Travelling Community attached particular importance to the role of the visiting teacher service for travellers in fostering continued participation by traveller children in the education system at first and second level. In line with the task force's recommendation, I propose to appoint additional visiting teachers for travellers with effect from September next.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the need for improved monitoring of participation and retention rates among children generally and particularly children of the travelling community. One of the key objectives of the forthcoming Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, will be the introduction of efficient and effective procedures for monitoring school attendance by all children, including traveller children, and ensuring early intervention to support any child who drops out of the system or is in danger of doing so. The Bill will also provide for the effective exchange of information between the various bodies concerned with provision for traveller children and the issue of drop-out among this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 397 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>The 15 to 21 group who left school with poor qualifications is catered for by my Department under the Youthreach and the senior traveller training programmes which are administered by the vocational education committees. Participants in the VTOS programme must be over 21 years. The approved number of places under Youthreach and under the senior traveller training centres is currently 2,843 and 697 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> Both of these programmes are aimed at early school leavers with varying degrees of knowledge, ability and commitment. A prescriptive approach as to the numbers completing foundation level in first year and progression level in second year was not adopted at central level to ensure that local centres would have the maximum flexibility to respond to local needs.</P>
    <P>The average number of Youthreach participants in the VEC sector during 1996 was 1,736. Responsibility for the senior travellers programme was transferred to my Department from FÁS in April 1998 and details of participation rates for 1996 are not available.</P>
    <P>Information on participation rates in 1999 under both of these programmes is currently being gathered and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, early school leavers can obtain places on certain courses, such as hairdressing, in my Department's post leaving certificate programme. In these cases, the school authorities would first have satisfied themselves that individuals had the ability to benefit from the course despite their lack of formal qualifications.</P>

      <P>The Council of the European Union, usually known as the Council of Ministers, brings together member states' representatives, usually Ministers, to ensure the objectives set out in the treaty are attained. The European Counci,l or, as it has more commonly become known, the European Summit, is where Heads of State or Government meet. This normally takes place twice a year.</P>
      <P>Nowadays there are regular meetings of different types of Council of Ministers, which address particular issues. The Council of Education Ministers is one such council meeting, and it is the one, which is most appropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to attend.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have attended three formal meetings of the Council of Ministers and one informal meeting of the Council of Ministers. Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, attended an informal Educational Council in Baden, Austria, in October 1998 on my behalf. I also attended one meeting of European Ministers for Education, which brought together Ministers from the EU and Ministers from the countries of central and eastern Europe. In addition I have held various bilateral discussions with ministerial colleagues and the relevant commissioners.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the Council of Ministers, officials from my Department regularly attended Education Committee meetings, that is, the working group which prepares education matters for Council. This committee generally meets on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department regularly attend meetings with the Commission in relation to the current EU education and training programmes: SOCRATES, LEONARDO DA VINCI and YOUTH FOR EUROPE programmes. There are normally two or three meetings a year for each of the three programmes. In addition, my Department would also be represented on various <i>ad-hoc </i>working groups that are set up from time to time to discuss specific areas for co-operation in education and training matters.</P>

      <P>Children with special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. In some instances, such children can function quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of the remedial, resource or visiting teacher services. In other cases, the needs of the child can be such as to require placement in a special school dedicated to a particular disability or a special class attached to an ordinary school. All special schools and special classes enjoy significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios and receive special rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>My Department also makes funding available for the purchase of specialised equipment to assist children with special educational needs.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all children with special needs within the primary system will henceforth have an automatic entitlement to a response to those needs. The response may take the form of additional teacher support or child care support or both, depending on the needs of the individual child. The response in question will be available, irrespective of the number of children involved or their location. This initiative will be of particular benefit to children with special educational needs who wish to participate in the education system on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> My Department is currently finalising detailed circulars which will advise all primary schools on the procedures to be followed if they wish to make application for support for special needs children. I expect that the circulars in question will issue very shortly.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is under active consideration in my Department. I will support any measure which will be of benefit to special needs children.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the benefits which can accrue to some children through being able to attend a special school for a number of days per week and attend an ordinary school for the remainder of the week. In the special school, the child has the benefit of the more intensive support services available in such facilities. In the ordinary school, the child can benefit from mixing with his or her peers and generally enjoy a greater degree of socialisation.</P>
      <P>The key issue is one of ensuring that any necessary special support services are made available to enable the child to function successfully in both situations. Depending on the needs of the child, such supports might involve the allocation of additional teaching hours, child care assistant support or the provision of specialised equipment to the ordinary school.</P>
      <P>In some situations, the needs of the child might be such as to also require special transport arrangements.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining how best to structure the necessary responses to ensure that children availing of a dual attendance arrangement derive maximum benefit in both locations.</P>

      <P>My Department, has not, as yet, assigned an educational psychologist to St. Mary's boys' national school in Maynooth. The psychological service available to this school would currently be provided by the Eastern Health Board. At present, the six national schools in Leixlip are assigned to a psychologist employed by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am addressing this issue by establishing a national educational psychological service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase, and expansion of the service will begin during 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It will not be possible to make the service immediately available to all schools. A detailed analysis is currently being made in my Department of the needs and resources available in each county, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service. Information about schools in all parts of the country, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, will be taken into account in setting the priorities. It is envisaged that, at the end of the five-year period, every school in the country will have access to an educational psychological service.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of clerical services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £15 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the school referred to by the Deputy does not qualify for an additional capitation grant for clerical services at this stage as its current enrolment of 161 pupils is below the qualifying threshold. However, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to further improvements in this programme until such time as all primary schools of 100 pupils or over will ultimately be assisted towards the cost of clerical services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past year, the provision of psychological services by my Department has been enhanced by the recruitment of additional 15 psychologists to work in primary schools. Three of these psychologists have been assigned to schools in Counties Galway, Mayo and Sligo. A list of the schools served is part of this reply. My Department's psychological service is not yet <Col N="1530" /> available to primary schools in Counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford. Provision of a psychological service to primary schools in those counties is at present a matter for the relevant health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service does not keep waiting lists of named students in the schools that it serves. However, an important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. In this way, the psychologist is able to estimate the numbers of students in each school who may need psychological intervention and consequently the amount of time that needs to be spent in each school.</P>
      <P>The estimated level of need nationally for a psychological service was investigated by the planning group for the national educational psychological service and is recorded in its report, which I launched during September of last year. The planning group drew upon the report of the Special Educational Review Committee (1993) as well as on epidemiological studies carried out in other jurisdictions and on the experience of the existing psychological service. As much available evidence as possible was analysed by a technical working group set up by the planning group. The final estimate made in the report was that 11.2 per cent of the school population might expect to be referred at some stage to the psychological service.</P>
      <P>The provision of resource teachers is part of my Department's response to the needs of mainstream schools, which are fully integrating children with special educational needs arising from disabilities. Documentary evidence of disability is required in each case. This would take the form of a report or reports from specialists. In certain cases, a psychological report may be appropriate. Any qualified psychologist may provide this, whether employed by my Department, by the relevant health board or by a voluntary agency. Applications for resource teachers have been granted to many primary schools where my Department does not yet have a psychological service.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the need for students, parents and teachers in all areas of the country to have ready access to the support of educational psychologists. The expansion of provision is one of my priorities as Minister. On Thursday, 11 February, I announced Government approval for the establishment this year of a national educational psychological service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It will not be possible to make the service immediately available to all schools. A detailed <Col N="1531" /> analysis is currently being made in my Department of the needs and resources available in each county in order to set priorities for the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service. Information about schools in all parts of the country, including those counties mentioned by the Deputy, will be taken into account in setting the priorities. It is envisaged that, at the end of the five-year period, every school in the country will have access to an educational psychological service.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. This commitment is reflected by the fact that I obtained an increase of £5 in the standard rate of capitation grant in 1998 and a further £10 increase in 1999 which has brought the standard capitation grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes a 33 per cent increase in the grant, since I assumed office. These increases in the capitation grant represent major steps in the process of increasing funding <Col N="1533" /> at primary level. I would point out to the Deputy that this capitation was frozen in 1997.</P>
      <P>In relation to the difference in grant between secondary and primary schools it is important to note that this difference reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second-level schools are much greater on a unit-cost basis. In addition, the second-level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of expenditures.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to continuing to effect significant improvements in the level of funding at primary level over the coming years.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This is the scheme under which Sancta Maria primary school qualified for a shared secretary arrangement with Scoil na mBráthar, Francis Street, Dublin 8. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full-time secretaries in posts which are being shared. In the circumstances it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of an additional full-time secretary to either school.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services. This is the scheme under which the Sancta Maria primary school is assisted towards the cost of caretaking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil (£15 for each service), based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The level and extent of service provided is a matter for local school management who have discretion as to how the grants are to be applied for these services. Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its <Col N="1534" /> current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>Sancta Maria primary school is currently in receipt of £3,465 per annum (231 pupils x £15) towards caretaking services, which is the maximum amount available to the school under the current terms of the scheme. Since this is the appropriate amount payable  under the scheme, it is not open to my Department at this stage to make an additional grant available to the school.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services and the position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the  future.</P>

For this reason, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>First, I ensured that the intake of students to the College of Education in the current school year was increased to over 1,000. This includes 748 students pursuing the three year B.Ed. degree programme, in addition to 280 degree holders who have commenced an 18 month full-time postgraduate teacher training course. I am committed to maintaining this level of intake over the next number of years.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I have arranged that B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who have Irish either as part of their degree or to higher level grade C in the leaving certificate or its equivalent. I further decided that from September 1998 all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education shall be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service. Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the three year course at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the NCEA shall also be granted recognition for substitute service with effect from September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that 500 newly-trained teachers will qualify at the end of the current academic year. I am satisfied that the supply of trained teachers will be adequate to fill the permanent posts arising in September next, including the additional teaching posts which I announced yesterday. However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the shortage of trained teachers in the system cannot be completely eliminated in the short-term. The Deputy will appreciate that this has been the situation for some years but that <Col N="1536" /> it will, as a result of the improvements I have mentioned, improve over the coming year.</P>
    <P>However, I am committed to ensuring that there will be a sufficient supply of trained teachers to meet all the future needs of the primary education system, and I am satisfied that the initiatives I have already introduced will go a long way towards achieving this target.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to reduce the current maximum number of pupils in view of the pupil teacher ratio currently 35:1 and the fact that the current level makes it difficult to provide a child centred curriculum in a disadvantaged area; when he will introduce this measure; the implications this will have on the number of teacher training places in the forthcoming and following academic years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I should clarify that the current pupil teacher ratio is, in fact, 21.2:1. The Deputy's reference to 35:1 relates to my Department's guidelines on maximum class size for single grade classes. I should also point out that a special maximum class size of 29 already exists in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to the level of class sizes, and since taking office I have been determined to improve significantly the conditions in which young children learn. As I announced yesterday, the Government has agreed to the allocation of further primary teaching posts in addition to the full retention of existing teaching posts already signalled in the budget. This initiative will mean that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class of 30 pupils, and take effect from the commencement of the next school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I have ensured that the intake of trainee teachers to the colleges of education was increased to over 1,000 in the current school year. This is double the figure in the colleges at the time this Government took up office. I am committed to maintaining this level of intake over the next number of years, and I am satisfied that sufficient trained teachers will be available to meet the demands arising from the additional teaching posts being allocated.</P>

      <P>Last year in the interests of greater openness and transparency, I arranged for candidates, for the first time ever, to have access to their marked examination scripts in many subjects. As a result, candidates were able to inform themselves regarding the accuracy of the marking and in the light of this, make an informed decision regarding the need to appeal. The measure was introduced with effect from the 1998 examinations and did not apply retrospectively to earlier examinations.</P>
      <P>With in excess of one million scripts received each year, my Department's policy is to dispose of these scripts on an annual basis. Scripts which have been the subject of an appeal are retrained for an additional year before disposal. Thus scripts appealed at the 1997 examination were disposed of at the end of 1998. The script in question in this case was the subject of an appeal and was disposed of along with the other appeal scripts for 1997. Accordingly the issue of granting access does not arise.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available. However, health and safety projects are processed expeditiously by my Department and every effort is made to ensure that the appropriate level of resources is allocated towards the relevant works at individual schools.</P>
      <P>The most recent information available also indicates that approximately 800 of the estimated 1,800 traveller children in the 12 to 15 age bracket are in receipt of an education service either in second level schools or in junior education centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's estimates of children leaving second level schools without qualification includes traveller children. The annual estimates of early school leaving before transfer to second <Col N="1539" /> level are based on the annual census of primary schools conducted by my Department and focus on leavers from ordinary national schools. They do not include children, including travellers, catered for within the special school system.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage participation by traveller children in the second level system and support second level schools catering for such children, my Department is introducing a special rate of capitation funding in respect to traveller children attending second level schools.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on the Travelling Community attached particular importance to the role of the visiting teacher service for travellers in fostering continued participation by traveller children in the education system, at first and second level. In line with the task force's recommendation, I propose to appoint additional visiting teachers for travellers with effect from September next.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the need for improved monitoring of participation and retention rates among children generally and particularly children of the travelling community. One of the key objectives of the forthcoming Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, will be the introduction of efficient and effective procedures for monitoring school attendance by all children, including traveller children, and ensuring early intervention to support any child who drops out of the system or is in danger of doing so. The Bill will also provide for the effective exchange of information between the various bodies concerned with provision for traveller children and the issue of drop-out among this group.</P>

      <P>The constitution of UNESCO provides that each member state should make its own administrative arrangements in relation to the work of UNESCO. For many countries, this takes the form of a national commission involving Government Ministries and other interests involved in the areas that come within UNESCO's competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1987 and 1991 matters relating to UNESCO were administered by the Department <Col N="1540" /> of Education and Science and the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with other Government Departments as appropriate. In order to provide for wider consultation on UNESCO issues, the Minister for Education in 1991 invited other relevant Government Departments to participate in an interdepartmental committee known as the Irish National Committee for UNESCO. The members of the committee who represent their Department are as such not appointed; but assume their position on the committee by virtue of the responsibility assigned to them for UNESCO matters in their respective Departments.</P>
    <P>The current membership of the committee and their dates of appointment are as follows: Mr. John Dennehy, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, is an <i>ex-officio </i>chairman of the National Committee for UNESCO, (15-1-98); Mr. Sé Goulding, Department of Education and Science, (20-2-97); Ms Eilish Bergin, Department of Education and Science (10-11-97); Ms Mary Collins, Department of Education and Science (25-5-98); Mr. David Cooney, Department of Foreign Affairs, (9-9-98); Mr. Patrick Sammon, Department of Foreign Affairs (2-1-97); Mr. Conor O'Malley, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (7-9-95); Mr. Eugene Keane, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (1-6-91); Ms Veronica Healy, Department of the Environment and Local Government (7-9-95); Mr. Michael Pender, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (3-9-93).</P>
    <P>While it is not envisaged at present that other Government Departments will be required to assign an official to the committee, it is open for them to do so if considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Since 26 June 1997, members of the committee represented Ireland at the UNESCO General Conference held in Paris in November 1997. Ireland was also represented at the World Conference on Higher Education in Paris in 1998, World Conference on Adult Education in Hamburg in 1997 and the General Assembly of the World Heritage Convention in September 1997 in Paris.</P>

This extension of service will be in place for the 1999-2000 school year. An additional 600 teacher posts are being made available from the commencment of the next school year.
